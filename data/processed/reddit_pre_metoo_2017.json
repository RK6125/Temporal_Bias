    "text": "EXPENDABLE - My 2 Years As A Blizzard Entertainment 'Game Master' My apologies for this novel!\n\nWorking for Blizzard was one of my dreams since 2005 when the WoW hype train started gaining major steam. For years, I applied only to get cut before an interview was ever granted. Still, I never gave up, always applying for positions I was qualified for whenever they were added to the Blizzard recruitment page.\n\nThen it happened\n\nThe day before Halloween in 2013, after having finally been granted an interview, I received a call from the team I had interviewed with to congratulate me and offer me the job of Game Master, a position I instantly accepted (for those that may not be aware, Blizzard Game Master is another name for their Customer Support associates) Training began two weeks later which was awesome. Getting to be onsite, experiencing Blizzard Entertainment HQ in Irvine for the first time, and as an employee to boot. It was the start of something incredibly magical for me; a journey I had been longing to embark on for almost a decade.\nSlowly but surely, however, that dream plummeted to the depths of nightmares. \n\nOnce training had ended, it became very clear just how unimportant and expendable Game Masters truly are within the company. Up until just before my addition to the company, I had found out that Game Masters were not regarded like all the other Blizzard Entertainment employees, for instance when company events and outings would occur, Game Masters simply were not invited. Though that was not the case when I started, Game Masters were still looked upon by the rest of the company as the \"Red Headed step-child\" of Blizzard, even having a completely different colored badge than anyone else in the company which created an unspoken hierarchy class system around HQ among the employees (think Blizzard Entertainment being Snowpiercer with Game Masters in the very back and their own special colored badges so you know they're the little guy).\n\nStill, this was not my first corporate job so being the low man on the company totem pole was nothing new to me and I assumed with time and my hard work, I'd be looked at as a valuable member of the Blizzard machine.\n\nThis was something that never came to fruition.\n\nWhat made this most difficult was the fact that the management team within Blizzard Entertainment HQ customer support did not seem like they actually lead their respective teams, instead simply being a boss behind a desk who only gave orders and just shrugged when their associates had concerns about the job, morale, and treatment within the customer support team. While the Game Masters were handling call after call, ticket after ticket, 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week, handling Blizzard customers who more often than not talked to Game Masters like a heated high school student who knows they can get away with saying anything they want online, management was at their desks having the time of their lives. Of course this was part of the job but being screamed at on a regular basis, over and over, while your bosses sit at their desks loudly talking to each other about what movies they saw over the weekend, playing games, demeaning women, and doing nothing that showed any sort of actual work or concern for their employees, whom they knew were all drained of morale.\n\nNow keep in mind that the language at Blizzard is pretty free (managers / employees use foul language on a regular basis, even in meetings, but it's always in a manner that's not hostile).\nFast-forward to late Spring 2015, to me taking my concerns about Game Master treatment to my general manager, telling him via email that the constant schedule changes, complete disregard for Game Master concerns, and the overall lack of attention to their own team had driven many of us to a company outlook based more on animosity than the amazing experience working for a major video game company should be \n(ESPECIALLY one as big as Blizzard). A few days later, I get pulled into the HR office with the general manager where he (we'll call him Justin) began cussing me out right in front of my HR rep (we'll call her Erin) because he didn't appreciate me bringing my concerns to his attention in the fashion I did, along with the fact that my concerns had not been voiced by any other employees to the management team, leaving me as the lone \"whistle-blower\". Erin looked at him while he continued to berate me in the HR office, but most likely due to being 5'1\", mid twenties, 6-months pregnant, and only a recent addition to the customer support team, Erin did nothing to stop this sudden and inexcusable treatment I was receiving from Justin and instead just sat there in silence. Sadly, at home that evening I had what the doctor's office verified the following day as an anxiety-induced emotional breakdown because of it (something I had never experienced before and what was incredibly terrifying).\n\nA month goes by and then without warning, having never been reprimanded or written up in my almost two years with the company, I received a written final warning based on my emails voicing my concerns to the Justin (the ones which lead to my meeting with him and Erin). Yes, inexplicably 1 full month after that meeting with nothing having happened in between. Instantly livid, I walked right into the HR office and demanded to speak with her (Erin’s) boss as I no longer trusted her since she failed to defend me when being cussed out by Justin right in front of her; her excuse was \"That kind of language is acceptable in this company\" to which I replied \"Only if it's used in a way that used by a manager to intimidate a subordinate\". She had nothing to say in reply to that.\n\nA week later, I was finally connected with her boss, however it was through a conference call as he was out of state. The call lead nowhere, simply leading back to me as being the issue having voiced my concerns in a way that Justin did not appreciate (but for some reason Justin cussing me out in front of HR was brushed aside and was not a concern during the call, regardless of how adamant I was of the issue) My continued cries for help went ignored through the company.\n\nFrom there, knowing I was almost out of options, and knowing Justin's boss (we'll call him Tony) was out of the country, I went to the next person up the ladder (we'll call him Todd) who's office is also at the Blizzard Irvine HQ, being one of the highest rungs on the Blizzard customer support ladder. Todd had always been a very available individual, always telling the team that his door was open to discuss any issues we may have. Suddenly though, that door seemed always closed. My email to him detailing the issue that I was in and the fear for my own employment (suddenly being on final written warning after no previous warnings of any kind means I could be tossed for literally anything) was completely ignored. This was the last person I could go to without starting to climb the executive ladder outside of customer support. But again, my cries for help were ignored.\n\nA company, one of which who's main words to live by: \"Every Voice Matters\", had completely disregarded the voice of a Game Master, one of their own employees, who saw the treatment of customer support by its own managers, saw the outlook from the rest of the company on customer service, the main contact point between Blizzard as a company and Blizzard's millions of domestic and international customers, was one that was completely expendable. It didn't matter if you were happy or not, if you felt that you were being mistreated by management, that your higher-ups were not only taking advantage of the rules, but were breaking them on a regular basis whenever it suited them and yet didn't stand by those same rules when their associates came to speak to them (or simply plead ignorance).\n\nDecember 2015, two weeks before Christmas, and just over two years after I had been hired, I was brought into a small corner office with Erin from HR and my hiring manager (we'll call him Nick; another managerial individual who could care less about the morale of his own employees) and was told, with nothing to show for it, that I was being fired for \"Excessive use of the internet\", something that was not brought to my attention at my team lead one-on-one meeting with Nick just two weeks prior, nor had it ever been mentioned as something that was possibly endangering my employment in my two years with the company (which was funny since my one-on-one's always consisted of Nick telling me that I was doing far more than the majority of the Game Masters and that I didn't have to feel \"tied to my desk\" so to speak). Completely shocked, I knew that the real reason I was being fired had to do with Justin and the meeting months ago where he cussed me out that had subsequently been disregarded by HR, management, and the multiple other people I sought out help for.\n\nIt seemed to me that instead of dealing with Justin who was clearly out of line and had broken major company and ethics rules, and dealing with Erin’s lapse of judgement when she failed to stop Justin's outbursts, it was simply the team trying to save itself when they knew they were in the wrong and instead was much easier to get rid of the one Game Master involved, most tragically during the holiday season.\n\nI was crushed. My hopes that I was one day going to move up the ranks and eventually be part of the production team for Blizzard instantly obliterated simply due to Justin's emotional outburst, which he was never punished for and funny enough now has a position with Blizzard HR. It's so hard for me to look back on Blizzard and think that I wanted to work there back in the day. As well, it's tough not to look back on HR, who are supposed to be the ones to do something about things like this, being witnesses to the outburst and remaining mute. Sadly, the only outlook I have now on Blizzard Entertainment is that they fail to go to bat for their employees when one of their leads was clearly out of control, and no matter how hard someone works to make the company what it is, they can be brushed off simply because they are a Game Master; something that is seen by Blizzard Entertainment associates high and low as the absolute gutter of the company.\n\nIf you took the time to read that whole post, I thank you!",

    "text": "As a soon to be 27 year old male, who has a Bachelors degree in Political Science, and soon to have an Associates in Homeland Security, how do I acquire a job? Dont really know what Im doing. Edit: Sorry again for the giant rant blog post. I dont even know if this was the right subreddit to even post this too, or even if I should've posted this at all. Just kinda spontaneously happened\n\nHonestly, I dont think posting this question will really do me any good and all, mainly because of my own incompetence, but I figured I have all the free time in the world so I dont think it could hurt to try.\n\nIm 26 soon to be 27 year old male who has lived with my parents all my life. I graduated with a Bachelors in Political Science at the age of 22, so I figured I was on track and on time to living a normal life like everybody else. I dont actually care for the subject I majored in. It was just my parents always told me that having a college degree is better than not having a degree, so I went off to college and became the first one in my family to get a degree, or at least a Bachelors I think. I figured I was never going to have the intelligence/will/skill/enthusiasm to be something like a Doctor/Engineer/Businessman, but I also figured Political Science wasn't on the bottom tier like Underwater Basketweaving or something like that. Figured I had chosen a decent middle of the road major. \n\nI wasnt an honor roll student during the time at the 4 year college I went to, but I think I am at the community college Im currently going to to obtain my Associates in Homeland Security, though I dont think that really counts since I take a low amount of classes each semester, though I will be having the Associates by the end of this December I think.\n\nAnyways after I got the Bachelors, my father would look online for Jobs for me, since I have not even the slightest clue on how to look for jobs. I figured it would make more sense for my parents to look since they have all the life experience and are responsible adults who've already done this. Couldnt really find anything for 6 months. \n\nThen my only real life friend who I still have in close proximity told me to come work with him at Giant Grocery Store. My parents told me its better to have SOMETHING on my resume, to show that Im willing to work, even if it is just at a grocery store. To show that Im not sitting on my ass all the time. So I work their for 1.5 years, simply as a Salad Bar Clerk. Had no problems with the job at all, I liked the people there, figured it could always be much worse. I had perfect attendance there, while everybody else in my Department would call out sick every other week. I was hired part time, but they eventually pushed my hours beyond 40, even though I still wasnt considered full time. I didnt really want more hours, all I wanted was to just have something on my resume saying that I didnt sit on my ass all the time. Figured it was kinda an interesting *problem* since every other worker in the store would complain about a lack of hours, while they kept increasing mine. Whenever my managers would ask me to stay later for whatever reason, I never declined, even if I didnt want to, because I figured I got nothing better to do, and Im a complete beta male who can't really say no.\n\n Heck, I remember we hired this 1 foreign chick who couldnt really speak or understand english, yet was supposed to close the Salad Bar on her first day of work, which I knew there was no way in hell I could successfully teach her verbally and I would get off work earlier than her, so she will inevitably screw up and then make us be behind the next day, so I decided to come in on my own time off the clock and stay with her for 2-3 hours closing the salad bar with her just to have an on the job first hand understanding on what to do. Luckily my manager saw this and thanked me. \n\nSo anyways I eventually put in my 2 weeks, because I wasnt sure if working there was actually helping me find a government job or not. I figured if this wasnt helping, maybe I needed more schooling? Maybe I majored in something bottom tier and I was just too stupid to know better? My managers seemed to try really hard to make me not quit, since they knew they could rely on me to consistently do what I've been doing. Which by the way, I wasn't even remotely close to the best in the Salad Bar. My superior was this lady who was like 10 times more productive than me, but I still felt appreciated even when I clearly wasnt the best. They even gave me a cake when I left. (Though I have no idea if thats standard operating procedure and Im just reading too much into it and hyping myself up because of my ignorance)\n\nAnyways, I put in an application for the TSA. I passed all their tests and then got invited for an interview. I failed the interview for some reason. They dont tell you why. Which really bummed me out. I figured if I never know what I did wrong I could never improve myself. So I was really starting to get sad. \n\nI think I graduated from Salisbury in Maryland in 2013. Then late 2013 started to work at Giant for 1.5 years and then left during 2015.\n\nEver since 2015, I havent worked anywhere. My parents have tried putting applications in whatever they could find, though an overwhelming amount of them require much more education than I currently have, and something required me to have been an honor roll student, or various other things. By the way, this is just what my parents have told me, I have never actually looked for a job myself, because I cannot even begin to formulate a thought on how to start. My logic is my parents would know better than me. \n\nI think this is where I should say my parents are the greatest parents in the world, I dont even need to know any of you or anybody else to make such a declaration. I dont think my parents are rich, but I think they are definitely above middle class I think. Im not sure really. Dad said he might close to 6 figures and Mom made much less than that, but for a family of 3 that seems pretty good to me, my apologies if I really have no clue to what the answer is, I think I've lived a sheltered life, well, at least since highschool and beyond, no idea how to make friends anymore, since all the ones I had in Elementary school and Middle school have moved to other states and such. So much easier as a kid, so I basically stay inside my room all the time. I mean I've pretty much never had to do chores around the house! Like ever! I've barely ever taken out the trash, wash dishes or clothes, vacuum, etc etc the entire course of my life so far. They dont even complain about me! I ask them all the time if it was better if I just went somewhere else to not be a parasite on them anymore but they always tell me its okay dont worry about it. My Dad always tells me its not my fault, its just the bad economy or something, though I personally dont believe that. I think its clearly something wrong with me. I just wish I had a \"How to figure out Life\" guide or something\n\nHell as Im typing this I cant help but think how damn lucky I am to have parents like this. I make sure to not act like a brat, and whenever they tell me to do something for them, Ill certainly do it. But anyways, I think I've been getting off track and sadly this seems more like a blog post or something so now I think Im starting to regret even typing this out because now it might seem cringey as fuck or something, which it probably is. Im basically admitting Im just a giant man child\n\nSo ever since leaving Giant, I havent found a job. I dont know if I should just give up on even thinking about getting a gov job. Maybe I should go back to working at Giant? Or somewhere else? I have no idea. I know my Dad would say maybe working at Giant is not so bad since maybe you could work your way up and do some security stuff, i dont know. \n\nIn reflection, I really dont think I have any skills worth a damn. I know Im somebody who will never miss a day of work. Hell I had perfect attendance in middle school and got an award for it which made me feel special. But when I look on Facebook at all the buddies I used to know, people who never had opportunity like me, who never had amazing parents like I had, who never even went to college like me somehow have their life in order. People who from what I assume to be self sufficient individuals who have figured out their formula for life. I just get some damn jealous. \n\nWell, thats all I can think of at the moment. Im sure theres some more important information I could've listed. But frankly Im already embarrassed as hell that I somehow made some ridiculous blog post. But at this point. I think Ill take some hits to my ego just for some advice. It doesnt have to be good or anything, Im sure there are plenty of people worse off than me or something, but if you dont mind, Id like to know what I should do. Should I just find some random private sector job and start working immediately? Just to continue building the resume? Surely its better than me not doing anything at all for the past 2 years",

    "text": "Any words of wisdom? So I am working at a sporting goods store that has a sandwich shop inside and have been working this job for two years. My supervisor has only been in my department for one year and she has tried to put me down if I don't have enough time to finish stuff and it is left to be finished the next day. She has done some other stuff like going off for 45 minutes to an hour without telling us where she is going and not doing her job 's responsibilities. She has also denied one of my coworkers medical- necessarily breaks that she has a doctor's note for. The thing is that she has done the running off and not doing her job when she was in her previous department. \n\nNow I've notice when my manager does the sechduling, he only schedules me one day a week to work with her, and it has been usually Saturdays, if I work that is. I also work in other departments when they usually need the extra man power.  I have also applied for other positions within the store and one is under the same manager but different department. \n\nNow I have been told that our manager and the store manager is aware of the stuff that she is doing and are planning on having a meeting with her, but I know that she has lied to get herself out of trouble before. And she has also told another coworker that if she is fired she will pull the race card (she's african-american). So what I am asking is that should I report this to my company's hotline  or just wait it out?\n\nEDIT: I have should have added I love my job and the people I work with it is just that I shouldn't have to go in to work worrying that if I slip up just once, I'm going to get reprimanded for a simple mistake, that she has made too.",

    "text": "As a girl who ended up not aborting, I am more pro-choice than ever. It is your life. Hello everyone.\n\n\nFirst of all, I would like to apologize in advance for the numerous grammar mistakes I will be making, since English is not my first language. Also, I am very tired and my head is foggy writing this with less than 3-5 hours sleep for the last 2 weeks, so there is a possibility this will be a incomprehensible mess.\n\n\nQuick back story: I am 21-years-old with a baby who is 1 year and 8 months old. I became pregnant at 19 for my then-boyfriend-ish dude. He isn't really in the picture anymore, with his whole heart. He has his own life with a new girlfriend, he studies, he parties, he goes on vacations. He has a fun and active life. That fun and active life doesn't leave that much of time for our daughter. His effort is maybe once a month, usually a lot less, reaching out to ask how she is doing, otherwise it is 99% of time me who sends the whatsapp messages (who are left unanswered) and calls (who he seems to ignore happily pretty often), trying to get him see our daughter. \n\n\nHe doesn't pay child support since he is a broke student, but most of all we had a deal of leaving third parties out of this to have his relationship with her as good as possible. In his words, he will make it up with love with what he can't pay. Obviously I am considering to break our \"deal\" since he has 0 respect to it anyway. It will be a long, exhausting fight where I will be the cruel, money-thirsty manipulating bitch, his new girlfriend will see me doing this because I want to sabotage their relationship and he will be the victim.\n\n\nAnyway, this post wasn't about my ex, I don't know why I wrote about him. Maybe because I just saw his instragram travelling photos from exotic beaches and felt a sting of jealousy and saddness. \n\n\nAs I said, I was 19 when I became pregnant. You know those girls who say \"I _always_ wanted to be a mother!\"? Yeah, I am the complete opposite of that. I can't understand that, like someone would be speaking a different language. What do you even mean with that?? How can someone dream of having children? My first instinct was to abort, immediately after I took the test. I don't like kids. I never wanted to be a mother. I never, for a second, dreamed of having kids in my life. \n\n\nMy then-boyfriend, took a strong pro-life stand, but made it clear he will respect my choice even if I abort. He didn't push or bully me to anything, let's make that clear. What he did do, though was that he did manipulate me with a rosy view how fun it will be to play with our little kiddo. In his mind it was only ponies and rainbows. I thought we will raise this kid together. He told me so, very clearly.\n\n\nI did book an abortion date. The days before that after school I spend scrolling through pro-life-websites, youtube-videos, sites (even reddit) where women like me where called a whore, why didn't I use contraception, this is my punishment, I will go to hell for this. I could spend 9-10 hours glued on my phone and fall asleep at 3-4 in the morning, since I was too anxious to sleep. My mom was the only one who was relieved that I will abort and supported me. My crazy religious relative (the nuts one in our family) who got to know about my situation and harassed me that I will \"pay for my sins\". Good stuff like that. \n\n\nI live in probably the best country in the world for women. I am _not_ religious. I have never been religious. My country's overall position to abortion is very relaxed and respectful towards the women. The conditions to keep my child as a poor (well, let's be honest, I had no income then, have no income now) woman are the best in the world. We have a fantastic welfare system, free health care, free education. Everything. I saw that a lot on those so called pro-life sites, and have seen them later on. Women who say they are feminist and want the _conditions_ to be so well women don't have to abort. I had those conditions. \n\n\nFrom that day I became pregnant (or let's say, more precisely, that first day when I started to scroll those websites) I have lost my real will to live. That kind of will that makes you dream and enjoy life. That kind of passion where you  _look forward_ to things. Where you are anxious to go to the world and fight for your place in life. Anything can happen, life is so exciting and fun. That was my life before I became pregnant. I had dreams of university, maybe a foreign husband, erasmus, travelling, partying, experiencing.  Learning languages, dancing till the morning, drinking, making friends. \n\n\nThe day before my abortion I had the worst panic attack, my first. After that there has been plenty. I cancelled my abortion the morning of it. I felt enormous relief. \n\n\nLet's be honest about the reasons here: I, a person who was raised in a very non-religious-only-namely-christian household, was convinced I am going to hell if I do this. Yes, you read that right. I would never confess this to anyone else, ever, but I did not keep this baby because I saw a future with her or because I wanted to, I did because I did not see that I could terminate it now. I felt 100% trapped, everything was over. The mistake was already happened, nothing could save me anymore. Either I was going to be a baby-killer or then I was going to have a stupid, boring life. No good options. \n\n\nI am more pro-choice today, as a mother for a very challenging but beautiful almost 2 year old, than ever. I know motherhood now. I know what my life is now when I had this child. I lost myself. I am still not in the university because I can't concentrate on reading for the entrance exam with her. I am trying this year, but it won't happen. I am exhausted. Money is tight and it is _very_ strictly controlled, even though because I live in an awesome country I am not missing anything.\n\n\nMore than anything, life is lonely. My friends are living their own life, no one is a mother. I am the boring, frumpy shell that is nothing like what I used to be. I have strecth marks, my boobs are sagging at 21, I am overweight. I had a very difficult and painful birth that still manifestates itself today in form of me having trouble of holding on farts. I don't use make up anymore, nor do I dress up since I don' have money for clothes and I hate my appearance so much there would be no point anyway. Oh I am sorry, I know that when women become mothers appearance and \"superficial stuff\" don't matter at all since we don't care about anything else than our children's welfare. If we do, it is just to please our husbands. Well, I don't have a husband, and I mourn the loss of my looks very much. It affects my self esteem.\n\n\nI am perfectly aware how society even the most feminist, free countries in the world sees single mothers. I am a fuck up, a mess up, I was \"pumped and dumped\", I deserve this. No good man wants me anymore. I have lost even the boys who used to be my friends, not to mention when my boyfriend left us absolutely no one was interested in me anymore.\n\n\nI spend my days with my little human. I take care of her, I feed her, I bathe her, I play with her, I go to the park with her, I read to her. I am constantly, absolutely constantly, scared of parenting her wrong. I try to learn about parenting methods which I can't seem to really keep up with in real life. \n\n\nNow, let's get to the important part of my mindless, long rambling: **I love her**. With all my heart. I have short times of immense joy with her. My life is for her. I am trying to get into university in a field that would have 9-16 days so I can construct my life around her.  I will fight with everything I have to ensure she has a good life. \n\n\nIf I was sent to that day right now, holding my phone with shaking hands, convinced I have to cancel my abortion, would I still do it? No. I wouldn't. I would abort. \n\n\nPeople don't like extremely complicated answers, answers that actually reflect life that is hard and has a million different view points. They want \"oh not aborting was the most wonderful decision of my life, my child gave me a reason and happiness and everything\". They don't want young women with no realistic opportunities to support themselves without the help of the government to have children, but will judge those who abort.  \n\n\nIf I could, I would go back and abort in a heart beat, actually understanding what it means to stay up alone all by yourself, be left my your boyfriend who has the freedom to just merrily fuck off to his exciting student-life bubble with our old friends. I would understand how taxing the bodily, mental and hormonal changes are. I would understand, than once you have a child _that's it_. Your life is over, or at least put on on hold, and you _never_ get life or those precious years of freedom,  fun, studying and networking back. The reason people make babies in stable marriages is because parenting is FUCKING HARD. It is FUCKING EXHAUSTING. I would give _anything_ in this world to do this when I am significantly older, with a supporting husband, living our on own money, in house. It would be wonderful to have that now, but still it wouldn't be what I really want in life. It would still be a second-place good. \n\n\nI don't need help, or reassuring, or cheering or \"it will be get better when that baby reaches age x\"-thing. Nor I am looking for compassion. I know clear well my post comes off as a selfish, whining bitch. That's how women are seen. We have a motherhood myth, and if you don't fit in you are a monster. I don't need advice or \"why don't you just adopt/quit bitching and enjoy what you have/at least you have a healthy child/most people have it worse\". I don't give a fuck. I know perfectly well I am a good mom and will be a good mom, and I will do everything for her. However I don't like it, I don't like my life. Its lost. \n\n\nI have been to the doctor and yes I am depressed. I don't need \"this is your post natal depression speaking, it will get better when you get sleep, when she is an adult you are grateful for her blah blah, you would be depressed anyway\". I don't believe depression being an illness that just pops out randomly for no reason at all. I am depressed because I hate my life and have no way out, and the reason it is because I hate being a mother. You can reverse every single thing in life except having kids and death. \n\n\n**TL;dr**: Women who are pregnant and thinking whether or not to abort: Do not give a single fuck for _any_ outside opinion. Not the opinion of your boyfriend, or even husband, relative, friend, church member, whatever (I know the husband and boyfriend-part will trigger a massive roar, don't care.) . Look at _your_ life in the future, what you want, and then act accordingly. Keep your child ONLY if you WANT TO BE A MOTHER. Everything else, finances, relationships, people shaming and guilt-tripping you, is bullshit. I am **not** encouraging anyone to abort. I am saying that in the end no one else will be there, and it will be you and only you, with your one, unique life. It needs to be _your_ decision you know you can live with the rest of your life. Those people wanting to influence you are not going to care or help you in the end. \n\n\n\nThe end. \n\n\n**Edit**: I have to go now and it can take me a long time until I get back (I can't be on phone or computer when I am with my kid) , so I am upset I can't answer to each and every post made here, but. Please know that all your positive messages have made a huge impact on me. I am in tears. I shared something painful and instead of a few trolls and ignoring, I got to have so encouraging and beautiful messages and other women sharing their feelings and life situations. I thank all of you for your PMS (except the trolls) and your messages. I will read all of them and try to answer to as much as I can.\n\n\nAnd to that person who gave me gold, I have no words. Just... Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n**Quick edit 2 since this is important**: I would never say to my daughter that she wasn't really wanted,  and I will do everything I can ever to feel the complete opposite. I will never tell her anything what really happened when I considered my options. I've always said to her I loved you since the moment I knew you were coming and that she is my greatest gift, and those things are true. My daughter is the light of my life, and I don't blame her on anything, what I do blame is myself and wish that women could have more support. I know my feelings are more complex than mothers are allowed to have, but to those asking if I hate my daughter that is the last sentiment I have. I will be the best I can for her, and I am sticking to my decision.\n\n\n\n**Edit 3** : Good god I am shaking. I don't understand what is happening here. I am honestly in a state of shock. I thought I would just quickly check this before crashing since I can hardly keep my eyes open, and came back to blown up inbox of hundreds of messages, _four fucking golds_,  this is being in the r/all. I can't wrap my head around what is happening.\n\n\nYour messages. Your private messages. It would be impossible for me to try to put in words how I am feeling right now. It would be too little to say that I am overwhelmed. I have read message after message with my hand covering my mouth since I can't take all these people reaching out to me, telling their stories and sharing how they feel about their situations that are from every perspective of this issue, people sending just LOVE, just lovely, encouraging, loving messages for a complete stranger (and yes so, so many hateful trolls too, btw I don't read further immediately when I spot on a message that was mean simply to hurt). I don't know what to do with all this love. My heart is beating so fast.\n\n\nIt would be absolutely impossible for me to go through all of them right now, it is very late and I have spend much longer on this than I really could. I will read each and every single of them and reply to as many as I possibly can.\n\n\nI can't believe just letting the world see my ugly raw hopelessness and feelings of being trapped could open a gate like this. I dwell on these thoughts hour to hour, day to day alone, month to month, usually when grandma takes my daughter to her so I can have a short break I write to myself in my diary. I can't believe the amount of women reaching out and sharing how they feel. \n\n\nAs I said, I am not religious, but I believe in the universe. But let's just say I've have a _very_ hard couple of months, and _extremely_ hard couple of days, especially this day. i think. I think I was supposed to write this. Something has cracked inside of me, I can't handle my emotions right now but this, this has been more therapeutic than the 7 months I have spent with a professional. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is some kind of turning point for me. I feel it.\n\n\n\nI don't know how to say thank you. Thank you. Just **thank. you**. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I am going to drink about 6 liters of water to hydrate myself after all this crying and then I think I am going to lay down to the bed and be actually able to breath without the heavy feeling of creeping pain and soul-crushing anxiety blocking it. Then I am going to sleep well. For the first time in so long I don't want to write it. I just know it. \n\n\n\nSince I have this one short chance to say how I feel about this and maybe reach out to someone (also because I received so many of those messages of how I promote and encourage abortion), I will repeat this in a shorter way: **Nothing else matters than your own, personal, deep desire and inner voice on choosing what to do. It has to be YOUR choice. Do it ONLY if it TRULY is YOUR choice. Nothing else should do, since nothing else really matters.** Everything and everyone trying to manipulate, influence, bully, shame, or convince you is indifferent. It should go without saying, but since it was confusing to so many people, this applies to those women wanting to keep your baby but feeling that you are too much of x, have too much or too less of x or are being pushed by a partner/parent/important person in your life to abort. That decision _will_ hurt you, greatly.\n\n\nLet's get through this one more time: your marital status, age, education, wealth, what the society and community thinks, your image, how religion/someone from the outside views your decision, every single one of those are not what should be the reason you do what you do. \"But women are struggling to conceive so I should feel lucky, but my married lover wants me to abort, but I have everything I need in life, I am ready\", do not give a single fuck if it goes against your inner voice. If it comes from the outside, it is not yours, and you will have more than a hard time living life that is not yours. If it is, you will find a way to cope with everything and anything that comes along the way, since nothing in life is a greater motivation, source of power than knowing what you are doing comes from you.\n\n\nAnd lastly for those attacking me for bringing up the pro-life propaganda and how much it affected me, being skeptical about how it can get through to someone like me: when you are a confused hadly-an-adult, in a situation that is so panicking you feel like you are in the roof of a burning apartment with no opportunities to save yourself, with a huge hormonal rush, not knowing what to do (or more like thinking you aren't supposed to do what you want to do), you submit to powers you would normally not pay a second to. And I consumed that shit _a lot_. I understand it is hard to understand for an outsider, but when you are in a state of complete vulnerability feeling like it is something too big for you to decide, it is easier to listen to someone who says they know exactly what is right for you even if you know it isn't. They use stuff that cuts down to your emotions and really fucks up your mind.\n\n\nI am not blaming my boyfriend, my internet habits, or anyone outside for my decision. I take full responsibility of what happened. No one forced me with a gun to do anything, even though it felt like it in some way. But just like it was my choice, I should have seen it truly is _only_ my choice and absolutely no one is invested in that I am.\n\n\nAnd that is my goal for women to realize. I belive we are strong together and should celebrate and look out for each other. Womanhood is a beautiful but hard thing and we need to help each other. Thank you, you wonderful ladies and gentlemen. I will get back to all of you soon.\n\n\nThank you for giving me hope, since that is what I got from this. Hope. So much hope. I am now going to bed with a lighter heart I've had in years.",

    "text": "Dear Fellow Pro-lifers; We can't legislate away abortion and why we shouldn't want to. Dear Fellow Prolifers,\n\nI am Pro-life. To me, that means caring not only for unborn children but also the women who feel they have no other choice than to terminate their pregnancy.\n\nThe thought of someone having an abortion tears at my heart. The loss of an innocent life physically hurts me. But this isn’t something new. Abortions have been going on since the dawn of time. We will never be able to reverse legislation that makes it legal. And we shouldn’t want to. We shouldn’t want to go back to a time when desperate women would go into an alley and let someone they didn’t know perform a dangerous procedure on them. \n\nI don’t want that and you shouldn't either. Instead, we should be doing everything possible to make it so that women aren’t forced into that position to begin with.\n\nThat starts with education. We need to support legislation that encourages sex education that teaches our young people about safe sex. Not only to prevent pregnancy but to also prevent the spread of STIs. The idea of abstinence, waiting until someone finds their one true love, is great. It’s what we want for our children. But it didn’t work a hundred years ago and it doesn’t work now. Our self-worth, as women and as people, should never be tied to our sexuality. To tell someone they are worth less because they gave in to temptation, the same temptation probably close to 100% of the adult population gave into before marriage, is disgusting. If, as a parent, it is important to you to teach that to your child, then go ahead. But I, as a Christian, am called to love everyone. Even those who don’t agree with me in my beliefs. And I certainly don’t expect others to follow commands I failed to obey. How many abortions are on our heads? How many abortions have been done because single women were too embarrassed to tell their religious families that they were pregnant outside of marriage? I never want my children to feel like they can’t come to me. I don't want them to be afraid that I would disown them or send them away should I find out they had sex outside of marriage. It’s preposterous. We need to stop holding others to a higher standard.\n\nNext, we need to fight for legislation that provides free or low-cost contraception to anyone who asks. If everyone having sex knows about contraception and can go to the pharmacy or the local clinic or their doctor’s office and get it, imagine how much it would reduce the number of abortions in this country. This includes the sixteen-year-old high school student that wants an IUD, the thirty-year-old mom that wants an implant, and the forty-year-old homeless man in need of condoms. And I am including the morning after pill in this, because that is NOT an abortion, and people need to stop acting like it is. All the morning after pill does is makes the uterus inhospitable so that the fertilized egg doesn’t attach. I would rather this than have a woman wait six weeks to find out she’s pregnant and then have an abortion. \n\nWe need to stand together, whether pro-life or pro-choice and find our common ground. We need to fight so that abortion is so rare that it’s no longer a division between us. We are women, we are strong, and we can do this!",

    "text": "Boyfriend wanted an abortion, so I got one. Less than a week later he runs to his parents and tells them i got an abortion against his will. Then he told my extremely conservative family, all of this without my consent. What can I do? This all started weeks ago when I found out I was pregnant. My (now ex)boyfriend has a severe anxiety disorder where he shakes contantly under pressure, has episodes that look and feel like heart attacks and has to go to the hospital frequently because of it. He's from an extremely religious background, and this is his first adult relationship (he is 27, I am 26 and we've known each other well over a decade. He was a virgin until age 26 by choice, and I was his first partner.. I am not religious so he was not my first). He has a very close relationship with his family; many/most would say TOO close. \n\nAnyways, he told me that if we had the baby, he would most likely die of a heart attack because according to his doctor, if he didnt remove stress from his life he will eventually have a fatal heart attack. He said if it was up to him, he would choose to have the abortion, but that its completely my choice and he would just try to find a life insurance policy to take care of me and the baby. To me that's not a choice or an option. Either my partner dies or i get an abortion? A life for a life is not a choice. He told me not to worry, that in 2 to 3 years we could have a baby and everything would be fine. So I decided to abort, despite my hesitation and constant emotional breakdowns because of it. We decided mutually to keep it a secret from our extremely conservative and overbearing families.\n\nFast forward 5 days after the abortion. SO asks me to marry him and Im filled with joy and hope and elation. We were passionately in love and he had spent most of his time sitting with me while I recovered. Then the next day he told me he needed alone time. The day after that he said he thought I was having over the top emotional reactions (no kidding, after a stressful pregnancy, unwanted abortion, and first week of birth control?). He said these reactions were unfair to him, but Ive never raised my voice or insulted him. I was just crying a lot and Ill admit it, being very needy. \nSo he approached some friends for \"counsel,\" told them everything EXCEPT  the pregnancy/abortion and they told him I was being emotionally abusive and to stop talking to me immediately. So he did. And told me he was going to tell his parents about the abortion. Then ghosted.\n\nNext thing I hear is hours later from my mother, saying he had met up with his father and my stepdad to tell them that I had an abortion. And that he never wanted one and had asked me to keep the baby and that I had decided this against his wishes. He broke up with me through our parents, as a grown-ass man, and refused to talk to me until the next day. When we met up the next day, he wouldnt let me into his apartment to get my things. When we talked he showed zero emotion or remorse. It was truly disturbing. Like talking to a shell of a human. Within one day, everything changed. I feel dizzy and betrayed and abandoned. I guess i just need to vent about all this. What can I do in this situation? I had trust issues before, and I dont know how I can come back from this.\n\nI need help (edit-- any recources to cheap or free therapy i could find? I feel an immense amount of grief about this abortion and the aftermath and I feel like I cant handle it on my own.)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHANK YOU for all of your sentiments and support. I've read through every comment and it helps so much to be affirmed that this is in fact not normal behavior. (I've been through many abusive relationships and have a hard time assessing what is \"acceptable\" behavior or not.) \n As an update/correction to the above, while he did not allow me into his house at first, when I brought my best friend (and mutual friend of his) with me, he allowed us in. He didnt want me in his house \"without a witness\" (his exact words). We ended up talking, and he really believes that what he did was the right thing. He really believes he's a victim. And thats all he would say, that he offered to die for me and the baby but i just wouldnt let him. My friend told him how abusive this was, and how fucked it was of him to do. He had multiple conversations with her in the past in which he stated he wanted an abortion. And when she asked him if he remembered that, he just stared blankly. So clearly mental illness is at play here. It was like he was dissociating. \n\nAlso just to be clear, my family has been shockingly supportivr through all of this. They believe me and are actually relieved that this happened now and not later, which blows my mind because my mother is clinic-protester level conservative. So all is sort of well on that front.\n\n I know this isnt my fault, and that I need to just look ahead and never backwards. Will be hard because hes been my close friend since middle school. But I know Ive been through some crazy abusive shit in the past, and have always recovered after time... This just feels like the ultimate betrayal and I'll be checking out all the sources you all left to go to therapy. Thanks! It has helped me immensely to read all of this confirmation and support.",

    "text": "In 7 hours I went from \"bad period cramps\" to pregnant to emergency surgery and a lost baby. Trying to process. Hey there, I didn't know where else to post this so here I am ladies!\n\nSince Tuesday I had been having terrible cramping, everybody told me it was period cramps so I tried to ride it out. \n\nYesterday I just had a bad feeling about it and went to the ER around noon. They did some blood work and told me I was pregnant, to which I responded \"shut the fuck up\". I'm a single mom and definitely wasn't trying for this. I have a friend with benefits (let's call him Tom) that I've been hooking up with so it was obviously his. I panicked. \n\nThey then did an ultrasound and the ER doctor told me it was ectopic pregnancy, and my tube had burst which explained the pain and bloating I was feeling. I was bleeding heavily and they needed to operate immediately. \n\nFrom there it became a rush to make sure I didn't crash, and to get me in the OR as soon as possible. They told me they were pushing to get me to the front because everything could go from stable to bad very quickly. It was terrifying. I cried a lot just from the rush of all the information. \n\nWithin 7 hours of checking into the ER I was being discharged. Now I'm home. And just feeling a bit numb from it all. I have a very dark sense of humor so I joked with Tom that the baby was trying to kill me and stuff. But it's hit me hard now that it was a baby, my baby, and it's gone. And that's been really hard to process. I didn't even know I was pregnant 24 hours ago. \n\nI don't know if we would have kept it, neither of us are in a position to have a child, much less together, but I feel robbed of that choice and that's hard to cope with. And to make matters worse Tom is the kind of man who shuts down when he gets stressed and overwhelmed, so he's totally gone dark on me. He keeps saying all that matters is that I'm okay and how I'm doing, but I know that this was also his baby too. I feel like I robbed him of something. \n\nSorry this is so ramble-ey. Just the rush of finding out I'm pregnant, then finding out I'm not, then the fear of surgery and trying to come to terms with the potential (even though it was small) of things going wrong and not waking up again. It's been a crazy 24 hours. And now I just feel alone. \n\nThis probably sounds stupid, but i feel this desire to mourn the baby, and I don't even know where to begin. \n\nThanks for listening ladies. I just needed to get it out. \n\nTL;DR feeling crippling isolation after a surprise ectopic pregnancy that burst my tube and undergoing emergency surgery, all in a 7 hour period. \n\nEdit: this got way more responses than I expected. I'm overwhelmed by the love and support I feel from you all. Thank you so so much. This has been such an isolating experience and you lovely strangers have helped me find so much more peace and solace than I thought possible. I can't thank you enough. \n\nI'm going to definitely focus on taking care of and loving myself. Every part of that night was a rush of emotions, from finding out I'm pregnant, to finding out it's not a viable pregnancy, even the whole coming to terms with the fact that I was being put under and something could go wrong and I may never wake up. And I need to cope with it, all of it. \n\nFor now I'm just so thankful to be alive, and home. And everything after that is just a blessing. Whatever happens to my friendship with Tom, it's okay. I will heal with or without him. \n\nThank you again everybody. You don't know how much your messages and comments have meant to me.",

    "text": "Why do people practice medicine like this? 60 something year-old man is brought to the ER by his family with 3 hour history of worsening left arm weakness. He had a CVA after CEA at OSH 10 days ago. His stroke was not treated at that time. His imaging from that hospital stay were transferred from the OSH. As soon as he hits the ER, he gets a head CT, CTA head. Orders are also put in for an MRI head, before any of the aforementioned exams were even completed. No physician has evaluated him yet, but both CT exams are performed. I read both. Remote right frontal infarct reidentified, along with two sub-acute infarcts that were already known about. No other significant finding. About 23 minutes after he leaves the scanner -not exaggerating- three additional requests are made: 1. Non-con CT head, 2. CTA head, CTA chest. I call the NP who put orders in (still no physician has evaluated him). She says he \"crumped\", requiring intubation. Said she needed to rule out new stroke, bleed, etc, as well as PE. I asked her if she really thought that in the last 23 minutes since his last exam he had a new infarct, hemorrhaged, or threw a PE!! And if she could maybe decide which of the three it might more likely be. She can't say, but she's sure it's one or the other (WTF?). Anyway we do all three exams.  All negative except for the aforementioned  strokes, no significant interval change in 23 minutes (surprise!). \n\nThis shit is the reason the medical system in the United States will crumble. The complete lack of clinical judgement, blatant disregard for costs, and unwillingness/inability to apply even a little common sense. Occam's razor goes a long way in solving most problems.  This one patient was imaged a total of 8 times in the emergency department tonight alone, and probably will get an MRI overnight. On top of god knows how much imaging related to his surgery and strokes at OSH. \n\nCan anyone tell me why people abuse radiology so much? I'm not crying - I don't mind reading the extra scans they're often basically normal or unchanged from the recent comparison which was also unjustified. But seriously what is the reason that doctors don't sack up and practice medicine without the crutch of a having a radiologist tell them what they already know?",

    "text": "UPDATE: How does a doctor married to a surgeon make it work? Having a lot of trouble these days. Original post:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/55b04m/how_does_a_doctor_married_to_a_surgeon_make_it/\n\nFigured I'd update given the surprising interest in the topic.\n\nSo as it often happens - things got worst before they got better-ish. My partner decided to take on even more duties, deciding to become involved in teaching. He would now come home from work and be making powerpoint presentations and stressing over interactive cases for medical students. I continued to feel lonely and isolated - I'm one of the few female anesthetists at my institution so finding girl friends has been really hard. I've tried to maintain my hobbies, but at some point, you get tired of being alone all day.\n\nFinally, I hit my last straw - we had a huge falling out one Friday night about a month ago and I ended up spewing all my feelings and then some. I had planned to sit down and discuss my concerns with him in a calm and reasonable manner but that all fell out the window. I ended up asking him to stay with a friend for the weekend, as I was just too upset and didn't trust myself to not further antagonize the issue.\n\nAfter the weekend apart, we both cooled down and sat down and had a reasonable discussion. He agreed he was taking on too much, but he also felt like he had no other choice, as this seems to be the expected status quo among his peers. After lots and lots of talking, he agreed he'd sit down with his supervisors and see if he could at least drop the graduate degree he was pursuing. \n\nIt was a step in the right direction - he's put his grad work on hold for now, but has replaced some of that free time with medical education pursuits. His justification is that to work in an academic centre as an orthopod, he needs all the advantages he can get. I can see that it does make him happy - he was inspired by a great mentor and wants to pay it forward to students and I find this admirable.\n\nWe've instituted mandatory date nights and that's really helped. I've also joined some classes and clubs to expand my own social circle - I definitely feel like over the years, I've become dependant on medicine to provide me with all my sources of entertainment, including a pre-made social circle, so I'm trying to move beyond that. So there's improvement and I think that's all I can ask for at this point!\n\nEarlier this month, he stared hinting at marriage - just comments like \"oh that would be a nice place to get married\" or \"we could take our honeymoon when I finish X project\" . It's been in the conversation before and I think we both knew the relationship was heading there. Part of me wonders, rather naively I'm sure, if this is a sign of his commitment to further working on the relationship - I have always said that I wanted to get married once we'd \"settled in\" to our careers and I wonder if he's hinting that he's nearing that point? Another part of me wonders if its terrible timing - almost an appeasement to my unhappiness? I've had these discussions with him, but I find I always come out of the conversation still unsure of how I feel. There is no question I love the man, just not sure how this would work with kids and marriage! \n\nAt the end of the day, if I can offer any piece of advice to those married to a surgeon - be prepared to have it take over your life too in some ways. In anesthesia, my colleagues and I will always say how we love being in the OR but are so happy we're not surgeons - but being married to one means you still get the surgery lifestyle encroaching on your own! I love my partner and that makes it worth it but it presents a unique set of challenges that doesn't just disappear once residency is done!",

In the med school I am associated with, it's the second trainee suicide this year (earlier was a student, and now a recent graduate)\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here. I think I already have a pretty good feel for what we're doing wrong. Anyone who's seen a colleague, especially a trainee, suffering from depression and needing help knows full well how the gossip goes. I'm sick to death of having to defend trainees who need time or help, to associates who can't seem to understand that needing help isn't weakness and taking time to recover from illness doesn't impact your ability to practice.\n\nWe can be bad even about organic illness, but in residency I had two health problems. One was organic, and I had a single minor hiccup in getting it dealt with. The other was mental health (postpartum depression) and I had to skirt close to legally threatening a preceptor who found out and seemed to think it was somehow not just her right but her duty to report a transient health issue to the residency program (despite it having been resolved a few months earlier, when I sought and got appropriate help during my parental leave).\n\nWe suck at this. If anyone has any insight into how to make us suck less, I'd love to hear it. I'll bring it up to those who might be willing to listen after the losses we've suffered.\n\nGonna miss you man. You were an amazing doctor, a good man, and it should have been you explaining the medical details of family tragedies to your sister.

Hey Medicine,\n I want to use a throwaway because I feel a bit ashamed.\n\nI'm a junior doctor.\n\nRecently a member of my family passed away who I was very close too. It wasn't a surprise to me, he was old and unwell and I have seen the decline he went through in many patients over my time studying and working.\n\nI'm worried because I haven't really felt the grief that I've felt in similar situations before I did medicine. I haven't cried, I haven't really felt bad. In fact I've felt a kind of contentment because in my experience the way this man died was actually quite lovely, with his children around him, relatively quickly, without pain and without loosing his mind.\n\nI guess I often worry whether I'm a bit of a psychopath, I need to empathize daily patients, I wonder whether I actually just fake my emotions.\n\nWhat do you think? Has anyone been through a similar thing?\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for leaving your lovely messages. I'm feeling a lot more normal now. Thank you.",

    "text": "Can I open a practice that only bills Workman's Comp for new cases with established patients of mine? Or is taking WC all-or-nothing? I'm planning on opening a direct primary care (DPC) practice that is subscription fee for service, and does not take insurance, private or government. I plan to formally opt out of Medicare. Think what you will of my choice, but I am not here to debate or defend it today. If you can't get past this choice of mine, please don't reply.\n\nI have a problem with Workman's Compensation, but not totally. I think such a thing should exist, and if an established patient of mind happens to suffer legitimate and demonstrable injury on their job, I'm not against billing and documenting for WC. My problem is with patients establishing care with me and bringing an old WC case with them, especially if this is one of their main or only reasons for establishing with me as their PCP. I've been burned, and burned up, by a number of these cases. By the time the patient is putting WC forms in front of me to sign, it's often far from clear to me how disabled and unable to work they currently are, or ever were. Some people who simply don't want to work anymore benefit from and maximize this obfuscation. Even if their claim to disability is (or was) legit, the fact that they're picking a new PCP who wasn't there when everything went down raises an eyebrow. I know that if I was legitimately injured and disabled on the job and claimed WC benefits, and had a caring PCP who'd been with me since I first made the claim, I'd stick with him/her at all costs. I'd *maximize* continuity of care, and if something like a move made this impractical, I'd have my paperwork in order to make it as easy and clear to my new PCP what went down.\n\nOne of the cases I dealt with which finally made me leave my most recent job involved a patient with an old WC claim, where he'd hopped around between PCPs for the whole case. Clearing up the ambiguity in his case would have required hours and hours of reading over old notes and making calls to old doctors of his. As if this wasn't enough, the patient was not at all clear in communicating his wishes or reasons for establishing care with me, and was just a nasty, angry man in general. I ended up filling out a disability insurance form for him which indicated he was good to work, which from my H&P on him didn't seem wrong at the time. This ended up derailing a whole lawsuit he had going against WC, and he raised hell with me and my practice. I'm amazed he didn't sue me. Factoring in the time and sweat equity I spent trying to fix this situation, I don't think I made minimum wage on his case. As if that wasn't enough, my practice was angry with me for the hell that came their way from this patient, and basically told me, \"Stop not giving our paying customers what they're looking for!\" I decided right then and there: eff Workman's Comp. Or at the very least, eff taking on old WC cases.\n\nMy question is, can I make it a policy at my new practice that I will not bill WC for old cases I didn't originally help them file, but I am willing help established patients of mine file new ones? Or does being willing to bill and document for WC bind me to some obligation to take old cases that come to me for help? If there's a chance I might run afoul of WC's rules, I may just decide to say that I don't bill WC at all.",

    "text": "Legal Torture Part of being an ICU nurse is having to discuss the dirty acronym 'DNR' but to me, it's not dirty, it is freeing. Before I became a nurse, I never would have thought that telling the doctors and nurses taking care of my sweet family member to stop saving their life could be a good thing.\n\nIt's never an easy decision, but a necessary one.\n\nToday I took care of the man in room 5. Before his surgery, he was an active man, former military. He has many grown children. He came into the hospital over 90 days ago with a large aortic aneurysm. During surgery, they found that the old stent in his aorta from a previous surgery had slipped down and occluded blood flow to his two renal arteries. His kidneys were basically dead. They also found that due to other complications, his gut was dead and infected. The family was updated on his poor prognosis. The surgeon brought up to the family the need to discuss stopping life saving measures. The devastated family of this sweet man were outraged and said that is not going to happen.\n\nHe was transferred to room 2 in CVICU and 3 days later, he coded four times in one day.\n\nThis poor man is essentially brain dead now. He breathes through his trached ventilator. He does not make any urine, but gets dialysis every other day. He's on several blood pressure drips that are very harmful to your arteries and veins. He has infection all over his body. His skin looks like it is rotting off. He has 4+ pitting edema because his kidneys aren't filtering any fluids or toxins, so if his blood pressure isn't stable enough for dialysis one day and he misses, his tissues become invaded with all the fluid his vessels can't hold.\n\nWith each breath, his whole head moves to the side, his ribs retract and his belly bounces.\n\nEvery shift, the nurses have to change his countless dressings. He has pressure wounds and shear tears all over his body. Not from negligence, but a sign from his body that he is falling apart.\n\nThe neurologist says it's unclear whether or not he can hear us or feel pain.\n\nHe's been in this room for way too long. 90% of which he has been like this. His family still refuses to make him a DNR or \"Do Not Resucitate\"\n\nThey think there is some kind of chance we can fix him even though we have exhausted every possible measure.\n\nThis is my third day in a row to have this man and it's painful to even walk in the room. The family hasn't even come to see him in a week.\n\nHe starts coughing so I begin to in-line deep suction him through his tracheostomy. Blood comes through the suction line. I look to his face and see tears rolling down his expressionless face. \"I'm so, so sorry..\" I tell him every time I have to suction him.\n\nHe smells awful. I've already bathed him, cleansed all his wounds and changed his dressings. It is a smell of the overwhelming infection that has taken over his body that the IV antibiotics cannot fight fast enough. Another nurse and I turn him to the side and my hand presses into his skin like play-dough and my hand impression stays there for several minutes. I take off the dressing on his bottom and his fragile, thin skin tears off with the tape. The other nurse pets his head. The neurologist said it's unclear if he can feel pain, but I've taken care of him so long, and I think he can.\n\nAnytime a doctor, nurse, or even janitor comes into room 2 with me, it is never our usual chit-chat. It is a solemn silence only interrupted by need-to-know information.\n\nThis is what legal torture looks, feels, and smells like.\n\nPlease, tell your family your wishes or make an advance directive outlining your wishes regarding end of life.\n\nMaking someone a DNR is hard, but it frees them of the tortures of life saving measures.",

    "text": "I did it - story of the ultimate con That's it boys, I realized my kid's dream. As someone pointed out in this very sub a couple hours ago, there are not many place where you can brag about such achievements, so here is my story of how I made Google believe I am a skilled software engineer.\n\n**Why?**\n\nI have always loved programming, but when I was a student I thought it was for losers, and I wanted to learn physics. Physics is great, I don't exactly regret learning it I spent a great time at my university. But when I worked on my PhD I realized that research is boring and that I hate being a scientist, I am an engineer. I also realized that programming is the best engineering activity there is, with the fastest feedback loop possible, you can build awesome things incredibly fast. And I was in love with Google's philosophy (granted it was 15 years ago, but I still believe there is such a thing). So I switched to programming as a professional activity.\n\n**Learning how to code**\nI thought I knew how to code, I found a job very quickly and they asked me to write programs on my own. I did, it was not bad, but mostly I was pretending, spending half my day on Google/Stackoverflow, reading books. The best thing that happened to me was when a real programmer joined my team, showed me how to use SVN, how to write templates in C++, how to remove all the comment and replace it wit readable code. I spent 2 years in my first company, but unfortunately I did good and was promoted to project manager, which is a terrible job and I quit a few month after that.\n\n**Learning how to code, again**\nI spent 6 years in a research laboratory, officially doing electrical engineer things, but I chose to do only software. That's the kind of deceptive human being I am, and they fell for it. I made robots talk to each other, camera stitch their environments, I helped medical doctors use the algorithms written by real doctors. And I learned a lot, I read many books, I followed courses on MIT Opencourseware, on youtube, on Coursera.\n\n**The bait**\nEvery year, I participated to Google's codejam. The first time I didn't manage to go passed the qualification round, but I went on and trained and improved my competing skills, now I can confidently go the the round 2 although I never made it to round 3 (and probably never will). This is how their recruiter got my number. \n\n**The recruitment**\n4 years ago they asked me if I would be interested to join Google. I was absolutely not prepared and I declined, but that made me think that I would really want to work in the industry. So I started applying here and there in real tech companies. I was almost hired a couple time, declined a couple offers that I couldn't accept for financial/family reasons, and 2 years later Google contacted me again. This time I accepted, bought CTCI and Elements of Programming Interview (this one is far superior in my bragging opinion), spent 2 hours per day practicing interview questions, and passed my first round of real interviews at Google. Thatb went well, but eventually they had difficulty finding a team for me, especially given the fact that I am obviously not a software engineer since I never worked as such, and I was rejected by the VP board (the last stage of their recruitment process).\n\n**Joining the industry**\nI finally managed to find a job in the tech industry. This past year, I have been working with awesome software developers, in a great startup, building an amazing product where I am doing image processing stuff and machine learning computation and all that. I learned a lot, again. This thing is endless, it seems.\n\n**Second interview**\nIn January I asked my recruiter at Google if I could reapply. She kindly accepted, and I went through the process again. You know the drill: Whiteboard, whiteboard, whiteboard, and some more whiteboard. I know the drill. Nailed it. This time with my small but significant experience in the tech world, I had no trouble finding a team. They sent me an offer. I fooled them, they really believe I am a talented software engineer. This was a long con. It was not easy, but man it was fun. I can't wait to join their team and see how much I have to learn still, and how long it takes them to realize.",

    "text": "Semi-complicated question about getting into a CS career without a typical HS diploma This question is going to have to involve a lot of background, so prepare for quite a bit of text.\n\n**TL;DR: Life keeps throwing me curveballs, and despite stellar grades I'm two years behind for graduation. Is it possible/feasible to get a career in software development without a formal high school diploma? If so, how would I go about pursuing that?**\n\nI'm 18 years old, and I want to go into a tech job. While I'm not entirely picky on what specifically I go into, I know I am both good at and genuinely enjoy programming- my stepdad raised me, and seeing as he's a software developer I grew up with exposure to it, at age 10 or so I was already studying Python to learn some basic logic.\n\nUnfortunately, around age 12 my parents separated, and since then my life has seemed determined to screw itself up as much as universally possible. I'm now considering dropping out- not to give up and work a minimum wage job, but as a genuine option.\n\nBasically, I have had issues with public schools and the general American education system since 1st grade. I have ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and while I am plenty intelligent and capable, my brain doesn't do well with environments that most kids would've flourished in, and until I learned how to successfully imitate normal socialization, the other kids thought I was a bit odd. I switched schools at the end of 2nd grade. Then again at the end of 3rd. Then again, at the end of 4th, and 5th, and 7th, and 8th. Keep in mind, my issues have never been grades. I'm a straight-A, honor roll student. The issue for me was bullying and the general school environment- in 5th grade, I threatened suicide if my parents made me go back, and to this day I have nightmares about the bullying I went through and the way the administration handled it. (I didn't go back, incidentally- I finished 5th grade through independent study, and then 6th and 7th were completed through online homeschooling.)\n\nIn high school, I was doing okay for a record amount of time- 9th grade went amazingly, and about half of 10th did as well. Then, of course, because I was doing so well emotionally, my physical health had to fail. I spent the remainder of 10th grade in and out of the hospital, and was held back. It took about 2-3 years to figure out what was wrong with me and fix it- the anti-depressants I was on were making my body sick from serotonin overdose, and of course coming off of them gave me suicidal depression due to some major chemical issues in my brain.\n\nDuring that time, the school administration sucked. They tried suing me for truancy- yes, I was definitely skipping school so I could go hang in the hospital with IV lines. Super fun time, 2 kool 4 skool man!! Eventually, when we got a legal letter from the doctor saying I was NOT skipping school (Apparently, the dozens of doctor's notes were not good enough), they funneled me into the Florida Virtual School program. Uh, yeah, even kids who aren't chronically ill can't pass that program- the curriculum is notoriously horrible. I was in all AP classes prior to getting sick, and even I could not handle that workload. So, I got held back. I was now 1 year behind.\n\nNext year. We finally pulled enough teeth from the school board to get me into the Hospital Homebound program. This is supposed to be an independent study program like the one I did in 5th grade- but oh, no. This was just virtual school again, but with a tutor sent once a week to assist me. I worked like crazy, and managed to pass the year after working through weekends, breaks, holidays, and the summer. I didn't even finish all the material- the school board just gave me credits after the tutor attested to exactly how hard I was working.\n\nThe school board continued to give me issues repeatedly, the meanwhile I was working on how to combat my depression without Zoloft- to date, I've been on at least 5 different medications, have been hospitalized so many times that people raise their eyebrows at me when I can't remember the exact number, and have been seeing a therapist for a VERY long time. I'm considered a 10th grader by the school system, however I am in 11th grade classes, and am set to graduate in 2019... my original graduation date should've already happened, in this past May. All my friends from freshman year are now in college.\n\nI have tried every single option the district has offered. Partial schedule, where I go in for a few classes a day. Virtual school. They won't provide Hospital Homebound to me since I'm not considered incapacitated enough for it anymore, even if I wanted to go through that again.\n\nCurrently I'm about halfway through the equivalent of my junior year, and it's miserable. I sit through 5 classes a day, and every single one of them feels useless. I'm in honors, but I still finish about 30-40 minutes before everyone else does, leaving me to sit there and stew in my thoughts, not being allowed out of class to do anything more productive. Due to diagnosed PTSD from all the crap I went through with school as a kid and my autism-related anxiety when I don't have anything to do, over half of every day I'm in school ends in a meltdown. You know that meme, autistic screeching? Well, I don't scream, but I end up leaving class and sit in a guidance office for about half of every day crying and unable to physically get myself to speak more than a couple sentences out loud.\n\nTeachers refuse to read my 504, guidance refuses to listen when I say no, I can't go to class right now unless you do want me literally screaming under a desk. I was sent to a mental hospital during one of these incidents- they literally dropped me in with a bunch of suicidal kids, and I was there for 24 hours in living hell (Florida youth mental healthcare is NOT beneficial- it's more like a prison) before a psychiatrist finally realized I didn't need to be there.\n\nI do not think I'll be able to continue like this for another year and a half. I'm not learning anything, I'm sitting there listening to a teacher lecture me on things for an hour that'd take me 15 minutes to learn on my own on places like khanacademy. If I dropped out today, I am completely confident I would be able to study for and pass a GED test by the end of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nI've done lots of research, but unfortunately most of what I find focuses more on a lack of a college degree than a high school diploma- from what I have gathered, it is entirely feasible to get hired without a degree if you build a portfolio, which is what I am currently working on. But next to nothing has any real information on dropping out of high school.\n\nI want to do something with my life, and that's not happening right now. I'm taking mindless tests and writing mindless essays that don't feel like they're benefiting me aside from getting me baby-steps closer to a piece of paper. I want a job, I want to get to doing what I have a passion for. The only reason I'm still in school is for that piece of paper, but if I don't truly, absolutely need it, then I am wasting my time and going through hell for nothing.\n\nSo- is dropping out a real option for me? Does anyone have any recommendations on how to move forward and get a career, if so?",

    "text": "Software dev vs. ABET Software eng before I get too committed. Here's my situation. I'm two years away from graduating with a software development degree from Champlain online. It's fairly reputable in the cybersecurity realm if nothing else. It is a private non-profit that is regionally accredited (i.e., not a diploma mill). The degree program itself is newer and seems to focus on preparing graduates to be project managers for software projects because it has quite a few accounting and management classes.\n\nI have a couple of concerns\n1. What makes a company want to hire me over a programmer that has been with them a while and shown some leadership experience?\n2. Is 'software development' a poor man's software engineering? Would I be better off transferring to Arizona State's ABET accredited program? Or is this degree the health care management of the software world, where those specialists have replaced senior doctors in management?\n\nLooking at the curricula, the software engineering degree has a large focus on high level math instead of the (more practical?) project management/business courses.\n\nMy situation forces me to go online as I have an unrelated career that is geographically isolated where I do programming to make my shop's job easier but it's not a primary duty I could claim tons of experience from.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "text": "so i just got let go... EDIT - this post ended up being pretty long so let me summarize up here. I have 5 questions.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n1. Would it make sense to go back to Corporate Accounting for a year or two to strengthen my Accounting skills, in order to do better as a Financial Analyst in FP&A?  \n2. Can anyone recommend a few accounting courses, ideally free MOOC courses, though it doesn't have to be restricted to that?  \n3. As a CMA I've never done auditing. How valuable is that? Can I learn some important skills just by an auditing course? Can anyone recommend one? I haven't been able to find one.  \n4. This isn't the first time I've been fired and part of me suspects there's something else going on. I do have ADD and a doc for that, but haven't made any progress with that. Might there be other things at play?  \n5. Are there any kinds of Accounting simulations / real world courses I can take, that might help me do better at work? Courses in university teach basic skills but there's very little similarity to what is actually done at work, such as learning new reports and using advanced Excel skills.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Text:\n\n&nbsp;  \nTo start off with I'm a CMA in Canada with about 6 years experience.\n\n&nbsp;  \nI just got let go from my job as a Financial Analyst. Sucks man! What to do. It was on pretty good terms thankfully. My boss told me I'm very dedicated to my role and there's no personality conflict with anyone. I just don't have the solid foundation for this role.\n\n&nbsp;  \nI'm not clear as to how she came to that conclusion but one of the things she mentioned was that I don't seem very clear on what accruals are. I do actually know what they are, but in her defense, I didn't know the concept until about 15 months ago when I was working as a Senior Financial Analyst. I dont know how I got through the previous years without it coming up but it never did. And I dont know what I dont know, so I never knew there was a gap. Not sure what the CMA program is doing wrong and what other skills I'm missing.\n\n&nbsp;  \nNow my boss suggested that I take a job that's a few positions lower and get more comfortable with corporate accounting duties, journal entries etc etc. I'm thinking of doing that but I did want to also ask if that actually would make sense? My last few roles have been FP&A roles and I don't know that Corporate Accounting jobs would actually make me a stronger Analyst. I realize the initial assumption is that of course it would, which I assumed as well. But upon second thought I don't know that it would. Can anyone share their thoughts?\n\n&nbsp;  \nAlso, I should probably take a few courses to make sure I know everything I need to know. I have no intention of doing an entire designation again. But I wonder if there's a few courses I can take (ideally free MOOC courses) that might cover most of what I'd need to know. I find that 90% of one's education never comes up at work so I don't think its unrealistic that a few courses might cover most of what I need.\n\n&nbsp;  \nAs a CMA I've never done auditing. I hear its a shit job; but I've often wondered how valuable it is? In my mind it would be very helpful but I really dont know. If it is, would a course be helpful in it? I don't see how I can get a job in it since I have no experience whatsoever in it.\n\n&nbsp;  \nThis is not the first time I've been let go so a big part of me suspects this isn't actually a lack of experience / basic accounting skills as something else that's 'wrong'. I'm not sure what that is. I do think I'm pretty smart all told but I do sometimes find myself not grasping something as well as others might. I do have ADD and have a doctor for that but it's been fairly pointless as none of the meds have helped. I dont know what advice I could get on this on an Accounting subreddit but if anyone does have some thoughts they could share on this I'd be grateful. \n\n&nbsp;  \nAnd lastly I wanted to ask - are there any kinda classes / courses / seminars that might have real world accounting simulations? University accounting courses as fine for teaching the underlying principles but there's very little similarity between that and the real world. At work it's more like using Excel, creating or working within a report that I've never seen before, doing an assignment on that. Are there any such simulations of what someone might ask for in the real-world, maybe something that would simulate what the first week or two in a new job might be like?\n\n&nbsp;  \nSorry for the wall of text! I know I asked a lot of questions here. Would be grateful for any advice as I keep stumbling here and I need to figure out what the hell to do about my career.\n\nThanks guys!",

    "text": "My wife was charged with assault today. And forcible confinement. I put up with the abuse for around 5 years.  She has provoked me into physically defending myself more than once andd it paralyzed me with fear that she could convince the authorities that I was the aggressor.  \n\nThings of course escalated over time, being undealt with.  She started threatening to call the cops\n\nWhat broke the camels back is over mothers day weekend she started drinking and called our daughter an \"attention whore\" within earshot.  Our daughter is 4 and my angel, my pride and joy.  I told her to go fuck herself and went to the shed, then a few minutes later went in to grab a beer and then go sit outside to cool off.  She went ballistic that I took another beer and ended up pushing me and biting me with our daughter in my arms.  \n\nI went to the hospital earlier today to have them look at a bite mark she left on me and to report the incident.  The FEMALE doctor said \"that's assault you know,  you should consider contacting the police. My husband is an officer\".   I ask her - wouldn't be just be my word against hers?  She says \"No, I've seen it and the police will take pictures.  The police will make a judgement call.\"   I then went to the police and showed them the bite and that she was blocking me from leaving the house and ended up shoving and biting me.  \n\nLong story short guys - Don't hesitate to contact the police if you have been assaulted.  Even if you've just been FORCIBLY CONFINED, contact the police.  It is illegal to block someone in a room and not let them leave.  This evokes your right to physically defend yourself, meaning you have the right to push them out of the door to get out, within reason.  You can't purposefully cause injury but you most certain can push them back out of the way and even restrain them if they start assaulting you for trying to escape.  Assault simply means pushing, shoving, body-blocking, etc.  Anything a man would never get away with towards a woman really does apply to us also.   YOU MUST CONTACT THE POLICE FIRST.  The female doctor said I should before the situation gets redirected back on me - because if your abuser contacts the police first because they feel you are about to report them,  you could very well be the one in handcuffs instead of them. \n\nedit: a word",

    "text": "Feminists oppose men's sexual freedom This web site is named the Campaign Against Sex Robots, but its title should be the Campaign Against Men's Sexual Freedom.  Companies like Real Doll have for years sold realistic looking sex dolls for men (and some women) who want an alternative to the real thing.  They're essentially high-end sex toys.  Now Real Doll, and several other companies, are at work creating sex robots, which will essentially be animated versions of the silicon sex dolls.  They're not for everyone.  Some people will find that strange, but for some people it may be the only sex or companionship they can get.  Other people who have sex lives might want such a toy to enhance their sex lives.  Maybe a guy has a girlfriend and has always fantasized about a threesome.  A sex robot could provide that without the risk of including another actual person.  The bottom line is if a sexual activity does not force any person to do anything against their will, then it's their business and no one else's.  \n\nHowever, the Campaign Against Sex Robots opposes a man's right to make such a choice, even though his doing so hurts no one else.  They make absurd arguments against sex robots.  They claim that the use of sex robots will turn men into rapists.  It's the same old tired refrain we keep getting from feminist hate groups: Everything is rape.  It's not clear from their arguments if they think that using a sex robot will cause a man to go out and rape a real woman or if they think the robot is getting raped.  First of all, women have used dildoes for decades and they've never caused a woman to go out and rape any man, woman, or child.  Sex robots, as high-end sexual enhancers, will not cause men to do that either.  And it's not possible to rape a robot.  The robot is not a sentient being any more than a dildo is.  \n\nThe truth is that feminists simply hate male heterosexuality.  They've bitched for years over what is totally involuntary about male sexuality: That men prefer young and beautiful women.  That's just the way evolution has made human biology.  You could not change that any more than you could change the rings of Saturn.  You'll have about as much success changing that as religion fanatics have converting gays to being straight.  The irony is religion fanatics are hostile toward male homosexuality while feminists are hostile toward male heterosexuality.  \n\nFeminists hate men who go out socializing trying to find a girlfriend.  Supposedly, it's sexist or feeling “entitled to sex” to look for a girlfriend and ask for a woman's phone number.  \n\nFeminists hate men who don't have a girlfriend.  If you decide “fuck it, it's not worth it” and pursue your own life's goals sans female companionship, you're branded a loser.  \n\nFeminists hate men who pay for sexual services.  Pay your hard-earned money for the services of a prostitute and somehow you're exploiting women, even if it's in a Nevada brothel where all the professionals there do their trade willingly.  \n\nNow feminists are adding a new thing to hate men for.  If you don't do any of the above and instead buy a sex robot, something that hurts no one else and doesn't infringe upon anyone else's rights, they hate you for that.  \n\nThe only thing they won't hate you for is for being a man who has a six-figure income, looks like a model, and works as a doctor.  That's probably something like .004% of the male population.  The other 99 plus percentage of men are worthy of feminist scorn.  \n\nI never wanted to have to fight against feminists, but I will.  They're out to oppress male sexual freedom.  If you want to go MGTOW and just have sex with realistic robots, that should be your choice.  If you want to hire sexual services, that should be your choice.  If you want to stay in the game and search for a girlfriend, that should be your choice.  In all of these, as long as you don't force anyone to do anything against their will, it should be no problem.  However, feminists have a problem with you being anything other than a drop-dead model gorgeous dude who earns 500K as a doctor (or some other glamorous profession).  \n\nShoeonhead has made a great video mocking the hatred of feminists over sex robots: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nOsdj8dmc",

    "text": "\"brainwash\" -- norwegian documentary examines how fields like sociology and feminist studies reject actual science because it doesn't fit with their ideology [a quick background from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjernevask).\n\nyou can watch the 7-part series [here](http://www.dailymotion.com/playlists/user/BrainwashingInNorway/1). (not safe for work: nudity)\n\neach part is approximately 40 minutes long; i recommend watching #1 (gender equality paradox), #5 (sex), and #7 (nature or nurture) since they are most relevant to this subreddit.\n\n#7 nature or nurture:\n\nin this part, the interviewer interviews several social scientists, biologists, and medical experts in norway and elsewhere in the world. the social scientists want to push the idea that gender is a \"social construct,\" but the majority of biologists and medical experts soundly reject such ideas. the way the social scientists argue for their positions is both hilarious and frightening. a young baby boy (victor) was born with an undeveloped penis and doctors and surgeons removed the penis and then the boy was raised as a girl (victoria). victor was not happy with the feminine clothes he had to wear or the girly activities he participated in. victor (as a girl) had no idea that he was born a boy -- this is a counterexample to the theory that boys and girls are raised to fit into traditional gender roles. the \"gender researchers\" interviewed simply ignored his case. \n\n#5 sex:\n\ndespite feminists' insistence that culture shapes sexuality, researchers found that sexual desires are the same cross-culturally: men want more variation compared to women. women have evolved to desire less sexual partners due to the biological differences (pregnancy is more burdensome to women); women also want commitment from men as a result. men aren't as picky as women. \n\nwhen women were asked what they seek in relationships:\n\nshort-term: they wanted a man with a bad boy attitude, who has a tough and robust look, and good in bed.\n\nlong-term: a man who is considerate, a great personality, good provider, etc. \n\nevolutionary explanation: if it's going to be a short-term relationship, women will shop for the best genes rather than the best provider. \n\nthey also go into genetic cuckoldry (\"mama's baby, papa's maybe\") and how uncertainty of pregnancy affects male psychology. one of the most important things men look for in women for long-term relationships is faithfulness. women who have a lot of casual sex are rejected due to fears of infidelity.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

    "text": "Advice Needed: My brother says awful, sexist things around me to make me angry. Tldr included. He's the oldest. He does it to me in front of my sister and brother, both adults, and even in front of my mother. We were watching Doctor Dolittle, the old version, because he fancies himself the expert on all things cinematic. He made a comment calling the female's song \"If I were a man\" pointless to the story, when it actually outlines key aspects of the society at the time of the story. When I pointed that out, he just kept going and went from bad to worse.\n\nThing is, even if I keep my cool and don't act up, anything I do is wrong or inappropriate. I'm sick, too, with a hacking cold that's made me vomit at least three times now. Throughout the movie, he constantly kept asking if I was 'triggered' and making horrible comments, then staring at me, as if expecting a response.\n\nI left the room after he nearly sat on my laptop -asking simultaneously if he could sit on the ottoman that I was using to change from a youtube video, long after the movie had ended. I was disgusted by his conduct throughout everything, so I quietly got up and left the room. I could hear him talking and explaining that it wasn't his fault that I was triggered or couldn't control myself or some other rubbish like that.\n\nIf I do speak out against him, I have to do it as civilly as possible, because it's awful if the non-cussing daughter who always helps out around the house suddenly develops an affinity for verbally abusing her brother. At one point, he wasn't even paying attention to the movie; he was launching so much bile in my direction. I was too scared to contest it, so I just told him to pay attention, because he had really wanted to watch this, right?\n\nThing is, I know that if I stand up for myself, I won't get any support. I can take it to my parents, but they'll just say that he's an adult, and that there's nothing they can do to regulate his behavior anymore, pretty much giving him a free pass.\n\nBut I know that if I actually speak up I'll be called a bitch or an sensitive pansy who can't take a joke. I'll get verbally whipped again, and I'm pretty sure my parents won't stand up for me because I'll probably start crying and getting \"too emotional\" in the middle of everything.\nI'm not even what you'd call a \"femi-nazi\". I'm just a feminist; I just want equal rights. Sure, military enrollment for both sexes. And please give equal pay! That sort of basic stuff.\n\nI didn't want to post on the reddit feminism thread because that's blowing up with the Womens' Rights March news right now, and I definitely want advice, because I hate living like this and having to mutely tolerate whatever he throws at me. I can get a quip in one time in a million, but I know if I do it often... you know, the same old, same old.\n\nThing is, everyone in my family ignores it (And I believe I see them smirking at his comments), and now the 17 year old brother that I leave early 4/7 days to drive him to school is picking up on the trash my brother exemplifies. He even looked at me after saying something horrible and said, \"I'm glad ____ didn't say anything about that.\" I knew I couldn't because I'd be outnumbered again by these jerks, and I just didn't want to deal with it. Again, I'm miserably sick here.\n\nI have even been driving this kid 3 weeks in advance before my own Senior Semester starts. Oddly enough, I think my father would be more understanding than my mother in this situation.\n\nThis might be more suited for rants than advice at this point. But seriously, what do I do in this situation? How do I stop this sort of blatantly abusive treatment? Please don't suggest moving out; I'm not financially able to do so. And please don't suggest calling up cops/authorities. He's my brother, after all.\n\nTLDR: My brother is super vocal about women in a very negative way -just to try to get me mad. I feel trapped because if I say anything, I'm the bitch or the person who can't take a joke. I think he wants to be given an excuse to say this sort of stuff about me. My family ignores it to try to avoid a shitstorm. He's rubbing off on my 17 year old bro, whom I consistently sacrifice for to get him to school. What do I do to stop this?",

    "text": "Ashamed of the industry I work in, and don't know how to fix it. Throwaway because I don't want this associated with my main account. \n\nI am a graphic design and successfully manage all of the marketing for a large start up in the vapor/e-cigarette industry. I had originally planned on leaving in May of this year, but decided I would ask for a raise and extend my lease one extra year so I can work on paying off all of my debt and building a better nest egg before I move. \n\nI can't stand the city I live in, and further, I am legitimately ashamed of the industry for which I work (Further compounded, I'm in the early stages of dating a nurse, and *man* do I feel scummy). To top it off, I'm just feeling lost. I can't explain this feeling of hopelessness as best as I would like to, but I'm so worried there won't be another design job when I go to look in 8 months time. Did I choose the wrong field? How do I escape?\n\nI know I'm being irrational, there will be other jobs out there and I'll be able to get interviews. I can't help my thoughts, though, and it all stems from this feeling of being dirty because of a dumb industry. I mean, shouldn't you be proud of your job?\n\nThis is a half rant, half looking-for-answers post. The logical answer to all of this is I take my new raise and work it for the next 8 months and save everything then move on with my life. But I'm so emotionally drained and I don't know how to fix this all. \n\nThanks for reading.",

    "text": "To the milk crate stranger at 7-11: Thank you I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but I just really need to get this out there.\n\nI've been working my current job as a housekeeper at a private nursing facility for about a year and a half now. And I know this may seem weird but I love my job. My bosses couldn't be nicer. My coworkers are so loving and funny and supportive. And the job itself is really not that bad. I'm learning a lot and feeling like I'm actually making a difference.\n\nIn the time that I've been working there, I've never once had to call out sick. Sure there's been a few times where I've felt like calling out because of a bad headache or 'that time of the month' cramps. But I always had this sort of guilt, like, I finally have this job that I love and treats me right. To call out, I felt, that they would be disappointed in me. Also, as this not-yet-30 female who's only 4'8\", most of the time I feel like I constantly need to do more and prove myself. That I'm not just so kid who is constantly getting asked how old she 'really' is.\n\nAnyway, so yesterday morning, I woke up and found myself feeling not so well. I was feverish, lightheaded, and had zero appetite. But still, that little voice in my head said 'Don't let your bosses down. They've done so much for you.' So I pushed onward, driving into work and also stopping at the local 7-11, thinking that I might find something there that might appeal to my appetite.\n\nHowever, as soon as I got back to the refrigerated wall near the back of the store, I started feeling so much worse. I had one of the refrigerated doors open, thinking the cold air would help. It only emphasized my current state. And that just made me so upset and frustrated, wondering why I couldn't just push through this for 8 hours. Why couldn't I be stronger? I started crying, which only fueled my frustration and shame more. Here's this not-yet-30 'adult' crying in public, what a disappointment.\n\nSuddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and a voice beside me saying, \"It's okay, you can sit down.\" My current state overrode whatever confusion I had right then and I allowed myself to be sat down on what I later found out was one of those plastic packing crates for milk and such.\n\nThe owner of the voice was a man, probably in his late 40's, wearing a blue button down shirt and khaki pants. He crouched down beside me, hand never leaving my shoulder. That and his unwavering smile, and all that built up emotion just finally broke. \n\nI cried hard. Not that dainty Arwen-pretty crying but full out Robert-Downey-Jr-in-Tropic-Thunder crying, snot and all. And I was like that for a good 10 minutes, unable to talk or anything. And the whole time, he just crouched there, rubbing my shoulder, not saying a thing.\n\nFinally, the wave of emotions ebbed and I was able to calm down. \"So I'm not going to ask if you're okay, because clearly you're not,\" he said. \"And I'm pretty sure you probably don't feel like talking, much less to a complete stranger. But if you need someone to just shut up and listen to you, I could do that. My wife says I'm a great listener.\"\n\nAnd I don't know what it was because I'm usually such an introvert and have such a difficult time talking to other people. But the fact that this random guy was sitting there on the floor of a 7-11 at 5:30 in the morning, taking the time out of his probably busy schedule to help someone he didn't know. It just made me feel so cared for and that I could open up to him.\n\nSo I told him my story in a nutshell, having to stop a few times to collect myself. And he was right, he was a good listener. Never interrupted me once. And when I was done, he just sort of sat there quietly for a minute or two before saying anything. (And I'm going to try and recall everything he said but I might not get it word for word):\n\n\"Well, it seems like you really hit the jackpot. You have a job you love and bosses that treat you fairly and respectfully. And you have coworkers who you wouldn't mind seeing outside of work. That's quite an accomplishment right there.\" He pauses there. \n\"I have a daughter who's just about to finish up her freshman year of high school this May. And she just started her first job about a week ago at this clothing store at the mall. And she tells me she couldn't be happier. She gets to work with a lot of her friends from school, has a nice boss, and the work is not so hard where it starts to interfere with her studying. And I was actually at the mall just yesterday, so I stopped in to see how she was doing. Of course, I didn't let her see me as I didn't want to be one of those dads who embarrasses their daughters in front of their friends. And for the brief few minutes that I saw her, as she organized this table of shirts and laughed with one of her coworkers, I knew that she was really happy. And I know that her boss really appreciates the work that she's doing there, as I'm sure yours does. And I'm sure that, if your bosses really love and appreciate and respect you, that they wouldn't want you pushing yourself so hard that you make yourself sick. They would want you to take care of yourself. Because with all the care and dedication you put into your job, sometimes you need to put a little bit care back into yourself.\"\n\nHis words really hit home right then. So much so that I started tearing up again (happy tears this time). He then helped me to stand up and we made our way to the checkout line where he proceeded to talk about his current job (as a middle school science teacher) and how he had had a slew of other past jobs which he had never truly felt happy or appreciated in. And he told me that even though there are the not-so-great days at his work, he still feels like he's making a difference. \n\nOutside of the 7-11, he stops me before I go to my car. \"Now I'm going to need you to promise me that you're going to go straight home, curl up with as many blankets as you can find, and get a good sleep. You need to take care of you right now and that's all that matters.\"\n\nI made the promise and thanked him again and again. Then we parted ways.\n\nAnd even though I never got his name, I feel like I will never forget him. His quiet understanding or his kind encouragement. To know that there are still people out there, with the world in its current state, who are just so selfless and caring. It just makes me think there is hope after all. \n\nEdit: HOLY COW! I am just now getting home and finding this absolute plethora of messages, comments, and even a Gold (thank you most kindly Reedit_girl!)\n\nThank you all for your loving messages and support! \n\nAnd yes, I am feeling so SO much better now and was able to go back to work today.",

    "text": "My OBGYN just told me Plan B is 'an abortifacient' and that they 'don't do that' at his practice. So I just got back from an appointment with my gynecologist. I'm confused and ANGRY. \n\nFor some background,  I live in a very Mormon-y part of Utah, and my gynecologist is an older man who my mom knows and who is a bishop in the church. I'm 24 and have been slowly drifting away from Mormonism. \n\nAaaaaanyway, I've been having my annual exam with this guy for years. I just became sexually active this year, which goes against everything I was told growing up and was already pretty dang emotional for me. I had a slip-up with a condom a few days ago and immediately ran out and got Plan B.\n\nSo I go in to my appointment today, and when he sees Plan B on the list of medications I told the nurse about, he freezes, turns around, and asks me what happened with this disappointed look on his face. I blush and stammer out something, and then he tells me that it's an abortifacient (which I think I misheard as an 'abortive'?) and that they don't do that kind of thing at his practice (which, I mean, you don't need to. I already kind of took care of it! What the hell?!).\n\nHe asks if that means I'm sexually active, looking even more disapproving.\nHe tells me that I could very likely be pregnant, that they'll do a pregnancy test here but I should keep doing them at home for the next month, and that I should be bleeding from the Plan B pill already, but since I'm not it should really start soon (which isn't something I saw in any of the research I did. I know it can be a side effect, but I never saw anything that said it SHOULD happen).\n\nThrough the whole thing, he kept patting my shoulder or leg and saying, \"Be careful, dear\".\n\nI just feel like there was so much wrong with how that appointment went, but then I second guess myself because I'm not super well-educated on this. I never ever thought it would be something I would need to think about. If you have any insight, I'd love to hear it! Thank you.\n\nEDIT: Thanks to all of you who took the time to leave informed, compassionate responses. You're awesome :) \n\nA few notes:\n\nI DIDN'T ASK THIS DUDE FOR PLAN B. I JUST TOLD HIM I TOOK IT.\n\nHE'S NOT MY BISHOP, HE'S MY MOM'S DOCTOR. I'M JUST AWARE HE'S A BISHOP. \n\nIF YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT NO ONE'S MESSAGED ME TELLING ME I'M A HO, PLEASE DON'T WORRY, IT'S BEEN COVERED. \n\nI AM GETTING A NEW OBGYN.",

    "text": "Your cervix is INSIDE I made an account just to post this because I thought some of you would get a tickle out of my experience at the OBGYN yesterday.\n\nSo I went in for my yearly PAP but I also wanted to ask the doctor about a small bump I felt on my cervix. I wasn't super concerned about the bump because for once everything online told me I was almost certainly NOT dying from cancer but still, I wanted to ask my doctor to check it. \n\nI get to the doctor and the nurse checks my blood pressure etc. and then asks me if it's okay if a student comes in with the doctor. I say sure! I always do because they gotta learn somehow. Then she asks me \"if the doctor gets caught up with another patient, are you comfortable letting the PA perform your exam?\" I think for a moment and say no, because of the bump, I'd rather it be the doctor. \n\nOff she goes and the PA comes in to go over medical history. She was a very nice young woman, but clearly nervous. Everything I said she replied \"that's wonderful\" while furiously taking notes. The conversation went like this:\n\nME: I've been feeling a lump on my cervix for a few months now but as of last week, it actually seems to have gone away on its own. I can still feel a small rough spot where it was, though.\n\nPA: ...so the lump was on your vagina and-\n\nME: No, on my cervix. \n\nPA: Okay....the cervix is INSIDE....\n\nME: Right, I can actually touch my cervix. I've always been able to, and the lump was on the cervix, just next to the opening and now there's just a small rough spot there. \n\nQueue her looking shocked before laughing and commenting that I was \"very in tune with my body.\" I laughed too but I just couldn't get over that she didn't believe I could touch my cervix! No big deal, of course, but pretty funny. \n\nThe PA leaves to get the doctor, then comes back in with her and I realize I hadn't made the connection that she's also the student. With the doctor watching, she performs the World's Most Timid breast exam. I tell the doctor about the bump in full description (pea sized, hard, unmoving, painless) and without missing a beat she tells me it's 99% likely a harmless nabothian cyst. \n\nThe actual exam starts and the doctor asks if I'm comfortable letting the student perform the exam. At this point, I'm like please do!! You have to learn this! And she performs the World's Most Timid pelvic exam with the doctor talking her through it.\n\nThis was the kicker for me: she removes the speculum and the doctor tells her to put her fingers in to feel my cervix and try to find the rough spot. Let me tell you - this woman was close to putting her whole hand inside me! She went in as far as her hand could possibly go with more gusto than I ever could have anticipated. Again, I wasn't bothered at all because this is how she has to learn, but man, I was laughing inside. She finally felt my cervix after some intense wriggling and said she couldn't feel the spot where the bump was. The doctor has a go and immediately says she feels the dent and she's sure it was a nabothian cyst (unless PAP results say otherwise).\n\nSo that was that. I was really glad I hadn't agreed to see the PA without the doctor because clearly she still has some learning to do, but in the end, I guess I'm glad I was able to help!",

    "text": "Student emailed me about her step dad leaving her mom - need advice on how to progress Hey all,\n\nI have a student in 8th grade (maturity of a high schooler) who is really struggling. Her dad passed away when she was a child, and now her step dad has left her mom. \n\nShe has confided in me in person about her fear that they were going to divorce, but last night was when he finally left. \n\nShe emailed me and told me as such. I think she just wants an adult to hear her and validate her feelings, but she also doesn't trust many adults. I've tried to convince her to talk to our guidance counselor, but he's a man and I don't think she feels comfortable with that. It's not his fault at all. She just doesn't connect. \n\nBut I'm a little worried about the repercussions that could follow. You always hear that it's not your job to be the guidance counselor and if something does happen then you're responsible. But then you're also told to handle everything in your classroom. \n\nI think my goal should be to get her to agree to talking to our school psychologist, but I also know she is really hesitant to tell anyone anything (she is so sweet and just silently suffers because she doesn't want to burden anyone else). \n\nDo you guys have any experiences that could give me some insight on the best way to handle this? I don't want her to feel like I'm pushing her off onto someone else as she already feels so alone. She said she can't talk to her mom about it. She also won't talk to a friend (she feels she doesn't have any). \n\nI just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing for her and also for me. I hope this doesn't sound selfish. Her future is more important in my heart, but I'm also logically making sure not to endanger my career or her since I'm not certified to be a counselor. \n\n\nEdit: thank you to all that responded. I contacted the female guidance counselor. She's going to talk with the school nurse (who is good friends with the child's mom and the child hangs out with her at lunch at lot) to see if she would be open to talk with our psychologist. I also told the child to write some poetry about how she's feeling to help her get her emotions out.",

    "text": "26, had my CS degree since 21, been freelance coding since 13, sr software engineer at a multinational tech company, but considering a 180 in careers; or a career path change. WWYD? I feel like I need to change things up, like I'm stuck in a job that doesn't mean much, and doesn't help people who need it. I feel as if I'm just stuck here with everyone else, making fat cats who don't pay taxes in my country richer than ever. I feel I had my career path and degree chosen for me by people surrounding me simply because I enjoyed programming as a hobby, and was making a fair wage out of freelancing by 15 while still in high school.\n\n\n\n\nall this being said, the company I work for has been nothing but fantastic to me. my bosses are fantastic, everyone I work with is fun, we have a blast when we go on site and I get to see a lot of cool new shit that's yet to be released, or will never be released. I get to travel to see cool things the layman will likely never see for at least 20 years, I'm sub-contracted to places I'd never dream I'd see the inner-workings of, quite often, placed on projects that're time critical/sensitive and my brain's pushed to the max, and the euphoria of figuring something out that has been pondered over by the entire team for what feels like centuries can't be matched by any drug; it's the feeling I bet Edison felt once he figured out how to create light without fire after years of experimentation... that \"eureka!\" moment which I'm willing to bet all of you have experienced before.\n\n\n\n\nbut... I still feel unfulfilled. I'm contracted for another 6 months once I return (my bosses were kind enough to grant me 6 month leave from work to deal with my mental health and drug issues... how rad is that? that's why it's so hard to even think about leaving. I know I'll never score a job that's this *caring* about its employees, despite their image of being the big boogie man to outsiders) which lines up with the approx time I can start thinking about going back to Uni for a different subject in a whole new area.\n\n\n\n\nthat being said, is that what I really want to do? start from scratch, start from being a novice at something I've never done before? and Uni, well gosh... my first time at Uni wasn't a great experience... I actually hated it. I can barely read/write, maths/IT are my only strong points that carried me to even Uni entrance, and I have no idea how I passed my CS degree because I couldn't read my own handwriting, let alone the professors. I don't even think I needed the CS degree to land the job where I'm at, the only net positive I got from it was that I social-networked with a lot of people in the field, and one of the professors is the person who helped me fill in my resume for where I'm at currently, a couple years after I left Uni. \n\n\nI actually dread going back to uni, thinking about it, but if I changed careers and wanted to continue to live on more than minimum wage it's basically required since programming/IT has really been the only thing I've excelled at. I suspect I have ADHD, which I'm going to seek treatment for (can't on the NHS, thanks to my personal problems they'd think I just wanted legal meth. but I struggle even in the painting class I'm taking right now to relieve some stress while off of work. hell, speaking of work, I struggle there too sometimes. I really have to force myself to go into a zone it feels like or else I'll buzz around the room doing different things. I have to look into getting it treated privately, which I think I have insurance for from work, but I'm going to go the true private route and paying out of pocket so nobody knows I'm even looking into it, incase I don't have it. haha)\n\n\nI don't even know what I'd go back to uni for, honestly. I'd likely go for something to do with medicine/healthcare or science... be it a nurse, biologist, pharmacist or maybe surgeon (unlikely due to the amount of work vs pay ratio in the UK, and I don't want to spend my entire life savings going to the US to study. but surgeon has always been my dream job... I just sadly never had the confidence when I was younger, and now I suffer from poor vision that's corrected by RGP lens', mild tremors (I take beta blockers for them when needed, but I couldn't take them 24/7) and finally the biggie that all good CS peeps who're too lazy to fix their bad computer habits have: carpel tunnel!\n\n\n\n\nthis feels like therapy, writing my life story. but I would love some advice from others... maybe people who've been in similar situations and are out, or in, the field still.",

    "text": "Talk radio host Michael Savage's Depressing Attempts to Demonize Feminism (Among Other Things) Hey everybody. I haven't posted here before but I thought this recollection is relevant, both in an alarming way and as an example of the kinds of anti-feminist rhetoric making waves not only on r/Men'sRights, r/the_donald and the alt-reich pits of 4chan, but also on nationwide daily conservative talk radio.\n\nAs a fiction writer intrigued by the depths of conspiratorial thinking, conservative talk radio is like a nightmare paradise. I started tuning in pre-election to try and comprehend some of the right's perspective, principally the stuff the right is being told by their media. Aside from a constant stream of slant and innuendo, and general fear-mongering, this segment from a few weeks back really stuck out.\n\nSavage's topic: \"an epidemic of false rape allegations perpetrated by radical feminists.\" Fitting neatly with the \"Look at what's happening to our poor boys!\" trope, he asked for callers to relay experiences of faked accusations for the purpose of slander and character assassination. His first caller was a woman in tears. She was barely able to speak about experiencing a rape in her youth that she was never able to get herself to publicly admit before. It was very hard to hear, particularly when Savage was less than accepting at first, asking her why she never came forward, asking what she hoped to get out of admitting it now. Eventually he relented and wound the conservation toward some notion of an older, better America where \"your brothers would take care of it.\" \n\nThe next caller was a guy who was utterly on board with Savage's thesis. He said that his sister-in-law cooked up a story about him molesting her kids, even coaching them to lie to lawyers, in order to discredit him and get him fired from his job (which was successful.) When asked why she would do this, he said \"she just didn't like me\" (the most suspect sentence I've ever heard, BTW). Regardless, this fakery, while manipulative and wrong, had nothing to do with feminism and/or sexual assault of feminists. So Savage was 0 for 2 on his big evil topic. \n\nThe third was a guy who was raped while attending a christian monastery. It was another sobering discussion of sexual assault and the effects it has on the body and mind, denial, acceptance, the unstable road to recovery, etc. \n\nCaller after caller...zero examples of false rape allegations. The segment concluded with a nurse who specialized in processing rape victims, she laid out all the gory details of examination, while Savage tried to derail her data and facts with ideas like \"Well if there's no clear DNA evidence, the claim must not be believed, right?\" He didn't get far on this tract. Strangely, they ended up on mutual terms when ascribing a rise in rape incidents and rape culture to violent video games, violence in films and, both inherently racist and lazy, on rap music like Kanye West. The segment trailed off into Savage basically thanking his audience for a frank discussion of a very hard topic, and then the station was barraged by ads. \n\nConsidering where things ended up, it was easy to forget how it began-- Savage wanted to hear about devious man-hating and man-destruction by means of what he sees as a pivotal radical feminist tool, the pointed finger of accusation and the presumed guilt of the men being accused. But when exposed to real people in the audience, with real experiences, there was a near unanimous 180 degree turn. As brutal and frightening as his initial topic was, and how horrific it is that such concepts are preached to the masses as being some epidemic feminazi plot, he totally failed. It was heartening in a grim way. \n\nAnyway, thought I would share this attempt to demonize feminism, particularly because the response was not only lackluster but such a reversal. Other such BS, particularly online, gets hateful and vile very quickly.",

I'm 26 and have been applying for apprenticeships in Mechanical Engineering.\n\nAnd it's going terribly. \n\nI called a seriously promising lead that I was qualified for and the first question was \"How old are you?\". Thinking I still have around 40 years of working life left, I was honest. It got left with them whilst she contacted the Engineering manager.\n\nA week passes and she calls back this morning. \"Wouldn't fit the dynamic of the team due to age\".\n\nAt 26.\n\nShe then goes on to tell me that the government has funded 16-21 year old apprenticeships quite signigicantly at the moment, so even if I was 22 I'd still be a crochety old man stuck doing things 'the old way' in their eyes.

    "text": "Sharing a simple job search strategy that I think the vast majority of job searchers would benefit from Job searching is one of the most miserable activities known to man. I believe this strategy is more effective and less painful for a few reasons, notably that: it makes excellent use of your personal network and generates warm introductions; it allows you to hone and practice your sales/pitch/interview skills constantly; and it provides frequent opportunities for encouragement and self-affirming interactions. These are all rare perks in most job searches.\n \nI am not a career consultant or interview coach or recruiter. I am sharing as someone that has conducted several successful job searches on my own behalf, as someone who has hired and fired people, and as a former executive coach that has had a front row seat in many, many searches. In the last year I’ve also had a front row seat to the job searches of several very close friends as well as my spouse. \n \nI am not suggesting this is the best or only job search strategy, but if I had to bet all my marbles, personally, this is the way I would go. I am writing it down here in case you find it helpful. You can decide for yourself if it makes sense and you want to try it.\n \nAt a high level, this strategy is based off a technique from venture fundraising (I am CEO of a company that has raised capital from investors). In venture fundraising we say, “Ask for money and you'll get advice. Ask for advice and you'll get money.”\n \n> You can think of this strategy as the analog: *“Ask for a job and you'll get advice. Ask for advice and you'll get a job.*\n \nThe strategy goes like this:\n \n1. Make a list of contacts. These are people who have relevant skills, experience or network for your search and who like you enough to help.\n \n2. Email your contacts to ask for a 20-minute call or coffee date to get their advice and feedback. \n \n3. Meet them, describe your value proposition to employers, your skill set and your job search strategy. Let them react, and ask for advice and feedback.\n \n4. Before you finish the conversation, ask for at least one introduction for the purpose of further advice, feedback and brainstorming. (Do NOT if they know of job opportunities.)\n \n5. Repeat steps 2-4, continuously expanding your web.\n\n6. Follow up every 1-2 weeks with each contact on your list, to stay top of mind.\n \n7. You will get warm introductions as opportunities come across your network’s radar, moving you to the top of the pile immediately as jobs become available.\n \nAs you execute these steps, you're building an ever-expanding network of people who are now enlisted in helping with your job search. \n \nAs part of the conversation (step no. 3), you are actively pitching each person on your value, but you’re sneakily doing it under the pretense of getting feedback. People’s walls will come down and you’ll activate their desire to help. (I recently learned that this is one of the 8 core needs in Maslow’s hierarchy -- no joke.)\n \nEventually you will get introduced to someone who hires you.\n \nI know that the devil is in the details so if you want more details, keep reading. I’ve broken down the steps using a hypothetical example and provide some example emails and exact wordings you can use. However, remember that copying other people’s language is a good way to sound like a robot, so make sure to make these your own.\n \n****************\n\n**Step 1: Make a list of contacts**\n \nThe heart of your strategy is to build a network of people who are thinking about you and your job search, so you'll need a way to keep track of all these people.\n \nInclude column headings for:\n \n> Name - Jane McDougal\n \n> Organization - High Flying Avionics\n \n> Email - jane.mcdougal@hfavionics.com\n \n> Phone number - 212-867-5309\n \n> Who introduced you - [blank if she is your contact]\n \n> Action required - Yes\n \n> Next action - initial email\n \n> Notes - [none yet]\n \n**Step 2: Write an email requesting a phone call or coffee**\n \nHere's a template you can use:\n \n> Subject: Advice?\n \n> Hi Jane,\n \n> I hope all is well!\n \n> [As you know] I’m exploring new career opportunities [in avionics industry] and was wondering if you'd be up for a call [or coffee] in the next week or two. I would love some advice on my strategy and positioning, and, if you don't mind, maybe some ideas on people to connect with.\n \n> Thanks so much. If workable for you, I'm available [time block 1] or [time block 2].\n \n> Best,\n> [YOU]\n \nYou can change this template as you like, but keep in mind the principles at work here:\n* Concise: gets to the point quickly\n* Request is clear -- they know exactly what they're signing up for\n* Focuses on your desire for advice while getting their wheels turning on other contacts for you\n* Let's them know the type of advice you want so that they feel confident they can provide it (and not waste either of your time)\n* Provides scheduling options to reduce back and forth\n \nYou might also notice that the request is passive: there is no question mark. (\"Can we talk?\" vs \"I was wondering if we could talk.\") This is intentional. The passive request doesn't make the other person feel put on the spot for a reply and therefore makes them feel a greater sense of choice and autonomy in offering support.\n \n**Step 3: Conduct the meeting**\n \nI suggest approaching the meeting as follows:\n \n* Get connected. Depending on your relationship with Jane and your cultural context, this could take 30 seconds or 30 minutes. The point is, be human.\n \n* Get down to business. After you get connected, make a decisive and clear pivot to talk business. Don't let the conversation wander or avoid the topic. Jane signed up to help and it's your job to honor that contract. You can segue by saying, \"OK, so let me tell you about what's going on.\" Jane may do this for you by saying, \"OK, so tell me what's going on.\"\n \n* Set the agenda. Explain: \"Let me tell you about what I'm looking for and how I'm going about that. I'd love your input on both my approach as well as how I'm positioning myself.\"\n \n* Share your value proposition. Talk about what you're great at and what kind of value you believe you can provide. (You're doing this in the context of getting feedback, but notice how you've created an opportunity to pitch yourself!) IMPORTANT: Be prepared with a clear and compelling pitch. Ideally, Jane walks away with an unforgettable snapshot of the value you can provide, so that as soon as she learns of a good opportunity she will think of you. When you're done sharing, ask for input: \"What are your thoughts? How can I improve my pitch?\"\n \n* Share your job search strategy. Explain how you're focusing on warm introductions and meeting great people in the field, because you never know who is hiring. Ask: \"What do you think? Does that make sense?\" Most of the time Jane will affirm your approach.\nGet new contacts - Jane may offer you an introduction or two without being asked. If not, and if it feels appropriate, you can go ahead and say, \"Would you mind thinking of one or two people in your network who might also have advice and ideas for me?\" Notice how you're not asking Jane who is hiring (she probably won't be able to think of anyone) -- you're just asking for people with advice and ideas (which everyone has). This makes it much, MUCH easier for Jane, who provides a few names: Lamar Garvey and Samantha Marshall.\n \n* Write down the names, say thanks and let them know you'll follow up. Tell Jane that you'll send her an email that she can forward to Lamar and Samantha.\n \n*Let me expand a little on the idea of sharing your value proposition.*\n \nInside your head, it might be very clear what you do, what you’re good at, what you’re looking for, and so on. But other people are not. They need a “handle” of sorts, an extremely simple and memorable way to think of you vis-a-vis job search.\n \nTo that end, I suggest coming up with a few assets:\n \n* A pithy job search headline. E.g. “Embedded systems engineer passionate about avionics.” You should use this early and often, modifying it slightly so you sound human. \n \n* Three to five key selling messages with stories. You need a little meat on the bone for these conversations, but you don’t want to wing it. You want to make sure you hit the most important messages, and stories is the best way to do so. \n \n(What do I mean by a story? When I talk about my passion for great workplaces, I talk about the time I was 23 and bought some hip new shoes but wasn’t sure I could wear them on casual Fridays because they had white soles. I never forgot because I was so excited to show them off but was stressed enough that I didn’t wear them. This story brings home the idea that I’m passionate about people feeling safe at work in a few sentences. That’s what you want -- to reinforce your key points with a quick story or non-hypothetical example.)\n \n**Step 4: Follow up to facilitate the introductions**\n \nIntroductions are sensitive territory. If the introduction breaks down at any point it reflects badly on everyone. For that reason you need to pro-actively manage this part of the process.\n \nHere's an email template you can use:\n \n> Subject: [Your name] intro to Lamar O’Donnell\n \n> Hi Jane,\n \n> Per our discussion I’d love to connect with Lamar O’Donnell to get his advice. [Add a human and non-transactional reason why, e.g. “Based on your description it sounds like we’d hit it off, and given his sales experience I thought he might have some pointers on how I describe my value, too.”]\n \n> As context (feel free to forward this to Marty directly if helpful), I’m a lifelong software engineer with a passion for all things flying and avionics. I have 20 years experience in embedded systems (Motorola, Intel) and a burgeoning web development skill set. My LinkedIn, if helpful, is http://linkedin.com/yourname.\n \n> Thanks!\n> YOU\n \nThis makes it easy for Jane to forward the email, add a short note, and wait for Lamar and Samantha to reply. Then she can just copy you in on the thread and be finished.\n \nNow, you should add Lamar and Samantha to your list, and keep the ball rolling.\n \n****************\n\n**A few thoughts on why this approach works**\n \nIt’s a big deal to commit whole hog to a new job search strategy (you can only do so much, I understand). So, these are some of the reasons why the strategy works, and why you might consider giving it a try.\n \n**1. People want to help**\n \nPeople can relate to the sucky-ness of a job search. Saying that you're looking will activate the \"helper\" gene that lives inside so many people. If you're not asking your network for help, you're snubbing a whole bunch of people who could feel good because they helped.\n \nAlso, according to Abraham Maslow’s research, one of our 8 core needs is called Transcendence, the need to help others achieve their potential. You are tapping into a universal need here -- pretty neat.\n \n**2. Your request for advice is flattering**\n \nWhen you send out your initial email requesting some time and advice, your ask is flattering: you want their advice. People like to give advice because it suggests that who they are is valuable.\n \nBy the way, people may offer connections for the same reason: their network reflects well on them, so they will want to impress you with who they know by offering those contacts to you.\n \n**3. Your ask is small and clear**\n \nPeople are also much more likely to say \"yes\" to a request when they feel that the boundaries of their \"yes\" are clear. There is no slippery slope. Your request is for time and advice, and possible ideas on further connections. That is a clear boundary so easy to say yes to.\n \n**4. You get to pitch your value to everyone you meet**\n \nYou're pitching yourself at every meeting, except normally being pitched makes people resist. In your case, they're just listening to as to provide feedback, which has the opposite effect: they're listening more closely.\n \nThe process of providing the feedback will help them internalize and remember your pitch, as they will begin to get their fingerprints on it and take ownership of it. Now they can more easily think of you and advocate for you to others.\n \n**5. Making requests in person is 34 times more effective**\n \nMost people think an email request is about as effective as one made in person, but requests made in person are 34 times more effective (!!!). This strategy gets you face to face before you ask for introductions, dramatically improving your odds of getting access to valuable new contacts.\n \nHere’s a Harvard Business Review about this. \nhttps://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email\n \n**6. Every opportunity has a warm introduction**\n \nUsing this strategy, everyone you meet is through a warm introduction. You can bet that everyone who ever posted a job online would rather meet a candidate through a warm introduction than an online portal.\n \n**7. Going through your network will improve culture/values fit**\n \nPeople you get along with are more likely to know other people you'll get along with. By meeting people through your network, you increase the chances that the hiring manager at the end of the chain is someone you'll also get along with.\n \n**Bonus: Get positive affirmation and build momentum as you go**\n \nThis human-to-human approach will provide numerous opportunities to be acknowledged for your value. As you solicit feedback on your pitch, each of your contacts will help you dig for the gold in your experience and continuously reframe yourself in an ever-more positive light. Each introduction becomes an opportunity for acknowledgement, as your contact seek to enlist their own contacts in spending time with you.\n \nGetting positive affirmation is NOT superficial -- it is an important and necessary part of building and sustaining momentum during your job search. Embrace and enjoy it.\n \n****************\n\n**To sum up, here’s what you need to execute this strategy**\n \n* Tracking spreadsheet (I like Google sheets or Airtable)\n* Initial outreach email template\n* Followup email template\n* A pithy headline for your job search\n* 3-5 key selling messages, each one with a story to illustrate\n \nAgain I am not an expert but if you have questions on this technique I’m glad to discuss in the thread.",

    "text": "Stay in excellent job or go back to live in my own country? I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).\n\n**Background:**\n\nA bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.\n\nI recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.\n\nI have two options to choose from:\n\n**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**\n\nI have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.\n\nMy one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.\n\nAlmost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.\n\nIn the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.\n\nBesides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house \nI also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. \nI have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.\n\n**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**\n\nI mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.  \n\nRegarding finances, i will have around 20k of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",

Just kinda spontaneously happened\n\nHonestly, I dont think posting this question will really do me any good and all, mainly because of my own incompetence, but I figured I have all the free time in the world so I dont think it could hurt to try.\n\nIm 26 soon to be 27 year old male who has lived with my parents all my life. I graduated with a Bachelors in Political Science at the age of 22, so I figured I was on track and on time to living a normal life like everybody else. I dont actually care for the subject I majored in. It was just my parents always told me that having a college degree is better than not having a degree, so I went off to college and became the first one in my family to get a degree, or at least a Bachelors I think. I figured I was never going to have the intelligence/will/skill/enthusiasm to be something like a Doctor/Engineer/Businessman, but I also figured Political Science wasn't on the bottom tier like Underwater Basketweaving or something like that. Figured I had chosen a decent middle of the road major. \n\nI wasnt an honor roll student during the time at the 4 year college I went to, but I think I am at the community college Im currently going to to obtain my Associates in Homeland Security, though I dont think that really counts since I take a low amount of classes each semester, though I will be having the Associates by the end of this December I think.\n\nAnyways after I got the Bachelors, my father would look online for Jobs for me, since I have not even the slightest clue on how to look for jobs. I figured it would make more sense for my parents to look since they have all the life experience and are responsible adults who've already done this. Couldnt really find anything for 6 months. \n\nThen my only real life friend who I still have in close proximity told me to come work with him at Giant Grocery Store. My parents told me its better to have SOMETHING on my resume, to show that Im willing to work, even if it is just at a grocery store. To show that Im not sitting on my ass all the time. So I work their for 1.5 years, simply as a Salad Bar Clerk. Had no problems with the job at all, I liked the people there, figured it could always be much worse. I had perfect attendance there, while everybody else in my Department would call out sick every other week. I was hired part time, but they eventually pushed my hours beyond 40, even though I still wasnt considered full time. I didnt really want more hours, all I wanted was to just have something on my resume saying that I didnt sit on my ass all the time. Figured it was kinda an interesting *problem* since every other worker in the store would complain about a lack of hours, while they kept increasing mine. Whenever my managers would ask me to stay later for whatever reason, I never declined, even if I didnt want to, because I figured I got nothing better to do, and Im a complete beta male who can't really say no.\n\n Heck, I remember we hired this 1 foreign chick who couldnt really speak or understand english, yet was supposed to close the Salad Bar on her first day of work, which I knew there was no way in hell I could successfully teach her verbally and I would get off work earlier than her, so she will inevitably screw up and then make us be behind the next day, so I decided to come in on my own time off the clock and stay with her for 2-3 hours closing the salad bar with her just to have an on the job first hand understanding on what to do. Luckily my manager saw this and thanked me. \n\nSo anyways I eventually put in my 2 weeks, because I wasnt sure if working there was actually helping me find a government job or not. I figured if this wasnt helping, maybe I needed more schooling? Maybe I majored in something bottom tier and I was just too stupid to know better? My managers seemed to try really hard to make me not quit, since they knew they could rely on me to consistently do what I've been doing. Which by the way, I wasn't even remotely close to the best in the Salad Bar. My superior was this lady who was like 10 times more productive than me, but I still felt appreciated even when I clearly wasnt the best. They even gave me a cake when I left. (Though I have no idea if thats standard operating procedure and Im just reading too much into it and hyping myself up because of my ignorance)\n\nAnyways, I put in an application for the TSA. I passed all their tests and then got invited for an interview. I failed the interview for some reason. They dont tell you why. Which really bummed me out. I figured if I never know what I did wrong I could never improve myself. So I was really starting to get sad. \n\nI think I graduated from Salisbury in Maryland in 2013. Then late 2013 started to work at Giant for 1.5 years and then left during 2015.\n\nEver since 2015, I havent worked anywhere. My parents have tried putting applications in whatever they could find, though an overwhelming amount of them require much more education than I currently have, and something required me to have been an honor roll student, or various other things. By the way, this is just what my parents have told me, I have never actually looked for a job myself, because I cannot even begin to formulate a thought on how to start. My logic is my parents would know better than me. \n\nI think this is where I should say my parents are the greatest parents in the world, I dont even need to know any of you or anybody else to make such a declaration. I dont think my parents are rich, but I think they are definitely above middle class I think. Im not sure really. Dad said he might close to 6 figures and Mom made much less than that, but for a family of 3 that seems pretty good to me, my apologies if I really have no clue to what the answer is, I think I've lived a sheltered life, well, at least since highschool and beyond, no idea how to make friends anymore, since all the ones I had in Elementary school and Middle school have moved to other states and such. So much easier as a kid, so I basically stay inside my room all the time. I mean I've pretty much never had to do chores around the house! Like ever! I've barely ever taken out the trash, wash dishes or clothes, vacuum, etc etc the entire course of my life so far. They dont even complain about me! I ask them all the time if it was better if I just went somewhere else to not be a parasite on them anymore but they always tell me its okay dont worry about it. My Dad always tells me its not my fault, its just the bad economy or something, though I personally dont believe that. I think its clearly something wrong with me. I just wish I had a \"How to figure out Life\" guide or something\n\nHell as Im typing this I cant help but think how damn lucky I am to have parents like this. I make sure to not act like a brat, and whenever they tell me to do something for them, Ill certainly do it. But anyways, I think I've been getting off track and sadly this seems more like a blog post or something so now I think Im starting to regret even typing this out because now it might seem cringey as fuck or something, which it probably is. Im basically admitting Im just a giant man child\n\nSo ever since leaving Giant, I havent found a job. I dont know if I should just give up on even thinking about getting a gov job. Maybe I should go back to working at Giant? Or somewhere else? I have no idea. I know my Dad would say maybe working at Giant is not so bad since maybe you could work your way up and do some security stuff, i dont know. \n\nIn reflection, I really dont think I have any skills worth a damn. I know Im somebody who will never miss a day of work. Hell I had perfect attendance in middle school and got an award for it which made me feel special. But when I look on Facebook at all the buddies I used to know, people who never had opportunity like me, who never had amazing parents like I had, who never even went to college like me somehow have their life in order. People who from what I assume to be self sufficient individuals who have figured out their formula for life. I just get some damn jealous. \n\nWell, thats all I can think of at the moment. Im sure theres some more important information I could've listed. But frankly Im already embarrassed as hell that I somehow made some ridiculous blog post. But at this point. I think Ill take some hits to my ego just for some advice. It doesnt have to be good or anything, Im sure there are plenty of people worse off than me or something, but if you dont mind, Id like to know what I should do. Should I just find some random private sector job and start working immediately? Just to continue building the resume? Surely its better than me not doing anything at all for the past 2 years",

    "text": "As a child of rape, I would understand if my mother aborted. This is for anyone who is debating having an abortion or not. I want you to know, no choice is the wrong choice. \n\nGrowing up I didn't know my donor (aka my father, but I refuse to call him by such a worthy name). The only thing I knew about him was that if my mother saw him while we were out, she would grab us and run as fast as she could in her car and race off. I had no idea what was going on. She seemed frightened. I never understood why...\n\nWhen I was 14 I met extended family from my donor's side, I finally had a chance to meet the man I had been dreaming about. The man that would make me whole and explain who I truly am. \n\nI met him and it was great. We got a long really well. I went to seem him and my family as much as possible. One day he asked to speak with my mom. I asked her and she said no. I asked why? She contained to tell me no. \n\nOne day she dropped me off at his house and he came outside and hello to her, she looked stiff and afraid and was very cold. I didn't understand. I asked her what was wrong but she ignored me and said go ahead. \n\nAfter a year of being around this man, our new found relationship started to sour. He would ask for money and use it to purchase drugs. One day I had enough. I was raised by my grandfather and he never EVER resorted to such despicable levels. Luckily I had enough common sense to know this was not right and called him to tell him I never wanted to speak to him again. He agreed and that was the end.\n\nI went to my mother and explained what happened. She said \"let's talk.\" We sat down on my bed and proceeded. \"You were born out of rape.\" I never wanted to have a child by this man.\" The day it happened he was high and beat her with my sister in the other room. She was on birth control but it failed and she found out she was pregnant a few months later. \n\nShe continued to explain that even though she called the cops, he would always come back and beat down her door and she was almost to the point of being evicted so she would let him in. She told me she didn't believe in abortion and it wasn't my fault so she decided to keep me and she does not regret it. \n\nMy heart sank. I flashed back to all the times she ran away in terror and all of the times I asked her to talk to the man who brutally beat and raped her. \n\nI asked her to continue the story and tell me everything. She continued to explain that after I was born, she tried to involve him in my life, but he continued the beating. \n\nSide story: My sister once told me how he was babysitting us while my mom worked and he was smoking crack, she smelled the smoke and pulled me into the closet to protect me. She was only 5 years old. It didn't make complete sense until now. I cry every time of think of this, my sister protecting me. That was the last time. \n\nThe final straw, after the cops had failed to keep this man from beating down her door, was the final time he visited the house high. This time he threatened my life. He picked me up in front of my mother and held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me. I wasn't even a year old. My mother screamed and finally let him beat her bloody. \n\nShe grabbed us and drove as quickly as she could to our grandparents house. She proceeded to buy a gun and wrote his name on the bullet. \n\nLuckily she never used it. The gun went missing, we found it years later in my grandfathers room.\n\nAfter this she met my little brothers dad, he in a way helped save her. He helped save her because when this man would come around ignoring the restraining order, my brothers dad would be there and made sure my donor didn't come anywhere near us. I am eternally grateful for that. \n\nAfter I found out all of this, I broke down in tears. My mother, who over everything else was always 100% honest and so strong. Didn't tell me this sooner because she wanted me to find out who he truly was and make that decision on my own. She spoke to him in fear and waited. It still kills me to this day.\n\nI want to tell you. If I was her, I would abort. I told her I wouldn't have blamed her if she did. She had to look at me every day of my life as a constant reminder of what she went through. \n\nShe said that it wasn't my fault. \n\nI work hard everyday and have become very success and I feel she deserves everything for keeping me. I will give her what this man took. I will be buying her a house as soon so she can live comfortably out the rest of her days.\n\nI am the product of my mother. I am her strength, and her will. I have become successful because of her influence. I help others and she does. She never makes me feel anything but love. I wish I could be half the woman she is!\n\nThis man has no claim to the person I am and the person I have become. I have seen him in passing in my hometown but he does not exist in my world. No anger or hatred, just existence. \n\nSo as the child of a situation like this or any situation where you feel you need to abort the child. If they were alive, they would understand. I'm alive and I understand. \n\nIf you decide to keep them and struggle through it all. Know they will love you with everything. \n\nI would love my mother either way. So make the decision that is right for you.  \n\nI want everyone to know that she has met the love of her life now and he treats her like the queen she deserves to be and has restored her faith. \n\nIn Summary: I was the child of rape, my mother chose to keep me instead. I told her I would have understood if she did abort because if I was in that situation I would have aborted my child. I told her I would love her even if she did. No woman should have to go through what she went through.  \n\nEdit: Wow. I just woke up and saw this. Your stories brought me to tears. Thank you very much for your kind words! My mother is my pillar of strength. I'm glad she trusted me to make the right choice. After I was born he left her life, she went to school and became an engineer. She didn't finish high school so it became a turning point to be independent of men as she says. She has raised my sister and I to be very strong. We know how to fix our own cars from oil changes to tire changes, use power tools, and take care on our own. Happy Mother's day to all of the mother's out there who kept us through the pain and healing!",

    "text": "Benign chats with co-worker have resulted in me being threatened by his girlfriend. I'm a female, married, engineer for a wood mill. It's a 25:1 male to female ratio. We use chats to communicate between departments. \n\nI've been chatting with a male co-worker, of whom I have a LOT in common with. He's the kind of guy I'd probably be excellent platonic friends with. But we keep it absolutely pro at all times. I knew he had a girlfriend and respected her enough to not flirt or imply anything that could be misconstrued as inappropriate work talk. \n\nI mentioned that my hubby and i built a kickass DIY hot tub over the weekend, big enough to fit four adults. He responded that he wishes he had a hot tub. I said maybe in the future, I could invite him over for a BBQ & soak with us. He joked that his girlfriend probably wouldn't be ok with that (Cause she's inherently jealous and insecure around other women)\n\nCut to 2am last night... I'm woken up from a dead sleep with chats from 'him' blowing up my phone. This wakes my husband and I up. Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...\n\n\"I read what you said to my man. Hes right, I dont and wud never approve of you. Be a rel woman and find a man who's not taken. You're a fucking horrible woman. I'll keep an eye out for you.\"\n\nThese kind of poor grammar and awfully assuming messages continue for an hour. I turned my phone on silent.\n\nThis morning I found out she stole his phone & car in the middle of the night while he was sleeping. Cruised around with her friend while basically messaging the two women he chatted with that she thought was a sexual threat (namely me and one other woman at the mill)... My co-worker was just written up for it (Cause the messages were awfully harassing of us women and all from HIS work profile)\n\nNow, I'm looking over my shoulder to make sure she's not stalking the mill. She now knows my full name, what vehicle I drive, my cell number, and work email. He told me she doesn't work at all, and is apparently affiliated with a local gang, and one of get last messages to me says if she felt threatened again she'd 'hire someone'...\n\nAll this is petty and incredibly immature drama, I'm positive nothing is going to develop from this after today, but I needed to vent... I've NEVER experienced someone so scared or angry at other women. Not in school. Not in slutty friend/fr-enemy circles... Never.\n\n- I've told my co-worker I cannot chat with him about anything other than work from now on. And told him that if she does this kind of shit in the middle of the night again (or anytime for that matter) that I'll call the cops on HER for ongoing harassment and intent for criminal mischief. He told me \"don't do that\" he didn't want the cops called cause \"she'd be arrested again\"\n\nFACE PALM.",

I'm also a man, which I understand is uncommon in nursing. I live near Boston (Somerville), which seems to be the mecca of hospitals for some reason. I see nurses everywhere, so I assume the job market is good, but I don't *really* know. I have some money saved up, enough to support myself for a few years and pay for a cheap school.\n\nI reached out to an old friend of mine who is studying nursing and they were able to answer some of my questions w.r.t. schooling. From what I understand, so long as you pass the licensing exam, whether you get an associates in nursing or a bachelors, once you get a job you're pretty much in the same position. I was thinking I'd knock out the pre-reqs at a community college, then get an associates and take the licensing exam.\n\nNow, the questions:\n\n* Does what I've said so far seem generally reasonable? Anything I'm overlooking? Is an ASN the right way to go?\n* What is your job like, day to day? I understand this varies depending on whether you're in a practice or a hospital or w/e, but any info is helpful.\n* Any advice about schools?\n* If I got an associates, would I be able to study to become a NP after working a while, or would I need to complete a bachelors to enter an NP program?\n* Job market in and around Boston?\n* Any good resources about nursing schools etc..",

(terminology) Hi everyone,\n\nI am a court reporter who is working on a transcript and there's a few things I'm unsure of/can't find online by Googling.

What's going to matter is the NEURO/AL (?) knob that maintains the length of the stabilizer bar.\"  \nI know this obviously isn't neural or neuro but that's what it sounds like to me.\n\n2. \"the ladder stand's designed is that when a user beginning climbing the ladder stand based on the design, the EQUALLER is pushed towards the tree.  So in other words, the ladder stand's pushed in towards the tree, the top portion?\n\n3. \"That would be highly unlikely because if you -- it's basically an area of quasi-stable equilibrium, so it's like balancing a chair on one leg.  That's quasi-stable equilibrium.  You can do it, but any small PROVERVATION is going to cause it to move to one way or the other, such as either it's going fall over or it's going to fall on to the legs.  Similar situation here exists.\"\n\n4. \"Do these propose or suppose that the friction is eliminated or reduced to the point where the ladder stand can begin to bend because it's no longer in contact with the tree or in sufficient contact with the tree?  \nA. Well, the friction force is up there on Page 24 that's  F SET F. (is this a math term?)\nSo it can have any value; it can have negative value; it can have 0.  So what I'm showing is just literally the free body diagram.  \n\n\nThank you in advance for everyone's help!",

    "text": "Trying to find a great lost story A few years ago somebody directed me to a website where an engineer detailed his journey building a house in the woods. It was a personal website like a blog, with an old \"web 1.0\" look (think 2002). I remember it had a light green background and walls of text broken by occasional pictures.\n\nIt was an inspirational and fascinating read. The man cleared the spot for the house, dug his own water supply and drainage, and I think he made his electricity by a hydro power generator he built himself. As I recall, he did everything himself, with a little help from his son when digging the water supply/drainage ditch. I think the house itself was pentagonal, or maybe it was octagonal. And I seem to recall it being built on platforms.\n\nDoes anybody recall seeing this website? Do you have a link? I'd love to read through it again.\n\n**EDIT:** Many thanks to /u/Emeja for finding it! http://ludens.cl/paradise/paradise.html  I think it's a great story for engineers, self-starters, and DIY-types alike to read. Especially the microhydro plant. http://ludens.cl/paradise/turbine/turbine.html",

    "text": "French drain redone - not sure the job is good Hello,\n\nI'm posting here seeking advice and help. I've engage a contrator to repair my french drain. I had bad water infiltration in my house (1960s original drain). Here is the story of everything. This will be a photo story using my album at: https://goo.gl/photos/rdXYiFdbUd1nXhuk6. Also, sorry for my english, it isn't my main language. It's also very long.\n\nEverything start with water infiltration in the basement. The first pictures shows the water infiltration at various state. This is right under the outside back door. Many person came to my house checking it and they all said it's water infiltration because of defective french drain. I decided to look for a contractor that would do that and, at the same time, change my sanitary exit one because it has roots cloging it every years.\n\nThe next picture is the beginning of the work. The guy with a blue jacket is the man I talk to and sign contract with. The big orange excavator is a man he engage himself to do the digging because his team were busy somewhere else. Needless to say, this guy is an expert with his excavator, precise and no damage anywhere. The other guy in the blue shirt and a shovel is the plumber I contracted to do the work. As far as the sanitary replacement goes, everything is a success.\n\nAs you can see in the photos already, the earth that are excavated is deposed directly on good unprotected ground. This will do damage and we'll see that later.\n\nContinuing on, the engage man with the orange excavator continue to dig around the house since he was contracted for 6 hours of work. Everything he did was perfectly executed, no damage to anything except the fact that no ground was protected of the excavation (not his fault, he did ask the guy I contracted).\n\nContinuing on, we can see at some point, before the picture showing my backyard with the pool, that some walls already have some fondation tape seal (soprema). Probably the old owner made some repairs himself at some point. While we are at the backyard, we can see the paving stone. I ask my contractor to remove them because they are broken, uneven and only cause trouble. He said no problem. While removing them, we found a surprise, there is 4 slab of cement in the ground! The old owner probably laid down cement as a base for his paving stone. He removed 2 of the 4 slabe, leaving 2 of them in the ground. As we can see, everything is again layed down on an unprotected ground.\n\nThe following picture show more of the plumber doing his work. Nothing special to see here.\n\nAfter that, we can see a small excavator. This is the small one my contractor own. While using it, it broke down where it is right now. They dug the remaining (that the other guy with the big excavator didn't dug) with this one and a medium one. But, with both excavator, they were pure amateur. They scratch the house fondation, bump hard on it, it even left some mark on it. I'm unsure if I have picture of that though, we'll see on the way.\n\nNext is a picture of one side of my house after the small excavator tried to dig. Was too small so he left it like that. We can see some styrofoam on the wall and the ground, plus the same fondation tape sceal and the fondation slab.\n\nAfter is a picture of the isolofoam HD I made him bought to install. It was recommanded by the compagny selling those thing and said it was made to go underground.\n\nThe pictures after that show an underground tube where a power cable goes from my house to my garage. I had already said many time to my contractor that such a cable existed somewhere so he dug by hand to find it. But then, once they find it, the guy with the excavator did such a good job that he broke the piping and, as we can see on the wall, the protecting case of the main power cable on the house.\n\nAfter that, we can see more of the excaved walls with some protection and styrofoam on it, then pile of dirt all around my house, on unprotected good ground. As we can see in the pictures, there's an old patch under my door in the backyard, right where water enter. There's also a lot of water reaching the footing. They also taped temporary the stuff they broke to prevent dirt and water entering. By the way, the underground piping going to my garage goes straight into my basement wall right next to my electric panel.\n\nThe next pictures are various view of the excaved ground. We can see sometime the old french drain (orange piping, in ceramic). We can also see it goes under my chimney. Then more picture of them, excaving the remaining where my parking his. As you can see, they freely roll the excavator on my neiboor grass without any protection. Needless to say, they scrap his perfect grass.\n\nOn the next picture, we see a man in a hole with a grey and black wall. He his currently putting some fondation seal. I took some picture of the stuff, it's the green and black bucket \"resisto seal\". The preparation before putting this? They brushed the wall with a big brush. Nothing was shoot on the wall to clean it, no pressure washing, drying, just removed the rough with the brush. Also, as you can see, they didn't pump out the water, thus everytime they walked there, splash came on the wall and on the footing. We can clearly see the end of the footing unproteted. Also, they didn't check if the old patch on the fondation at that place was ok, they just cut the extra that wasn't sticking on the wall.\n\nMoving on, we reach the chimney with the resisto seal. I you recall on other picture, they was an old fondation tape seal on the wall that wasn't sticking properly. Instead of cleaning the hole wall by removing it, they simply cut loose part and sprayed it over. Again, without cleaning anything. You can clearly see it on other picture where there's resisto seal on the left of the chimney and the old soprema patch still there.\n\nAfter is some picture of the isolofoam I had to take for tax credit.\n\nLater, we see a \"completed\" wall. We see the resisto seal, then the isolofoam and the delta-ms covering. As you can see, the delta-ms isn't thigh on the installation as it should. It's also dripping in water all around the house (mostly). Nothing was dried out, they just put it there. Looking at the picture were we see the basement windows and door, we can see 4 nail to hold the delta-ms and one directly in the corner. Needless to say, that's not how it suppose to be done if we check on the delta website. Also, we see clearly all the water going under the delta-ms at the bottom and the bottom of the delta-ms roughly cut at many place, both horizontaly and verticaly.\n\nThe following picture are more photo of the installation on the back, right side and a bit of the front.\n\nNext up is picture from the left side (parking) with 2 window and an orange BMW GTR RC in the window We can see how dirty the wall is and the remaining of the old fondation tape seal still on (the corner is right next to the backyard window). There's also a second chimney there for an old oil furnace. Other picture showing the said corner. The other 2 picture with the silofoam is the front and right side. We can see on both how dirty the wall is just in front of the resisto seal. On the front one, we can clearly see even the fondation isn't cleared and how undeep the ground is around the footing.\n\nAfter it's more picture of everything installed, then how dirty everything is around my house. At one time, we can see that the grass of my neighboor was protected (after damage). I put that there myself to try to minimize the remaining of the damage.\n\nAfter, we can see a part of the installation. I had to go out for 3 hours, I asked for them to not fill anything while I was gone, but they didn't listen. When I came back, I found out they already had fill the hole with 3/4 rocks, the drain and fill it up. As we can see on the forst picture showing the right side of the house partially filled, the drain sit on top of the delta MS way above the footing. In fact, it's sitting on the footing (on it's side with some rocks between him and the delta-ms). The next picture show the same installation on the left side of the house (with the water exit on the wall). We can clearly see how high the drain is compared to the footing on the bottom left. We can also see two other thing: There is nearly no rock on the side and top of the drain but also, where is the geotextile wrapping that's suppose to be there (and on contract)? They told me there is one under the rock and on the wall near the dirt, but not on top (even if that was on contract). They told me they forgot it, will credit me and put it on the remaining of the drain. I also ask them about the drain installation since, by my research on the RBQ website and NRC-CNRC (construction code for canada), that's not how it's suppose to be installed. They told me they always do it like that without any problem. I argue, told them by any logic, there's no way this will protect any water infiltration since, first, the water coming from under will rise, attack the footing first then, after sometime, reach the drain, while the drain is suppose to be reached first. And second, since the footing is wrapped with delta-ms and the drain sit on top of the delta-ms, the water coming from under the house and on the side will reach the delta-ms, be pushed inside to the footing and never reach the drain, making it more useless. But they refused to listen.\n\nAs for the chimney, instead of removing the old drain under it, they left it there and wrap the drain around the chimney (that is higher then the footing). They told me they won't go under risking to collapse the chimney. This mean the portion of the footing under the chimney is not protected.\n\nThe next picture show how well they prep the wall for the seal and the isolofoam installation, removing nearly nothing of the old tape seal, spreading the seal on a wet and dirty wall.\n\nAfter, we see the Delta-MS around my fireplace chimey. They didn't knew how to do it so they wrapped some sheet on the corner, clearly against maker recommandation. We after see the left corner in my backyard with a ripped delta-ms sheet on top and on ground. We also see at this place that the delta-ms was cut to high thus not reaching properly the footing (and it's also ripped at the footing).\n\nLittle birdy feeding her children...\n\nThe next picture show them trying to fix the broken piping. At first, they wanted to just put a new one with a cut side close shut with electric tape. I strongly refused, electric tape isn't water seal and not made to be burried underground. I told them the juice is off and we just have to fish the cable out. They did that and badly installed the new piping. The curbed near the house is too tigh, putting a lot of pressure on the joint. We'll see the result of that later. While wee see that, we can see on the wall without the isolofoam the old fondation tape seal around the corner going under the isolofoam. We also see it's not very sticky, full of dirt and the wall is so clean....\n\nIn the same photo, we can see the bottom of the hole is now full of rocks, there's no more water and we can't see the footing anymore. The drain isn't installed yet. Also, the rock is installed, but not the delta-MS, meaning the remaining here won't have any covering from the delta-MS.\n\nNext picture, we see he was out of Delta-MS so he installed something else, without asking me. Even if it's equivalent, I paid for Delta-MS and it's my contract. It suppose to be the samething all the way. The picture also show how he fixed both covering. He filled the gap between them with tar. We can clearly see that it doesn't hold in place.\n\nAfter, we can see the drain installed on the last remaining side. It's cleary way up and not covered with either rocks or geotextile, only dirt.\n\nThe remaning picture show how he filled the hole he dug. As you can see, he filled the hole with everything he dug and found, which mean: dirt, rocks, paved stone, old ceramic drain, old ceramic plastic drain (don't know where's it's coming from), styrofoam... He didn't removed the ther 2 slab of cement in the ground (while I did ask for it). He removed a lot of big stone (and make me paid for the removing of them because he dumped them at a place for that he said).\n\nNext stop is the installation of the window edge. At first, he was installing the drain for the edge directly connected to the fondation drain. I showed to him it's not a good installation and per code, he isn't suppose to do that. That's why he finally installed me two other piping for inspection (he said normally he use the edge for that). There are the two left most on the left window (yeah, installed at the same place). Even this, at first, he was installing them in reverse. Instead of making a U connection at the botton, it was goung opposite side. We can also see that the Delta-MS isn't properly fixed on the wall, there's a lot of place where's it's not tight on the wall.\n\nThe other two picture are a light he broke and the fence he broke. He did replace the light and repaired the fence.\n\nNext picture show the parking and the side of my neighboor. The grass was partially replaced with new one.\n\nAfter we see the filling. The filling is flush with the house, meaning that once it has collapse, it's not leveled at all. He told me because he removed. The ground was partially leveled, but the ground is filled with old ceramic drain piping, extra materials, metal materials, paving stone, styrofoam, etc. This is all around the filled hole and on the ground. They also make me a small place with rocks so it's easier to get to my pool.\n\nAfter we see the edge installed and the inspection chimney.\n\nThe next 3 picture show the water infiltration starting the next day after a rain.\n\nI decided to make a test. I started pooring water over the ground so water would go to the drain and check if it's working. After about an hour, I found out my basement was full of water (see next 2 pictures). The water was coming from somewhere else so I panic (nothing from where there was water infiltration before). I found out the water was coming from the underground piping. On my wall (forgot to take picture...) there was water, mud and insect coming from the ground through my wall. I called my contractor to told them it was broken.\n\nThe next picture show a bit of the floor that fall because of the water. It was expected. They told me that when that happened, it broke the piping. They came back, excaved the ground around the piping to find it broken. They recap it the same way while I was telling them it will broke again is not made properly. They told me to wait a day, then fill a bit, water it down, then fill (etc.) to remove the change of big wait break everything. The next picture show the ground after they filled it back after repairing the broken pipe. At the sametime, they also put some cement at the joint of the fondation and the footing, telling me it would solved the problem. The owner of the compagny keep telling me the problem was the chimney, not the drain. They wanted to ciment a footing on the chimney. The chimney is kind of far though. When digging the whole to do all of that, they didn't protect anything (why protect something they scrapped) and they filled without leveling. Now, all of the 3/4 rock I had between my house and pool is gone underground.\n\nI had holded the last payment because I was saying the job was badly done and nothing was fixed. After this day, they told me I would get sued over so I decided to pay. While talking with one of the guy, he told me that if I want the job done like i want (correctly), I would have to pay another 5000-6000$ for the time. I refused, arguing it's stupid since it's job is badly done. I paid the last part of the job. The owner of the shop told me he give me a 25 years warranty for the job. A week after, I got another water infiltration and he told me the problem is the chimney and that i'll cost me to repair it, refusing to say the problem is the drain installation.\n\nWe had after that about 1 month without any rain. After that, we had some shitty weather with lots of heavy rain falling without any water infiltration. I asked him if the problem was with water infiltration from the chimney up or under, never had any information. For me, since we are in summer, water under the house have lowered and the rain isn't enough to raise above the footing, thus why I'm not getting anything inside. For me, the problem come when the water under the house rise, and the next time I'll be able to check that is next spring.\n\nWe can also see that the \"Delta-MS\" (black stuff on the wall) is hold in place with a resisto-seal tape. This, didn't hold. They did that everywhere there was a joint or a crack on the delta-ms. Nothing hold.\n\nThe next pictures show how they made the joint. They installed the molding strip that came with the Delta-MS (I think) and put some tar on top of it. But, as the picture show, the wall wasn't cleaned before applying the tar. Because of that, the tar cracked and didn't hold at vaious place. They came many time to fix this, as some other picture show with some strip of tar applied with a gun in the crack showed, but it never hold.\n\nThe remaining picture are photo I took about 2 months after showing the ground. We can see on these pictures all the stuff they left on the ground (and in if we don't count what we don't see). Orange stuff are ceramic piping from old drain, black stuff are flexible black drain, plastic drain tubbing, nails, geotextile remainings...\n\nAfter we can see the corner of the chimey. As you can see, the corner is ripped and a resisto seal tape was used to \"fix\" it. They finally put nail in the molding on top of the delta-ms, as we can see on the next tw picture. But still, the molding and the delta-ms isn't tight to the wall and the tar doesn't hold.\n\nThe next picture show another big patch of resisto seal tape used to cover a ripped delta-ms.\n\nNext pictures show other place here the tar doesn't hold or were they patched with resisto seal tape delta-ms again.\n\nRemaining picture show stuff I found in the grass, like metal rod that was holding old antenna (that they removed), wood, ceramic (Etc.). The front of the house, like the back, is full of rocks too and not flatted/leveled like it should (the level was nearly just ok the first time but when they got back to repair the back, they didn't level anything). Because of that, no way I can cut the weeds (no more grass everywhere), that's why it's looking like that.\n\nThere's another picture in there showing the edge on the fron Window. We can clearly see that the edge is not close to the wall and have rocks stuck between it and the wall. Also, this specific edge doesn't even have nail on the bottom.\n\nThe last picture show how the terrain look like right now. It doesn't seems that bad because of the weed, but it's very hazardous. I denied my kid to go there and in the backyard because one of them already hurt himself walking on a ceramic piping. Nothing serious, but still, I don't take any chance.\n\nAs for the pile of woodscrap in the front, the city cut the tree in front and didn't clean the place. They are suppose to come finish the job.\n\nI sent them a formal notice requesting them to either reimburse me or pay the bill for the remaking of the installation and cleaning of the ground. They told me I was making false accusation and they'll do the drain again.\n\nI've replied saying that if they wan't to redo the job, while I'm not very open to the idea, they have to respect a list of criteria and stuff to do. This inclued to redo the whole resisto seal (liquid one) with a proper cleaning and removal of old seal tape, installing new isolofoam (can use the same if undamaged or unsoak), installing properly while using recommendation from maker of the dela-ms covering while replacing teared sheet, installing properly the drain on the side of the footing, under the level of it so it drain the water before reaching the footing, installing the missing geotextile, putting the 18\" of 3/4 rocks properly on top and bottom, cleaning excaved ground so the filling doesn't contain any bad stuff like ceramic tubbing, styrofoam (etc.), cleaning the ground where they didn't excaved and didn't protect so it's on clear black top soil and grass with everything leveled. I'm 5 days out of 10 in the countdown, I'm pretty sure he won't accept.\n\nNow, this hole big post is about: Am I right that this installion, when checking these picutre, is a big mess badly done? I'm probably going to court against the contractor and I'd like some input on that job. He says everything is right done by the code and laws, but that's not what I read. Right now I wanted to have an engineer to come to my house and verify, but they quote me about 2000$ and I'm running short on cash. Before wasting money on an engineer, would be great to be sure.\n\nThank you",

    "text": "Viability of working reduced hours (advice request) Hey all, \n\nI'm a graduate working in a small consultancy - we've got a small but great team of around 20 people, including the CEO. \n\nMy issue is that we work 8-5, and that extra hour in the morning seems to really take a lot out of the day. I'll complete my first year with the company soon, and instead of asking for a raise, I'm considering asking instead to work 9-5. \n\nI don't know if I'm just being a whiny youngster, but it feels like having that extra time would allow me to be happier outside of work (more time with friends in evenings or more time in the mornings to work on side projects), and as a result, be more focused in work. I genuinely think I'd get more done if things were like this. \n\nThere's also a lot of data to back up how much more efficient less working hours can be (with some contries placing maximum weekly hours laws of 30/35). \n\nIts worth noting that my boss is very old school, and got to where he is by putting in insane amounts of work throughout his lifetime - so on quite the opposite end of the spectrum. \n\nJust wanted to know if anyone has ever done this within engineering companies, and if it worked out for you.

    "text": "Should I stay or should I go? Hello,\nLast year, i was considering leaving \"ABC\", for company \"XYZ\". My hourly position at ABC involved 50% travel, and i knocked the wife up with twins. I told them i could not travel anymore, and after discussing position options, ABC management said i would have to take a pay cut of 15K, because i would not travel anymore.\nI immediately looked for another job in the same field, due to the pay cut, and found a position at XYZ. It is in the same field as ABC, and around the same size. It is also 35 minutes closer to my home than ABC (an hour away).\n\nI negotiated very well with XYZ, and was ready to start in 3 weeks. When i submitted a resignation letter to ABC, with a 3 week notice, ABC management made a VERY enticing counter offer which led me to stay their. I negotiated one day a one day a week work from home with ABC, a 70k salary position, bonus, and a yearly bonus. I love the team members and culture at ABC, and have many out of work friends. I've worked at ABC for 3.5 years.\n\nFor the last year i have been working (full time) partial positions at ABC as \"Customer Service\". This includes automation quality control inspections and qualification, new order machinery scope documentation (Applications), customer run off of automation, The tracking of ALL production timelines, initial customer new order support, coordinating all the shipping of machinery, and formalizing project timelines for customer review. The VP at ABC keeps telling me different ideas for the position i will settle down in, but ultimately I've been doing odd positions. The VP at ABC changes his thoughts on this every week, and i am building uncertainty with my future (maybe just paranoia). He speaks highly of me, so i am flattered to even be considered for positions I have little to no experience in. He has told me that he trusts me, and divulges a lot of sensitive business issues with me for my opinions / brainstorming. With a family and mortgage, the uncertainty has me worried.\n\nXYZ company called me last week (After over a year) and told me of a director level position they want me for. I guess I had left an impression on XYZ ownership to consider me for this, especially after backing out from a position before. I had lunch with the XYZ again today to understand the scope of the position.\n\nI know i can do the director position at XYZ, and a trust in the owner of the company and what he says. The director position is opening up because the owner is currently doing the position, and will step up to fill the shoes of the VP that is retiring. He is in need of someone to improve the service department which is need of reform, so it will be a difficult position. I feel my entire career at ABC has built up the skill set to do the job at XYZ.\n\nMy biggest hang ups for leaving ABC are my co-workers and culture. It is a small company that is very family oriented. They treat customers wonderfully, and demonstrate alot of integrity on their behalf. If i were to stay, i think eventually I would settle into a great position. I also have a great mentor in the VP at ABC, who is teaching me about business and its problems. The health benefits are also second to none in the area.\n\nI am considering leaving ABC because I've had to fight for salary promises before, and I've received 1.5 -2.5% raises on Excellent performance reviews. I know haters are always out their, but I've encountered dialogue of some engineering peers not calling position legitimate, and that is a gut shot. Also, I am one of the rare instances of not having any formal degrees, yet having a great job, so if a huge opportunity comes my way I give it thought.\n\nI am trying to consider a good salary to justify the move. I am going to request 110k, 10k signing bonus, and 5 years seniority. The position nationally averages 87k a year, but if they really want me, they will have to pay. I would haggle to 100k, 10k signing bonus if they had push back. If anyone has input on how to approach the negotiations, i would love it. I've always been hourly up to last year, and upper management negotiations are new to me.\n\nI think that long term, having director on my resume would be help me immensely. I never had a problem switching positions either.\n\nTL:DR Considering moving from a \"renaissance man\" style position applications engineer with prospects, to service director position in a new company.",

    "text": "Best chances of success: put all cards on the table or incremental negotiation? I wish to negotiate a change in my employment status from Full-time telecommute worker to Part-time telecommute contractor. The purpose of changing work agreements is so I can travel whist working and work for other businesses. There are about 5 critical things I would like to negotiate (see list below). \n   \n&nbsp;   \n- **Negotiation Goal 1:** Change work agreement from full-time to part-time employee or contractor.    \n- **Negotiation Goal 2:** Work a minimum of 20 hours a week (sometimes more but never less). I want this to be stated in my contract.  \n- **Negotiation Goal 3:** The worker cannot be dismissed without written notice. Must be given at least 2 weeks notice. Can be dismissed for any reason.  \n- **Negotiation Goal 4:** The worker can work for other businesses. But not competitors.    \n- **Negotiation Goal 5:** Work European timezone hours. I plan to move to Europe (from Australia where I am employed).  \n   \n&nbsp;   \n\n**Should I state all my negotiation goals in the first meeting** - put all my cards on the table. Or should I select 2/3 main goals and incrementally ask for the others in successive talks?  \n\n---\n   \n&nbsp;   \n**Context:**  \nI am a Systems Engineer in Australia and the company is a small 'start-up' (<10 people) with an even smaller IT department (2 people).\n   \n&nbsp;   \n**Incentives I can offer:**  \n- The employer does not pay super annuation (SA) for the worker. In Australia SA is similar to a 401k - the employer pays 9% of your income directly into your retirement fund. This is quite expensive for employers and a hastle.  \n- The worker works remotely and provides *most equipment to perform their job (laptop, internet) themself.  \n- Payment given hourly, weekly, monthly or salary (dont care).  \n   \n&nbsp;   \n**'Leverage':**  \nWhilst I dont feel quite comfortable thinking in this transactional nature, I do believe that my business value allows me to negotiate from a position of strength.   \n- It takes a while to find another employee with my skillset   \n- If I leave it would affect the ability of the business to meet project deadlines already in progress.  \n- My employment role has deviated significantly from what was verbally stated (contractually it a gray area). Ie, I was told multiple times I would be the GM's 'right hand man' for software development but this changed literally the first week I started with the company. My point is, due to the breaking of the GM's word I believe I have no moral or ethical obligation to consider the possible negative impact of my departure on the business.  \n- I am prepared to resign if I am unable to negotiate a favourable change. \n   \n&nbsp;   \n*Software required to code a project the company should purchase.

    "text": "I was fired from my first programming position, went through unemployment, now I work at a Big N. Some advice for people who are \"worried\" Bio Plug: Graduated with non CS engineering degree from a high ranking school. Hated the field once I worked in it. Visited a friend who was working at a growing SAAS company, now works at Amazon. Loved the environment. Younger people, happy, always new stuff talked about. Studied programming on my own. Passed an interview test, they realized they needed someone more experienced two weeks after I started and fired me after I spent my savings relocating. I was devastated.  \nI've also gone through working at a start-up who VC's pulled out from, working at a contractor that started firing veteran employees because management lost a 7 figure contract and now I work at a Big N.  \nHere's my advice for the people going through the following stressful situations/tragedies -  \n**TLDR Advice -  \nFor job hunters:  \n1. Send out as many applications as you can, even to positions you don't qualify for and the ones you match the most, pay more attention to.  \n2. Try to divide your time between accomplishable studying goals and applying.  \n3. Be willing to relocate even if you have family, close friends, SO.  \n4. Relax and don't blame yourself.  \nFor those working that are worried or wondering if there's problems:  \n1. Got a bad feeling in your gut? Listen to it.  \n2. There's nothing wrong with putting a value on loyalty.  \n3. Communicate with your boss when you're unhappy, albeit professionally.**  \nDetailed -  \n**For those trying to get a first job, that seem to never see the end of rejections**:  \n1. Send out as many applications as you can, even to positions you don't qualify for and the ones you match the most, pay more attention to.  \nI sent out *hundreds* of applications. And when I found a position I really matched, I made the application as personal as I can, often naming the engineering manager in my email, pointing out my knowledge about tech they use and discussing their portfolio directly and relating it to my knowledge.  \nIt sucks when you make an application personal and they don't acknowledge you, but it's worthwhile experience learning to talk about the tech for future interviews and it *also* sucks for them, to turn down someone who made things so personable.  \n2. Try to divide your time between accomplishable studying goals and applying. Pick an MOOC, and ONE only, and spend half your time applying to jobs and the other half on conquering that MOOC. Don't even LOOK at other classes on Coursera until that MOOC is finished and you've completed the final project.  \nI did a complete book on a platform I know, and I even did an iTunes University course on DS&algorithms. I never moved on until I finished one.  \nBy the time I started my first real job after being fired, I had finished 5 courses and knew the in's and out's of my platform enough to talk about it in regular conversation.  \n3. Be willing to relocate. Some of you have family, or a girlfriend, or a close group of friends. I'm sorry to tell you this, but you are more of a burden to them than help if you're unemployed especially in the US. The US is harsh and brutal to people unemployed. More so nowadays than before.  \nIf you relocate, get a job in a low COL, you can save money for plane tickets, fly your SO to come see you, learn more about the world outside of what you know and get experience to come back later.  \nI really wanted to work in my college city, so badly that I was willing to take a 20% cut in pay under market rate to do it. That would've been a massive mistake.  \nNow, I get job offers for my college city 20 to 30% above what I earn now because I've earned experience and I'm in demand.  \nI've lived in three different cities after I graduated because I kept going where the work is.  \nYou would be surprised what a company will do for you if you're the best person for the job that they can afford. Early termination lease fees, rental truck, plane ticket, crate for your dog, groceries and beer money for two weeks? Done.  \nIt's true that my first job fired me, I'll talk about that soon. But the next three companies? Hired me, helped me move, took care of my expenses.  \n4. Relax and don't blame yourself. No, you're not a shitty programmer. No, you're not \"worthless\" compared to your friend who got hired by Facebook pre-graduation.  \nThere are literally *thousands* of alumni and bootcamp graduates just like you having trouble getting placed. A lot of companies want Gilfoyle at McDonald's employee prices and it's showing. Companies think that if they hold out enough, they can get some guy who passes all their HackerRank tests who will be okay with $50,000 a year and be grateful because the economy sucks.  \nIn reality, they're just going to sit around with a job posting for programmers and complain that engineers ask for too much money. Forget about those places, you wouldn't want to work there anyway.  \nFocus on the companies that can afford you and deserve you.  \nBut take time after a busy day of applying and studying to just relax. Go to a friend's house, watch some movies, do yoga, play your favorite game and turn off messages and emails for an hour while you do it. This job is stressful and if you build in this sense of urgency and panic and engrain it too much, you will have trouble relaxing in the future and put yourself at risk for very serious heart conditions.  \n**For those who have a job and are unsure about going for something else, how safe their office is or worried about getting fired**:  \n1. Got a bad feeling in your gut? Listen to it.  \nIs there a guy/girl that works with you that acts like you should never complain about management, work is work and management never does anything wrong?  \nYeah, fuck that guy. That guy is an idiot and in a year or two, you'll be twilights and galaxies ahead of him/her in your career because they would sit around on the titanic playing the violin while you're clawing your way into a life raft.  \nThere's *NOTHING* wrong with listening to your gut. It doesn't mean you're going to quit if you start asking serious questions and start wondering what's going on with the weather forecast.  \nMy first company was a start-up. At a certain point, I noticed the founders would go into meeting rooms and not invite any of us. I got a little worried so I started asking my PM for meetings and asking my mentor if I should be worried.  \nMy coworker on another platform kept saying, \"Dont' worry about it we just need to do our job\". Total company man.  \nI decided it's better to be safe than sorry and it's better to have job offers I can turn down than be in the middle of the woods with explosive diarrhea and not a tissue in sight.  \nSo I started putting out feelers with recruiters, I took on five interviews and I had four hard offers for local companies, all at a minimum of $5,000 over my current salary.  \nAt the end of that month, founders dragged us all into a meeting room and told us they lost funding and half of us were gonna be fired and they wanted the engineers to work pro-bono for a few weeks on like a \"salary IOU\" while they try to package up our platform and sell it.  \nCompany man next to me? He had the same look on his face that my friends had when we walked out of a hard calculus 3 final that they bombed and I talked through all my solutions in confidence because the questions were exactly like the ones I got in TA hours, that they skipped because of how much smarter than me they were.  \nLuckily for that asshole, who treated me like shit because I wanted to cover my ass, I actually gave his information \"anonymously\" to the same recruiter who placed me and told her, \"Hit him up and be persistent, he's a good coder he just doesn't see the writing on the walls\". My recruiter landed him a position and to this day he doesn't know how the recruiter found him.  \n2. There's nothing wrong with putting a value on loyalty.  \n[This is what I have to say about loyalty, per Dwight Schrute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QWsTBvXx_g). Care about you and you only.  \nLike your boss? Like your office? Say things like, \"I don't want another job because unlike you guys, I commit to the place I work\". Let me ask you this, will your boss come to your house and carry you to the bathroom when you're retired? Will your boss drive you to pick up groceries when your car breaks down?  \nYour company, in the US, only cares about you as much as your value proceeds the worth of your compensation and training. Once those values do not align, *the clock is ticking and you will likely be fucked over soon*. That's the advantage \"at will\" employment gives them.  \nThey can fire you and unless they tell you publicly, \"I'm firing you because of the color of your skin\", you likely have very little recourse to correct it.  \nAnd they can literally fire you with less than 24 hours notice.  \nYour lifestyle? Dependent on your salary? Unemployment insurance is likely a fraction of that amount, so firing you can literally put your life and livelihood in danger.  \nAlways have a back up plan even if you don't feel like your company is in danger.  \nSpeak to recruiters, build relationships with other companies in your cities. Always have someone or some company who thinks, \"Man, it'd be nice to have code_4_you here working with us, let's see how he/she is doing\". Those connections are your natural parachutes and help you to not have to relocate again.  \n3. Communicate with your boss when you're unhappy, albeit professionally.  \nThere is nothing wrong with not being sure about what you're doing. Sometimes your boss won't even know there's something wrong. A lot of managers, albeit this is a mistake and any managers reading should pay attention to this and not do it, don't tell their engineers the small combination of words that will make over 40% of them feel happy and STOP looking for new jobs -  \n\"You're doing great, we're really glad to have you here, this is some of the stuff we have planned next year for you.\"  \nThat's it. Literally 8 seconds of English words and your engineers will feel safe, secure and stop hitting up your competitors for back-up plans.  \nThat's what my boss said to me two months ago, and now I'm working the longest streak at one company of my career.  \nIf you don't feel that way, tell your boss, because this paper trail gives you the defense you need to show that you DID try to communicate your dissatisfaction. And it's possible they will try to remedy it by changing your project, putting you under a new senior or offering you some extra PTO to sort things out.  \nMy story:  \nAdapt is the theme of my experience. I was fired, I adapted. I got a job and had a bad feeling about the VC's/founders, I adapted. I got hired by a contractor and had a feeling there was toxicity in upper level management, finally felt ready to work for a Big N, I adapted.  \nNow I love what I do and I'm highly valuable.  \nGood luck out there!  \nOh and if anyone tries to convince you that we don't deserve these six figure salaries or earning more money than most of their clerical staff/management and tries to say, \"This market isn't sustainable, software engineers are asking too much and companies bleed trying to hire them\", tell them to fuck off.  \nThat's not how economics work.  \nWe are in such demand that literally other countries are trying to fly us out of the country and offering us crazy immigration and visa conditions to get us to go there.  \nThis is a software driven world and it's only going to get better. Self driving cars, smart underwear, more powerful phones... All this shit needs engineering. If you don't want to pay for a good engineer, buy a Safari Books subscription or build a fucking Wordpress site.  \nI'm sick of these red pill, economics/management science graduates trying to sneak into /r/CSCareerQuestions and trying to neg us down because they failed to hit their hiring quota for their \"IT\" department, because a UCLA CS graduate didn't want to accept their \"excellent\" offer of $55,000 a year to build their Enterprise Tinder clone or whatever shit idea they think they know more about than us.",

    "text": "Junior SWE in crisis I don't really know if this level of intensity is appropriate for this subreddit, but I thought I'd give it a shot.\n\nJust some background: I'm mid 20's, have an undergrad computer science/software engineering degree from a mid-tier university and have been an SWE at a small company (<20 employees) for a little over a year. I am by far the youngest and least experienced employee at the company.\n\nFor the most part, I have enjoyed my job. Without going into specifics, I have been fortunate enough to work on a wide range of components of a couple of projects within a small team. However, over the past two months I have struggled with feelings of self doubt and incompetence which have led to me questioning my career choice.\n\nI am familiar with impostor syndrome, but I'm not sure if it applies here. While I believe I'm quite competent with some aspects of the role, I struggle to understand others and feel completely useless and stupid in technical discussions and can't really hold my own. Perhaps I should ask more questions, but I feel like such questions would be stupid and laughable given how elementary they would be with respect to the discussion.\n\nIn addition to this, the lead of the project is (in my opinion) a horrible developer. I know it sounds a little ridiculous to express my own feelings of incompetence and then call someone else out for the same thing, but hear me out. He seems to have an excellent, in-depth knowledge of many concepts involved in the project and is regarded as a great engineer (particularly hardware), but his actual code is an absolute nightmare to deal with.\n\nIt's not scalable or portable in any way, he seems to have no concept of software architecture and he doesn't conform to any sort of coding conventions. It's all incredibly messy and inconsistent. Functions are far too long and call on code from low/no layers of abstraction or libraries that they shouldn't. Chunks of code are commented out all over the place. Indentation is inconsistent (sometimes spaces, sometimes tabs, no regards for alignment). Header files are a mess and some files may as well just #include \"everything.h\". Obviously compilation is slow, and there are warnings all over the place. I saw a line of code the other day that read \"if (foo == someEnumEqualToZero) foo = 0;\" - still trying to work this one out.\n\nFurthermore, his form of source code management involves creating an archive, uploading it to a shared directory and having me extract it and merge it with the main code base. I maintain the public repository  for the project and have a separate branch just for his code dumps to help me deal with this. I have tried to teach him how to use Git but he'll just always switch back to his old ways within a day.\n\nWhile you might suggest I just talk to him about these issues (and I have brushed on some of them in a very reasoning and diplomatic way), he is the most stubborn, intense man I have ever met and will be quick to assume it's due to my incompetence or lack of understanding of a concept. And while this is a valid issue as I explained earlier, 90% of the time my difficulties are the result of his code rather than the concepts they implement. It's not uncommon for him to set me a task which involves some code he wrote and then become irritated when I modify his code to be more portable/scalable (which I do simply because it wasn't going to work any other way). If this happens it's rare that my changes will still be present in his next code dump. I find it more and more difficult to speak up about these issues and have just adapted my workflow to deal with it. I get the feeling that he has never worked on a team software project before...\n\nI think this toxic environment is possibly a cause of my feelings of incompetence and lately has driven me as far as depression and anxiety. Lately I have spent hours staring at the screen just wondering how I'm possibly meant to complete a task with the mess that has been created with all things above considered, and it drives me absolutely insane. As a junior SWE it's certainly not ideal for my professional development. However, there aren't many opportunities for SWEs in my area, and leaving the job after only one year of experience would most likely be career suicide and a waste of 5+ years of my life (including study). In saying all this, if dealing with these issues is common among all engineers then I'm unsure if I'm even cut out for this career.\n\nI've organised a meeting with another engineer/manager and HR to discuss these issues, but if anyone has any advice or thoughts on this issue, it would be much appreciated.",

    "text": "Am I in an objectively bad situation or am I being petty? tl;dr I really dislike the company I work for and the job I'm doing but I'm not sure if it's me or the company.\n\nFirst things first. Throwaway account and vague'ish content so that hopefully I won't be recognized and I won't break any NDA stuff. There are two reasons I'm posting this here. 1) I wanted to write this out because usually when I do that with my problems it helps me get a different perspective on the issue. Makes me really think about it. I can do that without reddit, though which brings me to the second reason. 2) I have no professional experience so I can't adequately judge whether or not I'm being petty. It's possible that this is standard for the industry and I'll have to just get over it.\n\nI'm hoping you lot can provide some insight. So, onto the situation.\n\n---\n**THE INTRODUCTION**\nI learned about this company during a career fair hosted by my college. I didn't even go up to talk to them, because I didn't know who they were. Their rep pulled me out of the crowd because they saw my nametag said Computer Science Senior. I talked to them for a brief period and afterwards gave them my resume just so that I could hit as many places as possible for a job (although I already knew I wasn't really interested in the job). After chatting, the rep wanted me to sign up for an on campus interview, which I did because again, I needed a job. \n\n**THE INTERVIEW**\nBefore I went to the interview, I still wasn't very enthused about the position. Partly because it would mean I'd be a consultant (I'd still be a software engineer, but the company would basically be a middle man between me and whatever company they end up hiring me out to), partly because I knew (via Glassdoor) that their starting pay was a fair bit less than I wanted, especially for the area, and partly because the job just didn't sound fun. Anyway, the interview was 15-20 minutes long and consisted of half HR-styled questions and half vocab questions. I did not get a single coding question. For a software engineering role. What? On top of that, I did horribly. Vocab-type knowledge has never been my strong suit. I thought for sure there was no chance they would call me back for another interview, which was fine. Lo and behold, about a month later they called me to say they were offering me the job. Not a follow up interview... a job.\n\n**THE OFFER**\nThe initial offer had me posted in the area I wanted to be in with a starting salary that was actually a grand or two less than what was posted on Glassdoor. Also the start date was a month post-graduation and they had a mandatory 6-month training program on the other side of the country. With the training program, the offer was an easy decline for me. I did not want to spend 6 months on the opposite coast away from every single person I know in this world. I didn't decline it at first, though. I just let it sit while I applied elsewhere. A week or two later they came back and said they changed the training plan down to 6 weeks instead of 6 months. It would've been 2 weeks opposite coast, 3 weeks back home, and 1 more week opposite coast. It was no longer an easy decline. It would still suck, but it'd be manageable. A couple days later, they contacted me again to say they'd increased my potential salary by about 6% and pushed my start date back by an additional month. I didn't ask for the raise, they just offered it. (This brought me up to just slightly over the Glassdoor price.) Deadline approaching, no other interviews, much less job offers, so I accepted. Then a week before I left for the training program, they emailed me to say the training program had been changed again so now it'd be 8 weeks, all of which would be on the opposite coast. It sucked and I hated it but I'd already accepted and I had no where else to go.\n\n**THE TRAINING**\nFor the 8 weeks, they put us (a group of like 20'ish CS, business, and other majors) in a hotel. They payed for the hotel costs, but food and any transportation was on us. (That's another thing they changed. Initially they were going to cover lunch 5 days a week and dinner 4 days a week, but in the last email they said they would only be covering hotel costs.) First two weeks were all HR related things. Benefits, harrassment stuff, company background, etc. During this portion, they were going over IP and NDA content and they said that anything we create, even if it's on our own time and using our own personal technology, will be owned by them. This killed any motivation I had to work on fun projects outside of work. The following 6 weeks were them \"teaching\" us the relevant technologies for the projects we'd be going to. It was not organized at all. We had no trainer onsite. We had to join a low quality, overseas call every morning to get lectured for about an hour or two. Post lecture we'd be given programs to work on to practice the technologies previously talked about. The programs they had us make to learn the technologies were all intro level programs. Maybe slightly harder than \"Hello World!\" but not by much. Because of this, my group and I spent like 90% of our days doing nothing or doing leetcode challenges while we waited for some new direction. I ended up leaving the training at the end of the 8 weeks feeling no more prepared for the job than when I went in.\n\n**THE JOB**\nI was posted to a high-tech company, which was rather exciting at first. Basically the only thing thus far that I was excited about. However, even though I explicitly said I didn't want to do test, I was put into a test role. Again, I had no other options so I figured I'd just do it. Maybe it'd turn out to be fun and if not, supposedly you're supposed to switch jobs semi-frequently when you initially start your career anyway. Turns out I hate it. It's been causing me a fair bit of stress. The last time I dreaded getting out of bed this much was back when I was being bullied in high school. Also, my company basically wants me to give my life completely to them. I usually work 9 hours days, with a couple 10 hour days here and there, which is mostly fine. However, now they want me to work Saturdays as well. It is too much for me, especially for the pay I'm at.\n\n---\nI've been employed by this company for a little over 3 months now, although I've only been working on a project for about a month. I hate it enough, though, that I'm considering starting to apply elsewhere already. What's stopping me, mostly, is that I don't really have any new experience as compared to when I graduated, and I don't want to apply to places only to get declined. Then I would be stuck here longer while I wait for the ambiguous grace period to end so I can apply to the same places again. One issue that's entirely on my end is I want to stay in the area I'm at. I'm sure I'd have more opportunities if I were to look elsewhere in the country but for personal reasons, I'm mildly rooted here. \n\nShould I apply anyway and take my chances? Or am I going to end up equally unhappy at the next place? Or should I try to wait a little while longer so I have more experience?\n\nEdit: I appreciate your responses thus far. I'm actually at work now so I won't really be able to respond. I've only logged in now to make sure you're aware that I haven't abandoned the post. When I get home tonight I'll try to address some points that have been brought up.\n\nEdit2: Thanks again for your comments. It seems the general consensus is that I'm in a bad spot and I should fix things on my end and then try to get out. My plan at this point is to spend the next month'ish doing leetcode/hackerrank questions in my evenings to reacquaint myself with interview questions. After that I'll start applying and trying to get out of my company.",

I have one internship whose official title is \"Biometrics Engineering Intern.\"  I did work in computer vision using MATLAB and C++.  Is this not considered relevant experience for entry level SDE roles?  Should I alter the internship title to \"Biometrics *Software* Engineering Intern\" although that is not quite the official name (though in terms of content of the internship, I have zero guilt in doing this because I was indeed writing code from scratch)?\n\nOr am I in trouble because employers for general entry level SDE jobs really want to see web development skills and it's obvious that I know nothing about web development (Languages I have listed are:  Java, Python, C/C++, MATLAB, R)?  My only projects are a DB course project from school using Oracle and some predictive analytics projects involving machine learning.  For the latter, yes I am leaning on libraries like sklearn and do not expect to get anything close to a real data science job with them, but they are finished products and should IMO be better than nothing (esp. for a fresh grad), no?\n\nBasically, the free time I spent on ML MOOC's and Kaggle-like projects appears to have been a complete waste of my time because it's obviously not anywhere near good enough to sniff data science jobs without experience with higher math and BIG/messy data sets (not to mention probably need a Master's) and I should have instead used all that free time learning web development instead.  So it appears I am caught in no man's land without any kind of competency desired by employers.  Any advice for my situation?  Thanks in advance!\n\nEDIT:  I did get a return offer from my internship, but was looking to expand my options because not sure I want to stick with \"Biometrics Engineering.\"",

    "text": "Building out our startup's COO level planning, process and people architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.) Hey y'all. \n\n**Quibbl is an early stage startup.** We are trying to make a big dent in the news aggregation space by borrowing from fantasy sports adn markets to create user-sourced aggregation system that uses a competitive game like dynamic where users compete to earn credibility by correctly predicting the outcomes to news events and trends, allowing us to use credibility as the basis for crowd sourcing. \n\nCheck it out. Quibbl.me - go make your bets on Game of Thrones, ACHA & sports stuff\n\n\n**Fair enough**\n\nWe were Y Combinator finalists this year, and though we have a long ways to go, we have been making great strides building out a top-notch tech team, going to our users and collecting massive product feedback & building out a media & content team that is beggining to produce some really cool stuff.\n\nThere's just one problem. We are growing too fast and our organizational infrastructure is a mess.\n\n**Personally, i would feel like we were in a good place if we had the following locked down:**\n\nVision:\nTeam formation & team context:\nProcesses / playbooks\nProcedures \nWorkflow management\nKnowledge library / file storage\nTalent library (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.)\n\n**However this is the current state\"**\n\n\n**Vision:** we have a pretty clear verbal roadmap, some basic power points that convey it. I think for onboarding the team and keeping people in sync at the org levle, we are pretty okay. HOWEVER, for places where the devil is in the details (the specific tradeoffs we want to make for user acquisition strategy, detailed requirements for our analytics engine and detailed product feedback requirements, those exist in various documents, are subject to interpretation and the subject of a lot of unnecessary friciton and guessing. In won't come over night, but i'd like to have a clearer book of \"standards\" (could basically function as a 10 page appendix of 1 page memos covering our \"vision standards\" to a level of granularity that reflects what's needed to make our typical business decisions and ensure good integration across teams\n\n**Team formation & team context:** as we onboard new teammembers, we have a pretty good oral process, that gives a good overview of the teams, their book of work, how they fit together etc. But it's inefficient (relies on me to tell each person what's going on in the company, and subject to me being on and their recall). Starting to flesh out the core onboarding document to give a 2-3 page overview of each team's responsibilities, current context and book of work. Meantime, trying to develop a more granular and standard questionnaire so every month i meet with a team we use it as a forcing mechanism to get everyone in sync on what we are doing and how pieces fit together.\n\n**Processes / playbooks:**  one of the biggest problems with onboarding new people is people run into walls and don't know what to do. I am the key man / only one who knows how to do a ton of things in the company, from working analytical prototypes to how to manage our social media accounts. I don't have capacity or mental energy to hand these off in a good way, and i feel like if we just had a list of the top 10 most painful processes, and an organized dashboard to start storing them down, batch by batch, we could get out of the mess. \n\n**Procedures** - see above \n\n**Workflow management** - we are putting work into the workflow system asana and that seems to help. But things get put in a non-standardized way, assignments are often incomplete or misentered. If we could get the book of procedures tight, we could that automate the workflow for most types of deliverables, which would massively reduce confusion, bottlenecking and the overhead of having to retrain people because their is no standard body of knowledge \n \n**Knowledge library / file storage** - our files are totally fucked up. So much good work, spread over so many different files, some of which have brilliant gems, but across a chaois of brainstorming that represented the last year. We scrap our document library we lose a ton of good work and criticial thinking that was done to shape our product to date (prototypes that haven't landed in our core code), procedures that are mixed in with people's personal notebooks, etc. But i lack the bandwith to go organize it all myself. If i could get an nice clean inventory of all the documents, i could start tagging, sorting them and identifying like documents taht could be sorted, organized and archived, but i need the right tool / inventory design and that takes thinking.\n  \n**Talent library** (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.) \n\nIf i could have a top down scan of my peoople, have quick and dirty weeekly metrics (who has their individual charters / responsibiilities setup, when was the last time their documents were audieted and kept to standard, are they in the right meetings, etc?) that would go such along way to get us from bad to good.\n\n**current focus:** buidling out some k level versions of these tools and populating them by end of week. That said, i can't help but think i'm not the first person to have to go build an organization from scratch. are their any good tools out there that are designed to prompt this work, capture it in an organized way, etc. etc.\n\nsome sort of template or tool that already exists in excel would be great. i know the answers, i just need a good enough tool that will put it all together and i don't want to reinvent the wheel on tired eyes\n\n\n**Any suggestions for easy templates / existing spreadsheets to build out my startup's COO level architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.)**\n\nWe have about 3 core teams, about 2-3 groups of people per team, and about 25 project contributors. This seems too complex to manage via weekly memo, without the right structure underneath it. Or at least, i'm finding i need some more structure.\n\n**Any other ideas? How would you go about solving this wonderful mess?**",

    "text": "MeToo is a game changer -- but not in the way feminists think Feminists have never been very good at predicting the future.  \n\nThey assumed feminism would increase female happiness.   Female happiness has been declining since the 70's.   \n\nThey assumed that trying to eliminate the female gender role would create rough parity in previously male dominated occupations.   In fact, in countries where women have the highest degree of choice, women are *least* likely to become engineers; conversely, countries like Iran and China lead all nations in female engineering.  \n\nThey assumed that destroying the \"patriarchal\" family would eliminate child abuse and allow children to grow up healthy and happy.   In fact, children from single mother households fare worse on all quality of life indicators.   \n\nThey assumed that domestic violence was a patriarchal conspiracy.   In fact, hundreds of studies reveal that women are more likely to engage in unilateral violence against their partners, and lesbians have the highest rates of DV.   \n\nThey assumed that women in power would be more peaceful.  In fact, studies have now revealed that Queens were more likely to initiate wars than kings.  Female leaders ranging from Margaret Thatcher to Hillary Clinton were positively eager to engage in military violence.  \n\nI could go on indefinitely.   The point is that feminists have gotten *almost everything wrong.*   It is nothing short of remarkable that they continue to dominate academic discourse on gender given their near-100 percent failure rate.   Any theory worth its salt should be somewhat predictive; feminist theory is *counter-predictive*.  In no other discipline (save perhaps economics) do we see such a disconnect from reality.   \n\nI can only conclude that the wild success of feminism owes almost entirely to what they call \"benevolent sexism.\"   Men and women in academia have been exceedingly reluctant to debunk their arguments because patriarchy theory is, in fact, horseshit: men want to support women, not oppress them.   And they will support women even when they are clearly wrong.   \n\nThat brings us to MeToo.   Collectively it is Time magazine's \"person of the year.\"   The once charming and beautiful -- now wretched -- Ashley Judd even posed for the cover photo.   \n\nFeminists have been content to see their ideology run wild.   They have wielded female power (which they bizarrely deny even exists) to brutalize men and boys.   They were fine with denying children access to their fathers, turning fathers into indentured servants,  ignoring the role that women play in domestic/sexual violence, shutting down talks on male suicide, disadvantaging boys in \"education\", discriminating against men in hiring practices, allowing false accusations to run rampant, and so on and so forth. \n\nHowever, in the last week or so, I've noticed a change in tune.   Feminists are extremely worried that \"MeToo\" may end up creating a \"blowback\" effect on women.   We're talking about bourgeois women mind you -- because that's what feminists are.  Spoiled, rich, women.    I've noticed contradictory statements in \"MeToo\" articles within single paragraphs -- NO, men shouldn't flirt with women in the workplace, but YES, men should flirt with women in the workplace (the right *kind* of man, you see).   The unspoken subtext is that women should still be permitted to use their sexual power where they see fit.   Cake and eat it too.  \n\nThere is a growing recognition that a pandora's box has been opened.   What if men start to view women as threats?   If an \"alpha\" male can be taken down over a mere accusation with no proof, what about your average man?   What about my son!?  \n\nIn fact, wouldn't it be the *responsible* thing for a man with a wife and kids to make sure there is always a chaperone present so he doesn't put his family at risk?  \n\nAll of a sudden those stodgy old Victorian rules are starting to look mighty sensible.   Maybe the sexes *should* be segregated.   Otherwise, how is a man to protect himself?  Nevermind the woman's honor, what about the man's honor?  Hell, maybe that's why such rules were created in the first place!  \n\nFeminists are incapable of thinking too far ahead -- let's just say they're not exactly grand master chess players -- but the alarm bells are already going off in their heads.   \n\nWhat if men decide not to privilege me in the workplace?  What if I can't use my sexual power over men to get ahead?  What if I have to work for a living?   \n\nI'm sympathetic toward working class women.   They didn't ask for this neo-Victorian sexual panic.   They suffer actual hardships in life -- rather than a pat on the ass.  \n\nBe that as it may, MeTOO is a game changer.   Despite what some feminists think, men do not desire to be punching bags; they will try to protect themselves.   And that means no more special goodies and privileges for women in the workplace.  Women will have to pull their weight.   That also means no more drinks, lunches, and sincere efforts by older men to give young women a leg up.  \n\nIn fact -- and I hate to sound too MGTOW about all this -- but I think MeTOO will eventually bring us back to [sex segregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjidOQgGDE) -- precisely the thing the original feminists fought against.    You abused your power ladies, and now it's time to reap the whirlwind.  \n\nFeminists are now saying, \"It's time to take a step back.\"  Too late.  You made your bed.  Now sleep in it.",

    "text": "If you’re a man with a camera, you’re automatically branded a creep I used to work semi-professionally as a photographer.  What do I mean by that?  Essentially I was part time.  I had a great job as a software engineer that I liked and didn’t want to give up, but in my off hours I liked switching gears by earning extra dollars via photography.  I specialized in taking photos of the performing arts such as musical artists, plays, circuses, etc.  It was fun.  It was a very different challenge from writing code.  \n\nSo this 16 year-old girl found my web site and liked what I saw.  She needed some quality photos for her school’s yearbook and approached me to take them.  She asked me to take photos appropriate to the yearbook.  Not once did she ever request any nudity or anything else inappropriate.  She had an after school job and enough money to pay my rates.  Everything seemed completely legit.  Of course, I was well aware of the stereotypes that would brand me some kind of sick perv if I photographed a teenage girl.  I therefore turned to other photographers for advice on putting together a contract that would protect me legally.  She wanted a photos of her together with her horse.  There would be photos of her riding it, grooming it, and just standing beside it.  Nothing wrong with that, of course.  I still wanted a contract to protect me legally so that I would not end up falsely accused of any wrongdoing.  A protective instinct kicked in because I knew how hyper-negative people get toward men, especially a man with a camera.  \n\nI asked other photographers on a photography forum online if there were some kind of standard protective contract I could use.  Some photographers responded with good advice on where I could get such a thing.  Some also said I should require at least one parent present at the shoot.  Good advice.  However, others went berserk, accusing me of being some kind of perv out to rape that girl.  One asshole claimed that if it were his daughter he would immediately contact the police and the courts and get a restraining order against me.  He acted like I had proposed to make kiddie porn.  We’re talking about a photo shoot of a fully clothed girl in normal pictures with her horse – feeding it, riding it, normal stuff.  These were photos that were appropriate to a high school yearbook.  \n\nThese male-bashing bigots totally ignored my explanation of the content of the shoot and just assumed I would ask her to take her clothes off and do pervy things and that it would end with me raping her.  No amount of setting the record straight did any good.  It was unreal the hateful assumptions people made.  Some photographers came to my defense, appalled as I was at the overreaction.  Some correctly said that photographers photograph all ages.  Duh.  It totally depends on the content of the photos as to whether it’s appropriate.  It’s unreal how some people heard “fully clothed girl riding a horse” and translated that to “perv raping a teenager.”  \n\nI ended up doing the shoot, no thanks to the male-bashing bigots.  It went great.  I had a liability contract and I had her father present at the shoot.  Great guy, and great girl.  They were awesome people.  Neither of them made any of the absurd assumptions some idiots had made.  This was a case of a young woman who had earned her own money at a job and had chosen to spend it on some high quality photos.  Nothing more.  It’s unreal how some people will twist something like that into something sick.  \n\nOther photographers have told me about similar situations where they’re assumed to be some kind of perv because they have a camera with a telephoto lens.  If you’re a man and you take a high-end camera to a beach, you risk getting pestered and even arrested by police.  That’s a reason why I won’t even do beach photography.  Nowadays, I won’t even photograph someone who’s underage unless I know the people really well.  I was lucky at this shoot that they turned out to be terrific people, but if I had gotten the witch hunt idiots, it could have been dangerous for me.  I’m 100 percent certain if I were a woman, the whole overreaction and branding me as some kind of creep or perv would never have gone down.  “Girl with her horse” – he must be a sicko.  It’s unreal.",

In the second article, where a boy posted a picture saying \"It's just as hard to be Ken as Barbie,\" the response was \"suck it up, white boy.\"\n\nWhen it comes to women, there is boundless empathy for women to be who they are and define themselves. When it comes to men and boys, it's \"sit down and shut up, because your feelings don't matter.\" \n\nNot only that, but women perpetuate the unrealistic expectations of male appearance. Men are willing to date down, and to date a variety of body types. Curvy? Sure! Slim, that's hot! Big booty? Sign me up! \n\nWomen? Not so much. Studies show women typically will not \"date down.\" So if a woman makes more than a man, chances are she will not date him. Even if he is more attractive. He has to be both attractive and successful. And attraction is more narrowly defined. Under 5'10\"? Move along, shorty. Chubby? Please. If you don't have chiseled abs and broad shoulders, you need not apply. Male pattern baldness? HAHAHAHA\nAnd I don't want no scrub.\n\n\"I was not overlooked by teachers who assumed that I did not understand a tough math or science concept was, after all, because of my gender\"\n\nIt's obvious from this statement that he's white knighting for attention, not speaking from experience. Because women make up 70% of teachers, and girls actually get better grades for the exact [same work as boys](http://www.returnofkings.com/75159/study-shows-girls-get-better-grades-for-the-same-work-as-boys). There is inherent gender bias in schools, but it's not against girls. \n\n\"Jared is autistic and he suffers from Lupus and avascular necrosis in both his hips.\" He wrote this editorial because he's a social outcast, and this is likely the only attention from women he's ever gotten. I know that's harsh. But he's whiteknighting for attention, looking for a pat on the cheek because he can't get a kiss, and his perpetuation of false bias against girls in education is harmful.\n\n[Common core for girls](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/reports/2014/10/28/99435/for-women-and-girls-the-common-core-is-a-step-toward-greater-equity/)\n\nThe feminist agenda is based on lies and misrepresentation, with the the core ideology that women are perpetual victims. This is why women who truly believe in equality and the capability of women reject it. Frankly, it's insulting. It's an ideology that, at it's core, removes the agency of women, by both making them into permanent victims and diminishing the value of their choices. \n\nLet's look at that article. \n\n\"In particular, girls of color and girls from low-income backgrounds underperform academically compared with their white, higher-income peers.\"\n\nFirst, it perverts a race and socio-economic issue into a gender-based one. It co-opts the struggles of minorities and poor people into a gender-based narrative, and by doing so, removes the focus from those disenfranchised groups. Instead of focusing on black and poor people in education, we focus on women. And so instead of developing a plan around providing those subgroups with equal opportunities to quality education, we developed common core. \n\nMisleading society to believe that women are suffering from \"the patriarchy\" by changing the narrative is not only morally reprehensible, it has a real negative effect on those groups who are truly suffering. By framing the education gap in racial and economic backgrounds as a gender issue, feminism has prevented those groups from receiving the redress they need and deserve. \n\nBy it's own damn source, linked as a PDF in the article, you can see that white girls (39% SCI/44% MAT) perform better than both all boys (35% / 36%) and girls (28% / 35%), in both science and math (using the National 8th Grade Assessment proficiency levels). Were it not for the extremely low outliers of black (9%) and hispanic (13%) girls, girls as a whole would likely perform just as well as boys in science. And they already perform just as well as boys in math (35% vs. 36%). \n\nAnalyzing the data correctly, the question isn't, \"why are girls performing worse in science and math?\" but \"why is there such a large disparity between minority girls and their boy counterparts, in science proficiency?\"\n\nBut instead of focusing on the real issue, that minority girls aren't connecting with their science education, and that minorities, as a whole, are receiving a poorer education than their white counterparts, this article talks about how girls the nation over \"also often lack access to high-quality, rigorous courses, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM.\" Which is total and utter bullshit. That access is based on socio-economic background, not gender. It should be overtly obvious that there is no barrier to entry girls face in the same school as boys, but feminism wants to paint a picture of female repression. So it goes on to selectively discuss lower rates of AP test takers in specific STEM fields. If girls are taking AP STEM classes at lower rates than boys, it MUST be because they simply don't have access to those classes, there must be something preventing them from enrolling, whether that be patriarchal gender norms, or a systemic failure to prepare them, right?\n\n\"Girls and students of color take the Advanced Placement, or AP, exam for computer science at lower rates and pass less frequently than boys and white students. About 30,000 students took the most recent AP exam for computer science...Less than 25 percent of test-takers were girls...Girls are underrepresented among AP test-takers in nearly all STEM fields. In 2013, for each female student that took the Physics C exam, more than 2.5 male students took the same test. Boys took the the Physics B exam at a rate of nearly 2-to-1 compared to girls and took the Calculus BC exam at a rate of nearly 1.5-to-1 in the same year.\"\n\nBeing an informed individual, I could smell the bullshit on this immediately, so I decided to go straight to the source, and found the [AP program summary report.](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/research/2016/Program-Summary-Report-2016.pdf)\n\nThey use 2013 numbers, but this is a 2016 report, so I expect some variance, but if the problem is systemic gender bias, the patterns should hold. Let's see.\n\nOut of 37 tests, women test takers outnumber men in 25 categories. Of the remaining 12, many were so close as to be negligible (4 categories separated by less than a 1% margin). So of 37 tests, female students were approximately equal to or above the number of male test takers in 29 of 37 tests. \n\nOh, but we're discussing STEM. It's a safe assumption that every test not used as an example in the article was dominated by female students, or at least had equal representation, because their selective citation bullshit is key to painting their narrative of female repression. Again, let's see.\n\nIn biology, female students accounted for over 50% more test takers than males. In calc AB, the variance was in favor of males by less than 2%. In chemistry, less than a single percentage point. In psychology, about a 90% gap above men. In statistics, almost 4% in favor of girls. \n\nSo literally the only variances that favored men were listed in the article. Notice how it tried to present those examples as a representation of the gender gap problem, not as the comprehensive list of every credible disparity in favor of males?\n\nIt's so bias it's almost laughable, except for the fact that people buy into this shit and boys are suffering for it the nation over. So because males represent 75% of computer science students, there's obviously a barrier to entry for women. Clearly girls don't have access to equal STEM education. The fact that girls represent almost 70% of all psychology test takers, or 65% of biology test takers, just means that feminism is working, and girls are taking their rightful place above men, though, right? \n\nThe fact of the matter is, girls don't like computer science. It's really simple. And is that such a big problem? Is it not enough that girls already match or dominate in 78% of AP classes? Are boys not allowed to have ONE educational field that they dominate without reproach, for simply being drawn to it? \n\n\"Girls are underrepresented among AP test-takers in nearly all STEM fields\" I've shown that that was a blatant, boldfaced, flat-out lie. Not only that, they are indeed overrepresented in advanced high school education. Girls were 56% of AP students in 2016.\n\nSo when do we decide we've reached equality? When girls are the majority and outperform boys in every category? Because the current statistics show that girls have every opportunity as boys do, if not more. Of course, the article ends with the all-time favorite feminist myth \"wage gap.\" Which, no matter how many times has been proven to be unequivocally false, a misrepresentation of statistics that doesn't take into account career field, tenure, etc., it still gets repeated ad nauseam. Similarly, we still propagate this \"girls are struggling\" bullshit, and focus our attention and resources on fixing that nonexistent issue.\n\nThe result is a lower quality education for both girls and boys. In grade school, he may not have been told that Legos were not for his gender, but god forbid the author of your editorial wanted to pick up a baby doll. The treatment amongst girls and boys for crossing the gender barrier is exponentially less forgiving to boys than girls. In fact, most little boys will accept the tom-boy girl once she proves herself to them. Boys will at first reject, and protect the group, but once you're in the group, you're in. A girl that proves she can hang with the boys is accepted. On the other hand, little boys who want to play with dolls or dress effeminately will face backlash from all sides of their peers. Adult society has come to accept them, and even welcomes them, as it falls in line with the pervasive feminist agenda. \n\nBut little girls want nothing to do with effeminate little boys, because they're still boys - they can't ever be part of the club. And other little boys will mercilessly torment them for going against the status quo. They will never find popular acceptance, and their isolation and abuse will only grow in time. There's a reason \"that's gay\" became synonymous with \"that's stupid\" in the 90's; without their knowledge, children were perpetuating homophobic attitudes that they absorbed from their parents and society, and it expressed itself through cognitive linguistics. Now, despite widespread support of the LGBT community, my generation struggles to overcome internalized homophobia that it wasn't even aware of, because it's been incorporated into their thought processes since before they even knew that \"gay\" meant anything other than \"stupid.\" \n\nThat doesn't take into account the hostile environment school is for boys, in general, now. It's no wonder boys are dropping out and performing worse at alarmingly high rates when \"no tolerance\" policies are the norm - when typical boy behavior, like roughhousing/mock fighting and fascination with guns and violence is outlawed. When you get detention for playing tag, when you can't wrestle with your friends like you do at home in your backyard, when you get suspended for drawing a picture of a gun, when GI joes are the devil's playthings, why would you like school? They've criminalized all the ways a young boy is naturally inclined to enjoy himself during his free time, and then have literally redesigned the entire education system and process to focus on girls - on the way they think and what they're interested in. Then boys grow up, begin looking at colleges, and are told that they've had all the opportunities and help, that no one wants them because they aren't a \"special group,\" and that they have to be twice as qualified as the next kid to make it anywhere. You're a white boy applying for a scholarship? Can't you just pay in privilege? Please, scholarships are for the disadvantaged women. You know, the one's who outnumbered you in your AP biology and psychology classes. And 20 others. Because they're underrepresented. Can't you just join the military and die for us instead?\n\nBut really, at the university level, there is absolutely no shortage of scholarships available to women to enter STEM fields. In fact, some universities went so far as to demand equal enrollment of women as men, creating an artificial equality that actively denied men the right to an education, all for the appearance of equality. The results were universally disastrous, with many programs being forced to shut down because they couldn't meet minimum enrollment requirements, with women as the limiting factors. There are universities that went a year without a chemistry department because enrollment fell when women decided they truly didn't want to be a part of the STEM program they were pushed into, and transferred to majors that were more suited to their actual desires. The fact is, most women don't see an appeal in classic STEM fields, but we've decided that equality doesn't mean equal opportunity, but equal outcomes. So it isn't enough for women to have more and easier access to STEM programs, they must also choose to enter those programs, even when it makes them unhappy. We're fighting for equality that no one actually wants; we're telling women to choose STEM, even when they don't want to, and in doing so are actually regressing equality by limiting women's choices, in admonishing any decisions they make that don't align with the narrative. We're telling women that their choice to enter social work isn't as valid as entering hard sciences. This is despite the fact that women provably prefer fields of study that involve social interaction and the study of people - fields where their feelings are considered important and pivotal, rather than dismissed in totality, like the hard sciences. This is why when women choose a hard science, they often choose psychology, or else in the medical field, pediatrics or general medicine. But despite the fact that psychology is an overwhelmingly female dominated field of study and profession, there is no call for a 50% outcome. Feminist ideology has conflated the belief that equal access, which is important, should result in equal outcomes, which is not important: outcomes are the result of personal choices, people making decisions that make them happiest. And by demanding equal outcomes, feminists are diminishing those choices of women to pursue the paths they feel a natural inclination for. \n\nEquality is recognizing that men and women both face unique struggles that may limit them from pursuing their hearts' desire, and trying to alleviate those disadvantages; feminism is the belief that there is no core difference between men and women, and therefore any difference in gender representation is a result of patriarchal repression, albeit systematically directly or systemically indirectly (eg. discrimination in admittance/hiring versus constructed gender roles and societal pressure/judgement). The result is that women feel diminished for following their dreams and face undue scrutiny for being gifted opportunities they didn't earn, but didn't ask for. The author addresses this scrutiny in his last paragraph, but fails to question where that scrutiny stems from. Feminism is creating the problems it seeks to address. And men are suffering as well. Besides the arbitrary rejection from the pursuit of their desired education and careers, the barriers to entry and exclusion from the education process has resulted in worse performance by men and boys at literally every level of education, from grade school through college. Not just worse than previously, but worse than women as well. It's not that men have it better but are seeing a decrease in their disparate well-being, but men are already worse off and are seeing steady decline.",

    "text": "Dutch man creates underwear specifically designed for circumcised men. Dutch architectural engineer Rinke Feenstra has founded Ynside Underwear – a new range of underwear that uses organic material and is designed to help soften and restore the skin of the exposed glans of a guy’s circumcised penis.\n\n\nWe caught up with Feenstra to talk circumcision, and how his underwear could be a game-changer for men around the world.\nRinke Feenstra, founder of Ynside Underwear.\n\nAt what age were you circumcised?\nI was three years old. It was done for medical reasons – I was diagnosed with Phimosis, a condition where the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head of the penis.\n\n\nIs it common in the Netherlands for boys to be circumcised?\nI grew up in the rural north of Holland, where circumcision is rare. Around the cities it’s a bit more common because of different cultures.\nI was the only one who was circumcised on my soccer team, which made me aware of the fact that I was a little bit different.\n\n\nWhen did you start to think that your circumcised penis might have a different sensitivity to an uncircumcised penis?\nAs a teenager and as a student, I read things online that made me realise that my sensitivity might have been impacted by my circumcision.\nAt that point I was mad that procedure had been done to me, and I talked about it with my parents.\nThere was a lot of information available online and I realised that I was part of a much larger community of circumcised men.\n\n\nWhat was the process that led you to start thinking about creating underwear specifically for circumcised men?\nI was doing a lot of cycling, and experiencing friction on my penis. I started to focus on my condition as a problem to be fixed, but in doing so I grew more frustrated.\nThe whole experience brought me to a turning point, I decided that it’s better to focus on the positive and make the best of it.\nI was educated as an architectural engineer, developing a critical view of things I see in my surroundings. As a child I also grew up with very health-conscious parents. I think that this combination led me to think about finding a natural, nourishing, and protective solution.\nBack then I didn’t know that I was going to create a brand. That thought grew during the years after because I wanted to give men the opportunity to use my designs and feel the difference.\n\n\nHow long was the design and testing process until you found a product that you were happy with?\nI started making concepts in 2007, and began distributing some test designs in 2014. The first production run took place at the end of 2015.\nMy prices are higher than your average underwear because they’re made from silk. We researched and tested the most skin-friendly fabrics and silk gave us the best results. But it’s not just your regular silk, but an animal friendly, certified organic, and top-quality silk that’s treated carefully throughout the entire process.\nOn average, the genital skin is about 90% more absorbent than other skin areas, leaving it extremely vulnerable to toxins and other irritants. Silk is a protein fibre, and the protection it gives helps to repair and nourish your intimate skin.\nWhen rethinking the design of underwear, we integrated the most important comfort and health aspects, including the extra space pouch, and special protective elements.\nOur products are manufactured in Europe, and our designs have been sold across 12 countries on five continents.\nWhat’s really pleasing is that preliminary scientific tests conducted in the US have proved an increased sensitivity and a better skin structure as a result of wearing our designs, so we’re really motivated to do more research on this next year.\n\n\nWhat’s the response been like, from circumcised men who have tried your underwear?\nGreat, we have a lot of repeat customers.\nIt’s still quite a challenge to get men interested in the products. Circumcision is a taboo, and here in Europe many man don’t see the point of my focus.\nAlso men aren’t used to being open about personal things or feelings. There’s still a lot of ego hidden in a man’s pants.\n\n\nWould this style of underwear potentially also have benefits for men who are not circumcised?\nYes, totally. Silk boosts a man’s comfort and sensitivity naturally. In general, our organic, animal-friendly silk is a nourishing, soft fabric that prevents irritations. For example, if you’re a guy who shaves or trims your pubic hair, then you’ll benefit from the softness of our underwear.\nSilk is also a very good temperature-regulating fibre, combined with the extra space pouch which supports a man’s reproductive health too.\n\nThe underwear is available for pre-order, if someone places a pre-order with you, how long until you expect to be able to deliver the underwear?\nBecause we’re a young company, the crowdfunding campaign we’re running now helps us to pre-finance the next stage. We’re ready to send our improved collection into production.\nDelivery will be made in late February 2018, but we’ve got gift cards available so they’re the perfect Christmas gift.\n\nhttps://www.gaystarnews.com/article/ynside-underwear-circumcision/#gs.LtMe5pY",

    "text": "Some thoughs on prostitution and exploitation, courtesy of the Askreddit thread on secrets So this will be an awkward feature in my post history...\n\nIf you scroll through the [current askreddit thread about deep, dark secrets](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/68l83g/serious_what_secret_could_ruin_your_life), you might be surprised by how many women have occasionally done a little light prostitution. And also by how many other women find the idea intriguing or appealing. Before anyone accuses me of slut shaming or anything: I think there's no shame in sex work and no shame in employing sex workers' services. And neither am I extrapolating the statements from the women in the thread to all women.\n\nThe main thing that struck me about it was the contrast to the narrative in recent years about how prostitution equals human trafficking. I've seen sex-negative feminists in various places on the internet and other media decry prostitution as being all but equivalent to human trafficking. There seems to be a concerted effort to A) shape the narrative of sex work to one of exploited and victimized women, and B) vilify and shame any man who has sought a prostitute, because he's automatically an enabler of a horrendous human rights violation. \n\nHowever, I think reality seems more in line with what's being reported in the Askreddit thread. Unless you're picking up someone who's actually hooking on the street, you're probably getting an independent operator who has made the voluntary choice to earn a little easy cash. The prostitutes themselves don't seem to be experiencing much exploitation, but the peanut gallery is seeing it everywhere. I can anecdotally add that I've personally known and even dated a few women who have sometimes traded sex for money, and there were no pimps or other boogeymen involved there, either.\n\nI guess my point is this: if you've been taken in by the idea that prostitution is necessarily evil because it exploits women and is a human trafficking boogeyman, you might want to give the comments in that thread a look. [edit: I've linked to three of the top level replies in my own comment [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/68pn2o/some_thoughs_on_prostitution_and_exploitation/dh0oyhg/)]\n\nSomeone will invariably wonder what this has to do with men's rights. Since time immemorial, there have been men willing to trade extra resources for sex, and there have been women willing to trade sex for extra resources. So prostitution is a men's rights and a women's rights issue and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Also, sex-negative feminism pretty much always impinges on men's rights (not to mention women's) in some way or anther. And while some people complain that /mensrights focuses too little on rights and too much on anti-feminism, I would argue that this is an example where a large segment of feminists are attempting to engineer social attitudes and curtail the range of acceptable male behavior (both legally and through social sanctions).",

    "text": "Arkansas Dad - Need advice Maybe this isn't the correct place to post.\n\nI live in Arkansas.  I'm 32, and I feel hopeless.\n\nI made the mistake 2 years ago of getting the girlfriend pregnant (we did this intentionally).  At the time she had 4 kids from 2 fathers.  3 from the first batch when she was 18ish, and 1 from her most recent man.  The batch of 3 are all now 18+ and seem well adjusted, but they spent most of their lives without their father.  The youngest was maybe 1, and I was helping raise him.  I was basically there from 3months old on.\n\nWe decided to have another so that the youngest would have a sibling.  I loved him very much, and I wanted my own kid, and it just seemed to make sense at the time.\n\nNow, she has 5 kids from 3 fathers, and basically none of them have been raised by the father in any meaningful way.\n\nWe split up around last August.  She got her own place, but I tried like hell to keep things together until she had me arrested at her house after a fight for Criminal Trespassing.  I was sleeping in her bed (admittedly drunk, so was she) after a fight.  I woke up to the cops telling me to put my clothes on.  I had been living there for more than 30 days even though I still kept my own place incase things went south again. I wasn't on the lease so to jail I went.\n\nRight now I've seen my daughter for about 6 hours in the last 6 months.  I'm missing all the milestones, I just recently missed the first steps and now she's walking like a pro.\n\nI've been paying child support in accordance with the chart the state provides since we split up.  Initially $100/week and then up to $140/week when I got a substantial raise at the beginning of the year.  I made the mistake of paying her in cash until a few months ago, when I setup auto-payment of checks mailed to her.\n\nWe have never been to court.  I'm not on the birth certificate, and there has been no DNA test.\n\nI've talked to a few lawyers and have told me that in Arkansas the best I can hope for is visitation rights and no actual custody.\n\nShe keeps threatening to move to TX where she is from.\n\nHere is the kicker.  I'm all math, no empathy and I get internally distracted for long periods of time.  First child I ever touched was 2 years ago, and they still terrify me.  Simply put, I'm not capable of handling an infant for long periods of time.  I want an agreement that says that I will get visitation a few times a week until she is maybe 4 or 5 at which point I would want 50/50 custody.  The lawyers tell me this looks really bad to the courts and they won't go for it.\n\nI just want to see my daughter and be part of her life as best I am capable.  I'm depressed as shit right now.  Any advice would be helpful.  I live in NWA if that makes any difference.\n\nEdit: it's also probably worth noting that I've got a MSBA and am currently employed as a engineer making 70K/year and she doesn't have a high school diploma and works at a daycare making minimum wage...",

    "text": "Reading this practically broke my brain - not just what was written, but *where* - Rebecca Solnit (author of 'Men Explain Things To Me') - in the London Review of Books No joke - this is the *first* sentence of a 3,500+ word jeremiad ('essay' is clearly not applicable in this case):\n\n> Women told me they had flashbacks to hideous episodes in their past after the second presidential debate on 9 October, or couldn’t sleep, or had nightmares.\n\nLet me be clear - I think Trump is a buffoon. I stated this publicly long, long before his election. Just before his election, after the day of his election, and nothing he has done since has persuaded me from this opinion (it has in fact entrenched it).\n\nBut despite that, the way Solnit chooses to describe him in this essay - even to me, someone who is **not** a fan of Trump - is just beyond fucking absurd:\n\n> Trump roamed, loomed, glowered, snarled and appeared to copulate with his podium, grasping it with both hands and swaying his hips, seeming briefly lost in reverie. The menace was so dramatic, so Hitchcockian, that the Hollywood composer Danny Elfman wrote a soundtrack for a video edit playing up all the most ominous moments. \n\nReally? WTF???\n\nAnd yet still people find it hard to believe Clinton's campaign lost her the **actual** election (let's leave aside the popular vote issue for the moment - and perhaps longer than a moment, but that's a discussion for another day).\n\nMy italics in all quotes that follow:\n\n> ‘Watching Trump lurching behind Hillary during the debate felt a bit like a zombie movie,’ Elfman said. ‘Like at any moment he was going to attack her, rip off her head, and eat her brains.’ *Friends told me they thought he might assault her; I thought it possible myself as I watched him roam and rage.*\n\nIt's often said these days that 'hysteria' is a gendered slur on the grounds that the etymology of the word is, according to the OED,: \"via Latin from Greek *husterikos* ‘of the womb’, from *hustera* ‘womb’ (hysteria being thought to be specific to women and associated with the womb).\"\n\nBut ... almost no one who uses the word actually *knows* that this is its origin and on that basis it is a point of near total irrelevance to raise it at all - for its primary modern meaning (from the same dictionary) is \"a wildly emotional and exaggerated reaction\".\n\nTrying to claim that people *actually* and *genuinely* believed that they thought Trump \"might assault\" Clinton - on live television to tens of millions of Americans and that Solnit \"thought it possible\" herself is - *surely* - the very definition of hysterical, no?\n\nBelieve it or not, Solnit has made these points in just 253 words out of over 3,500! \n\nShe continues:\n\n> Like many men throughout the election, [Trump] appeared to be outraged that she was in it. The election, that is. And her space.\n\nAnd continues:\n\n> Earlier in the campaign he’d urged his supporters to shoot her. \n\nThis is so obviously false that it literally breaks my brain that the editors of the *London Review of Books* (LRB) allowed it to be published. Now don't let's be mistaken - the LRB is a Left, even far Left, organ and unashamedly so - and fair enough, right? Everyone is entitled to his or  her point of view, right? (Excuse the TYT Cenk-like 'right?', 'right'? verbal tic there). \n\nYet the calibre of its usual contributors includes the likes of Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford, [Diarmaid MacCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarmaid_MacCulloch),  Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, [Mary Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Beard_(classicist)), Professor of History at Columbia University, [Adam Tooze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Tooze), and Professor of Early Modern History at Queen Mary University of London. [Miri Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_Rubin).\n\nMy point being that even if you disagree with the beliefs and politics of such people as those I just mentioned, at least you can concede that they are not complete imbeciles that produce utterly baseless trash such as Trump had \"urged his supporters to shoot\" Clinton.\n\nIf that were **actually** the case, then Trump would be incarcerated right now. But not only is he **not** in prison, but he is in fact the President (elect).\n\nBut, perversely, that is yet just more grist to Solnit's mill - on the particular version of Bizarro world that she must surely inhabit, the very fact that Trump has not been incarcerated on the grounds of that frankly ludicrous allegation is - the reader is left to infer - the very proof that the United States is a society that - in the memorable words of of Chloe Angyal - [\"hates women. Just ... hates us.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfKzXa6pjg) (Angyal was, notoriously, saying this to [Sabrina Rubin Erdeley](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/20/rolling-stone-reporter-admits-mistakes-in-jackie-article) following the publication of *that* *Rolling Stone* story ... you know ... the one that was [total and utter bullshit](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rolling-stone-writer-uva-rape-story-nightmare-article-1.2698465)).\n\nSpeaking of which, Solnit is at this point just getting into her stride ...\n\n> Trump is patriarchy ...\n\nShe's dropped the 'P'-bomb already ... still barely past the beginning of this text by the way.\n\n> Trump is patriarchy unbuttoned, paunchy, in a baggy suit, with his hair oozing and his lips flapping and his face squinching into clownish expressions of mockery and rage and self-congratulation. \n\nWell, he is a 70-year-old man after all. \n\nI mean, Heaven fucking Forefend that [media commentators should see any reason whatsoever for shying away from making personal comments on the physical appearance of old people in the public eye ...](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/fashion/mary-beard-against-internet-trolling.html?_r=0)\n\n> He picked as a running mate buttoned-up patriarchy, the lean, crop-haired, perpetually tense Mike Pence, who actually has experience in government, signing eight anti-abortion bills in his four years as governor of Indiana, and going after Planned Parenthood the way Trump went after hapless beauty queens. \n\nIn other words, she suggests that Pence is 'grabbing women by the pussy' in his own way - by taking a stance against abortion. Just for the record, I personally do not oppose abortion - but that's not really the point.\n\nWhat *is* the point is how on Earth is Solnit going to square this narrative with the election results that show that, actually, a surprising number of women voted Trump, not Clinton (why this is just automatically assumed to be 'surprising' is a fascinating question in itself).\n\nAnd it is on this question that Solnit jumps the shark ... or she would jump the shark if that shark was atop the Empire State Building ... smoking a cigar and wearing a monocle ... while playing the base guitar on its fins ... (my italics)\n\n> The Republican platform was, as usual, *keen to gut* reproductive rights and *pretty much any rights that appertained to people who weren’t straight, or male, or white.*\n\nUh-oh, here we go ...\n\n> Misogyny was everywhere. \n\n> Trump’s surrogates and key supporters constituted a sort of misogyny army ... The army included Steve Bannon, who as head of the alt-right site Breitbart News *hired Milo Yiannopoulos and helped merge the misogynistic fury of the men’s-rights movement with white supremacy and anti-Semitism to form a new cabal of far-right fury*.\n\nActually, I agree that Bannon is an asshole, but that hardly justifies the wild and paranoid accusation that \"Milo Yiannopoulos ... helped merge the misogynistic fury of the men’s-rights movement with white supremacy and anti-Semitism to form a new cabal of far-right fury\"\n\n> It seems telling that the rise of the far right and the fall of truthful news were to a meaningful extent engineered by a television network that was also a miserable one-man brothel. *But that old right-wing men are misogynists is about as surprising as that alligators bite.*\n\nWell, that isn't racist or bigoted at all. / s\n\n> ‘No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public,’ Susan B. Anthony said ... \n\nSusan B. Anthony you say? Is that the same Susan B. Anthony who said:\n\n> “You have put the ballot in the hands of your black men, thus making them political superiors of white women. Never before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the political masters of their former mistresses!”\n\nI'm not sure, but [I believe so](http://intersectionalism.tumblr.com/post/130662354761/elizabeth-cady-stanton-1815-1902-social), yes.\n\n> No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public,’ Susan B. Anthony said in 1900. ‘For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonised.’ Or as Mary Beard put it last year, ‘We have never escaped a certain male cultural desire for women’s silence.’\n\nSolnit has yet more:\n\n> One got the impression that any power a woman had was too much, and that a lot of men found women very scary [...] Trump’s slogan ‘make America great again’ seemed to invoke a return to a never-never land of white male supremacy where coal was an awesome fuel, blue-collar manufacturing jobs were what they had been in 1956, women belonged in the home, and the needs of white men were paramount.\n\n> One might argue she lost because of ... years of negative media coverage; or because of foreign intervention designed to sabotage her chances; or because of misogyny. \n\nMedia coverage like the time they showed that when she said she remembered flying into the former Yugoslavia under sniper fire ... she hadn't?\n\n> *I’ve always had the impression –from TV, movies, newspapers, sport, books, my education, my personal life, and my knowledge of who owns most things and holds government office at every level in my country – that white men get a lot of attention already.*\n\nI see.\n\n> To be a feminist you have to believe in your equality and rights, which can make your life unpleasant and dangerous if you live in a marriage, a family, a community, a church, a state that does not agree with you about this. For many women it’s safer not to have those thoughts in this country where a woman is beaten every eleven seconds or so and women’s partners are the leading cause of injury to them. And those thoughts are not so available in a country where feminism is forever being demonised and distorted. \n\nSpeaking of \"demonised and distorted\" I'm having trouble digesting quite what Solnit means by the following point:\n\n> It seems it’s also worse to vote for a racist if you’re a woman, because while white women were excoriated, white men were let off the hook (across every racial category, more men than women voted for Trump; overall 54 per cent of women supported Clinton; 53 per cent of men voted for Trump).\n\nWhat?\n\n> ... one could argue that Trump had said, incessantly, aggressively, I’m a white man, vote for me, and even that Sanders implicitly conveyed that message. \n\nCould one?!?\n\n> Many supporters fell silent or took to supporting [Clinton] in secret ...\n\nEh? What?\n\n> ‘I’ve come to believe,’ Sady Doyle wrote, ‘that, in some ways, saying nice things about Hillary Clinton is a subversive act.’\n\nWhat? Eh?\n\n> Mentioning that [Cinton had] won the popular vote *upset many of the men I am in contact with* ...\n\nNone of the women then?\n\n> ‘With their deep belief in their own special monopoly on objectivity, slightly too many men assure me that there is no misogyny in their subjective assessments or even no subjectivity and no emotion driving them, and there are no grounds for other opinions since theirs is not an opinion.’\n\nSolnit *really* fucking hates white men.\n\n> A lot of people, *particularly white men*, could not bear her, and that is as good a reason as any for Trump’s victory. ... They did not blame themselves or the electorate or the system for failing to stop Trump.\n\n**TL;DR** What's above is actually the TL;DR believe it or not - you can read the thing in its entirety [here](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n02/rebecca-solnit/from-lying-to-leering)",

    "text": "Suspended from school job pending an investigation I work as an IT coordinator at a local secondary school. Have done since aged 16 when I joined initially as an apprentice. My record is impeccable. From the UK.\n\nTuesday we had a new apprentice staff member be suspended for gross misconduct as she had a party which involved several of our students (a big no no). Because of this several rumours have been floating around accusing her of malpractice and safeguarding issues , between students and staff. We were told Wednesday morning about her suspension from the school.\n\nToday the head of the school said he may/may not need to speak to me later on. Turns out he did so he phoned me and I went to his office. Several allegations have been made against me by a staff member who knows the girl and a student at the college at the school, stating I'd been making up inappropriate lies about what went on and why she had been suspended from her job. This got back to the apprentice girls mother who emailed in.\n\nAs I know a boy from the school he approached me with some story, which I told him they were rumours I had heard and just rumours, so he's told some friends (stupid move from me). I did play them down as rumours and nothing more. The student claims I made claims of what went on. When telling his friends this has gotten back to the girls mother who has been suspended. \n\nThey now have been up on a charge of misconduct.\n\nI have stated in a meeting with the head, numerous students have come up to me themselves telling me a rumoured version of events and I have replied with they are rumours and not to be said. These students have heard these rumours from other teachers as I asked where they overheard the story from. Surely these teachers should be disciplined too?\n\nThe girls parents aren't happy we've been told she's been suspended and the head asked how I even knew. I replied that my boss told me so he shook his head.\n\nThe meeting concluded with him stating he hated his position on the matter and he wanted me to take care and he wanted the discussion to be man to man as he likes me but he can't comment further. He did say he'd like to be in my corner but can't as it's an independent investigation. He seemed relieved when he said he has to make a recommendation to the school governors but again that it was ultimately up to them.\n\nI am having an investigatory meeting soon. I have a union representative.\n\n\nI love my job massively and feel depressive and losing it will ruin me. What chance do I currently have?",

I have had my current job for 4 years and now it seems I am going to have to look for a new one due to internal reasons that has nothing whatsoever to do with me or my performance. \n\nI have been an ESL/EFL teacher for 6 years in total and before that, I have worked in and out of many jobs that required manual labor. \n\nI am a native Turk, all my job experiences have been in the country. I have no other qualifications besides my Bachelor's in linguistics, which I haven't practiced or pursued. \n\nI am looking for a steady paying, full-time job since I have a wife and preferably, I would rather work somewhere with a corporate/governmental background. \n\nI am 32 years old, if it helps in anyway. I am open to learning new things but not that open to venturing into a new business with no job security/insurance and jobs that require me putting a large sum of capital into.\n\nThe reason I am writing here is because I've checked google/news sites for jobs abroad and frankly, most of them seem either under/overqualified for a man of my position or too adventurous to begin with.\n\nI am glad for any kind of help or pointing of a finger in the right direction.",

    "text": "I finally called a man out on the bus for touching me So I've always been a somewhat shy girl. I live in a big city where buses can get pretty crowded because of either rush hour or just nearby schools getting let out. Cool. I understand crowded buses; we all gotta get where we're going after all. But what I can't understand is why some men feel the need to take advantage of crowds to feel up other people's bodies.\n\nThe first time I was inappropriately touched was in 8th grade.  \n\nIt was a really crowded bus as the middle school I went to was near other schools that happened to get out at the same time. The bus stopped at one of the main bus station so naturally, many people got off and there was a lot of bustling as half the bus fought their way to the door. I thought nothing of it until I felt someone's fingers roughly shove their way into my crotch from behind. By the time I had turned around, the person was lost in the wave of people getting off. I was literally the shyest I have ever been in my life at that time (was voted the shyest girl in the school that year actually) and so I never said anything to anyone.\n\nThe second time was on yet another crowded bus, a couple years into high school. This old Chinese man was holding onto my upper arm from behind which I was using to hold onto a strap above for balance and I thought it was a little weird but just assumed that he had nothing else to hold onto for balance so I shrugged it off as nothing. At least, until his hand reached down and started grasping at my right boob. Luckily, I was with my best friend this time who had gotten a hold of a seat and squeezed me in with her. The man got off at the next stop. We said nothing except for a few comments of disgust.\n\nThe third time, which happened a year later, didn't really involve me being touched sexually but was more creepy than anything. I was boarding a the bus with the same friend and as I stepped on, I could feel a guy pressed up close behind me. I thought this was very strange as the bus wasn't anywhere near crowded enough to justify that and the man kept this up as we got on until my friend and I were standing holding onto straps for support as we chatted. Now at this point the man had backed off a little, just enough that he was still there but not enough for anyone to go wtf at him. My friend and I were talking quietly about something about which stop to get off at, the man swaying with the bus to casually make contact with my back the whole time. Keep in mind this bus is not crowded by any means; my friend and I had chosen to stand because our stop was nearby. As we got off, the man made a remark, breaking into our conversation about something we were discussing. I later complained about this to another friend and halfway into describing the man, she quickly cut me off and finished the description for me. Apparently the man was hanging out near a mall next to a highschool and had been coming up to highschool girls and trying to give them his number. This was a young blond male in his 20s(?).\n\nA couple hours ago, I was riding the bus home from my old highschool where I was visiting a retiring teacher. It was an extremely crowded bus because the same line ran though at least a couple schools and a few stops away from where I was supposed to get off, I gave up my seat for an elderly man and started standing by the rear exit. Not a minute later, I felt fingers stroking my left butt cheek. I thought it was my imagination at first so I shrugged slightly away only to feel the fingers return. I was 100% sure those weren't some stray bag at that point; those were human fingers stroking from my lower to upper butt. \n\nI was done. I'd gained confidence in highschool thanks to mentioned teacher and I was sick and tired of being touched. I've gotten nothing but trouble from guys in college who just can't take a damn hint. I was called a bitch for not giving them a chance (I have a boyfriend) so I did what I felt was right. I called him out on it.\n\nI turned to him, looked the middle age blond man straight in those sky blue eyes of his and said in the loudest voice I could manage, \"Touch my butt one more time and I will report you.\" I knew I had the right man. He met my gaze unblinkingly and slowly nodded. No one seemed to have paid attention or cared. But at that moment, I was relieved.\n\nWhen I got off, I found out that my sister was on the same bus and had squeezed onto the front of the bus. If she had gotten on the back door, my little sister could have been in my position instead. She could have been the one touched instead of me. And I know she wouldn't have said a thing.\n\nI know this isn't a big deal to many people but I had to get it out somewhere. Thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR Guy kept stroking my butt, I called him out on it, and my little sister could have been his victim instead of me if she had gotten on the back door instead of front.\n\nEdit: Ahh thank you! I honestly only expected a few upvotes and a comment or two perhaps so I was honestly surprised when I came back... And only one nasty PM to boot! Thank you so much! \n\nEdit 2: Holy...thank you for the gold! I had to refresh twice because I couldn't believe my eyes... Thank you!\n\nEdit 3: To those wondering, seeing something like this happen and speaking up to either the culprit or just getting attention to that happening would be amazing. Silence is not golden in this case.",

    "text": "To the milk crate stranger at 7-11: Thank you I'm not sure if this is the right place to put this but I just really need to get this out there.\n\nI've been working my current job as a housekeeper at a private nursing facility for about a year and a half now. And I know this may seem weird but I love my job. My bosses couldn't be nicer. My coworkers are so loving and funny and supportive. And the job itself is really not that bad. I'm learning a lot and feeling like I'm actually making a difference.\n\nIn the time that I've been working there, I've never once had to call out sick. Sure there's been a few times where I've felt like calling out because of a bad headache or 'that time of the month' cramps. But I always had this sort of guilt, like, I finally have this job that I love and treats me right. To call out, I felt, that they would be disappointed in me. Also, as this not-yet-30 female who's only 4'8\", most of the time I feel like I constantly need to do more and prove myself. That I'm not just so kid who is constantly getting asked how old she 'really' is.\n\nAnyway, so yesterday morning, I woke up and found myself feeling not so well. I was feverish, lightheaded, and had zero appetite. But still, that little voice in my head said 'Don't let your bosses down. They've done so much for you.' So I pushed onward, driving into work and also stopping at the local 7-11, thinking that I might find something there that might appeal to my appetite.\n\nHowever, as soon as I got back to the refrigerated wall near the back of the store, I started feeling so much worse. I had one of the refrigerated doors open, thinking the cold air would help. It only emphasized my current state. And that just made me so upset and frustrated, wondering why I couldn't just push through this for 8 hours. Why couldn't I be stronger? I started crying, which only fueled my frustration and shame more. Here's this not-yet-30 'adult' crying in public, what a disappointment.\n\nSuddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and a voice beside me saying, \"It's okay, you can sit down.\" My current state overrode whatever confusion I had right then and I allowed myself to be sat down on what I later found out was one of those plastic packing crates for milk and such.\n\nThe owner of the voice was a man, probably in his late 40's, wearing a blue button down shirt and khaki pants. He crouched down beside me, hand never leaving my shoulder. That and his unwavering smile, and all that built up emotion just finally broke. \n\nI cried hard. Not that dainty Arwen-pretty crying but full out Robert-Downey-Jr-in-Tropic-Thunder crying, snot and all. And I was like that for a good 10 minutes, unable to talk or anything. And the whole time, he just crouched there, rubbing my shoulder, not saying a thing.\n\nFinally, the wave of emotions ebbed and I was able to calm down. \"So I'm not going to ask if you're okay, because clearly you're not,\" he said. \"And I'm pretty sure you probably don't feel like talking, much less to a complete stranger. But if you need someone to just shut up and listen to you, I could do that. My wife says I'm a great listener.\"\n\nAnd I don't know what it was because I'm usually such an introvert and have such a difficult time talking to other people. But the fact that this random guy was sitting there on the floor of a 7-11 at 5:30 in the morning, taking the time out of his probably busy schedule to help someone he didn't know. It just made me feel so cared for and that I could open up to him.\n\nSo I told him my story in a nutshell, having to stop a few times to collect myself. And he was right, he was a good listener. Never interrupted me once. And when I was done, he just sort of sat there quietly for a minute or two before saying anything. (And I'm going to try and recall everything he said but I might not get it word for word):\n\n\"Well, it seems like you really hit the jackpot. You have a job you love and bosses that treat you fairly and respectfully. And you have coworkers who you wouldn't mind seeing outside of work. That's quite an accomplishment right there.\" He pauses there. \n\"I have a daughter who's just about to finish up her freshman year of high school this May. And she just started her first job about a week ago at this clothing store at the mall. And she tells me she couldn't be happier. She gets to work with a lot of her friends from school, has a nice boss, and the work is not so hard where it starts to interfere with her studying. And I was actually at the mall just yesterday, so I stopped in to see how she was doing. Of course, I didn't let her see me as I didn't want to be one of those dads who embarrasses their daughters in front of their friends. And for the brief few minutes that I saw her, as she organized this table of shirts and laughed with one of her coworkers, I knew that she was really happy. And I know that her boss really appreciates the work that she's doing there, as I'm sure yours does. And I'm sure that, if your bosses really love and appreciate and respect you, that they wouldn't want you pushing yourself so hard that you make yourself sick. They would want you to take care of yourself. Because with all the care and dedication you put into your job, sometimes you need to put a little bit care back into yourself.\"\n\nHis words really hit home right then. So much so that I started tearing up again (happy tears this time). He then helped me to stand up and we made our way to the checkout line where he proceeded to talk about his current job (as a middle school science teacher) and how he had had a slew of other past jobs which he had never truly felt happy or appreciated in. And he told me that even though there are the not-so-great days at his work, he still feels like he's making a difference. \n\nOutside of the 7-11, he stops me before I go to my car. \"Now I'm going to need you to promise me that you're going to go straight home, curl up with as many blankets as you can find, and get a good sleep. You need to take care of you right now and that's all that matters.\"\n\nI made the promise and thanked him again and again. Then we parted ways.\n\nAnd even though I never got his name, I feel like I will never forget him. His quiet understanding or his kind encouragement. To know that there are still people out there, with the world in its current state, who are just so selfless and caring. It just makes me think there is hope after all. \n\nEdit: HOLY COW! I am just now getting home and finding this absolute plethora of messages, comments, and even a Gold (thank you most kindly Reedit_girl!)\n\nThank you all for your loving messages and support! \n\nAnd yes, I am feeling so SO much better now and was able to go back to work today.",

    "text": "Thank you for raising beautiful daughters - Father's perspective. I want to thank the amazing woman who raised two beautiful daughters.  \n\nThis happened yesterday while my wife, my 2 year old daughter and I were at LegoLand Discovery just north of Toronto.  The mall was packed as it was Family Day so all the families were there shopping just as we were.  My toddler is tall for her age so she was allowed entry to play in the indoor jungle gym.  She was having an amazing time and my wife and I were so happy for her as we try to let her experiment and try new things, until she reached a point where she was stuck. She was stuck on a platform that she couldn't get down from as her feet didn't quite touch the ground and she was scared of falling - understandably so nor could she go back up because it was too high.  The nice attendant asked if we wanted to go get her because she was doing that cry that isn't really a cry but more of a cry for help and my wife and I decided to say \"no.\" We wanted to encourage her to make the \"leap\" (maybe 6 inches) onto the platform.  This is where your daughters came in.  They were about 5-6 years old and started to cheer on my daughter. When other children were just going around my daughter they were saying \"you can do it, look at mommy and daddy. They think you can do it\" and with a little bit of help, she was able to put her feet on the platform.  We were both so happy for my daughter, as was she.  Your daughters didn't stop there.  They held her hand through other parts of the gym that my daughter couldn't get to on her own. My daughter followed your kids through tubes, rope ladders and slides which she never would have done on her own.  The expression on her face makes me smile just typing it.  When it was time to leave, my daughter looked up to your 2 girls with a smile bright enough to light up a room and said \"tank you\" and our hearts just melt.  We wanted to thank you ourselves but when I did, it was kind of awkward and creepy. Like here is this grown man thanking me for my daughters helping his daughter, kind of thing.  I wish there was a way to express my gratitude to you now so here's my best attempt:\n\nThank you for giving my wife and I hope that there are children who were raised to help others and do the right thing.  That your daughters will be there to comfort and console the girl being bullied in high school.  That you instilled a sense of \"treat others the way you want to be treated\" in them. That they saw my little girl and felt that being her friend was better than her being alone. I sincerely hope your daughters grow up to do amazing things because this world needs people like them to lead us places that we are too scared to go on our own; to go down the scary \"tube\" or climb the tall \"rope ladder\"; to lend a hand and a voice of encouragement when someone's afraid of falling; to make someone smile instead of crying because they said \"you can do it\" instead of \"do it on your own.\"\n\nI like think my wife and I are good parents, but I will strive to be the kind of parent you are.  You are a great parent and teacher to your daughters.  From our melted hearts to you...Thank You.",

    "text": "Jostens Yearbooks scammed Our High School for Years.. Edit #2: This blew up, so I wanted to put at the top if they ever see this: THANK YOU YEARBOOK CREW! Deadline is tomorrow and they are still working as we speak (12:00 AM EST). Your hard work is why it's worth it!\n\nI wrote this as a comment in a post today but I feel like it needs to stand on it's own as well. To start: I don't work for Treering, but this all came out of a post about potentially switching to Treering for yearbooks. I think it's really important to understand how Jostens did the smoke and mirrors routine for years until they finally got caught. Here it goes:\n\nAs technology teacher, I took over yearbook advising last year to raise funds for our tech department. Immediately upon taking over I was sent invoices from Jostens in the amount of ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. What? How do we OWE for a yearbook that costs $78 (price goes from $55 to $78 by the end)? Where is the money going? That question led me down the biggest and shadiest rabbit hole I have ever seen. \n\nFirst, when asked to send an itemized invoice, Jostens was hesitant. Finally, after persistence, I got it, and low and behold the numbers just didn't add up.\n\nWhy? Well first off I had nothing to go off of because they had not sent a contract IN THREE YEARS, so I could not even refute pieces of any agreement. Secondly, a line item showed up in the top right in small print on our invoice saying \"production fee\". What was this? After pressing again, Jostens was making us pay $100 FOR THE FIRST 50 BOOKS, AND WE WERE SELLING THEM FOR $55 a piece! That's right; our kids were buying books for negative fundraiser profit. No mention of this in any contract. No mention of this even on the line items in the itemized invoice. Nothing.\n\nSo I go down the lines and - oh hey! - we are getting charged ~~$1500~~ $860 for \"advertising materials\", . Sweet. I never asked for this, you just sent a box of posters. If we made them ourselves it would have cost us maybe $50. But tack on another ~~$1500~~$860, awesome.\n\nSo I'm already at our wits end by the time the books arrive, and things get even better. I count the books and while we ordered 320, we received ~~375~~365. Why do we have so many extras? JOSTENS SENT US THEM WITHOUT OUR PERMISSION, AND CHARGED US! They claimed it was for kids who forgot to order them so we could sell them, but if you look at the numbers of books it conveniently brought the small amount of profit we made to zero. They then want you to return the books by a certain date (usually in the summer) for a credit refund. JOSTENS ZEROS YOU OUT WITH EXTRA BOOKS AND HOPES YOU DON'T SEND THEM BACK.\n\nYou think that's the end? Oh boy, not even close.\n\nSo after months of being pushed around, I made it one of my absolute priorities to get these kids the most money I could back. I nit-picked every little detail, knowing full well that Jostens had no legal ground on things because no contract was signed and our students had paid a lot of money to this shady company. I argued about advertising, I contested them about the extra books, everything. In all, Jostens waived around $5000 in money owed. Think about that for a second. Jostened erased ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34. at the wave of a wand. If you can magically erase ~~$5,000~~ $4,748.34 out of nowhere, what does that mean for the charge to begin with?\n\nSo finally satisfied that I could be rid of the plague that is Jostens for ~~$1,400~~ $1,475.82, we sent paperwork to our downtown financials to pay our balance and move one. That should be the end of the story right?\n\nWrong. Downtown gets back to us and notices that JOSTENS IS CHARGING US TAX ON OUR YEARBOOKS. They collected taxes that never existed, to the tune of ~~$1600~~ $1,614.79. So, livid, I send an email to JOSTENS demanding our payment record for the entirety of our relationship with them and find THEY DID THIS FOR FOUR YEARS. They claimed that they needed a new tax exempt sheet from us but we never sent it in. They had the old one, which is THE SAME NUMBER as a new one, but that's what the problem was. They are supposed to be cutting a check to us now for around $6000 (5/11 update: they cut one for $2,737, trying to figure out that now). Now think about how many schools use Jostens and how many schools they potentially did that to. That's a class action lawsuit in the millions of dollars right there.\n\nMy blood pressure is up just writing this. They have basically robbed our students for years, and it happens all the time because advisors come and go and rarely have time like I did to catch them and call them on their crap.\n\nSo we went with Treering this year. First off, I came in with fangs and demands from the get go because I was so pissed off and jaded from Jostens. I started mentioning everything to the guy and listed all my needs in what I wanted contract wise and he was like \"yeah our contract is one page long.\" It's literally one page long (front and back). The next thing I asked was the base price, which came out to $35.62 (140 pages, estimated 300 books sold). JOSTENS BASE PRICE WITH ALL THE HIDDEN FEES WAS $58. They were going to bump it down to $40 (so generous!) when I told them we were firing them.\n\nSo our Jostens ones sold for $78, and now we sell them at $60. So that's $18 LESS per book and $25 MORE in fundraising money. We went from owing Jostens $3k last year to [raising over $7000 this year](http://imgur.com/a/WYUgM). I have learned that we can do discounts for students with free and reduced lunch, so our goal is to make the books equitable for all students. I think you can do this with Jostens as well, but I didn't have the time during my battle to find out.\n\nI love my students and defend them rabidly, and seeing how Jostens treated our school makes me sick. Go do the math on how much Jostens (or ANY yearbook company for that matter) is making on your school and you will be too. I would be upset about any swindling, but public school kids? Our free and reduced kids could never afford even discounted books because prices got out of hand, and all because of shifty tactics and corporate greed.\n\nSo on the technical side, Treering is not a big improvement from Jostens software, but I do like the linking with social media and especially Flickr. We post all of our pictures to Flickr for the kids to view, print and share during the year for free, then we can automatically grab from albums and place. The themes are good, a lot to choose from too.\n\nI could go on, and if you want to talk more please PM me, I try to tell anyone that will listen this story because it really is an injustice. \n\n*********\nEdit: Admins banned post for \"self promotion\", so link removed. \n*********\n\nOh man that felt therapeutic getting out!\n\nEdit #1: thank you to u/behemothpanzer for submitting to r/bestof , I have put so many hours into fighting this small battle that no one knew about or cared about and it really means a lot to me to see such support. I also wanted to add that I don't just have problems with Jostens, other yearbook companies have done shady things too and I don't even know them. This was from a post at the bottom of the comments about a yearbook company essentially trying to bribe me:\n\nAnother thing I didn't point out is that other companies try to lure you in with free gifts. A company told me they would [give me a free $50 gift card just for meeting with them.](http://imgur.com/dAwATtz) Like ME a gift card. I'm pretty sure that's illegal, and if not that's immoral as all hell! Greasing teachers with gift cards... unbelievable.\n\nEdit #3: Thank you everyone for reaching out, it means a lot to me. I tried to respond to everyone, and if I missed you I'm sorry I will try tomorrow. It's late hear but I was too pumped about your support! Goodnight and thank you!\n\nEdit #4: In a poetic moment, I went to my school mailbox this morning [and found this!](http://imgur.com/rrlRRL9) Haha\n\nEdit #5: I fixed up some language here and went back to get some exact numbers from invoices.",

    "text": "Which career path should I choose for 2017? **Preface:**\nI am currently 30 years old and 13k in credit card debt. After I ended an unhealthy relationship with my ex-girl friend towards the end of 2015, I moved into a small studio apartment by myself and spent 90% of 2016 working 7 days a week (one full-time office job during the week and a part-time job doing food deliveries on the weekends.) I didn’t really go out much, barely focused on dating, and pretty much kept myself in isolation. \n\nI have been living in Florida for over 10 years now, but I don’t feel as accomplished I think I should be at my age. I have an entrepreneurial spirit and my dream is to become a digital nomad traveling the world while working remotely as a freelancer, business owner, or even working for a company that permits location independence. \n\nI have been teaching myself front-end development, but I barely have the energy or the time to learn effectively due to the limited hours in my day along with the mental exhaustion and laziness from working 2 jobs. I have told myself that I do not want 2017 to be a replica of the past year where I’m just working dead-end jobs, overexerting myself, and not truly focusing on my passion. Below are the following paths and opportunities I have currently.\n\n**1.) Remain in Florida:**\nI literally just paid off my car this month. That’s $278 extra I will have available. I could continue working both my full-time and part-time jobs and apply that surplus of income towards my credit card payment. Subsequently, if I choose this route I will remain “comfortable” in the sense that I enjoy living and being in Florida, but I will still feel as if I haven’t progressed much and will continue learning code at a slower pace. \n\n**2.) Teach in Vietnam:**\nThis option has been extremely heavy on my mind and I have been doing the most research on this path. I have watched many vlogs, joined FB groups, and read Reddit posts pertaining to teaching in Vietnam. My overall plan was to get TEFL certificate by flying over to VN and doing an in-class TEFL course while there, where you get experience working directly with the students. After you receive your certification the school guarantees you a job. \n\nThis option seems very appealing to me for multiple reasons: I have always wanted to travel to Asia, I enjoy working with kids, I’d work part-time hours (15-25 per week), and I can supposedly can make anywhere from $1,500-$2,000 per month. I would use the additional hours off (that I’d normally spend working at my full-time job) to immerse myself in studying code. I would also be to focus on productive activities as a whole to help clear my mind and help refine my skill set so that I will be able to be employable to work for a web development company or freelance on my own. \n\nAs much as I want to take this option I have been weighing the pros and cons. First, I do not have a bachelor's degree (or any college degree for that matter.) In order to get work visa in Vietnam, this is a requirement. I have read about and “interviewed” a few people who claim there are people without degrees who are still able to teach English in Vietnam, but they have to do “visa runs” and exit the country and come back every 3 months.\n\nThe program I’m trying to go through (which guarantees me a job at the end of the course), claims they shouldn’t have a problem finding me a job, but they cannot confirm exactly how much money I will be making and stated I most likely will be working in the rural parts of VN and not in the city such as Ho Chi Minh or Hanoi which I’d much prefer.\n\nThis presents a problem to me in a financial sense. If I were to quit my job, break my lease, sell my furniture, and go to Vietnam, I would still have a $300mo credit card payment, my $111mo cellphone bill, and pay a monthly storage fee of over $100 to keep my car in Florida (I do want to keep my vehicle--just in case.) Without a concrete idea of how much I’ll be making as a TEFL certified, college degree-less teacher on a tourist visa, I’m understandably apprehensive as I might be going from a bad situation to worse if I cannot sustain myself in Vietnam while paying any bills back home in the states.\n\n**3.) Move to Texas:**\n\nThe “safest” and most logical option would be to move to Texas. I have a cousin who is very intelligent and connected with the right people who has the ability to get me a scholarship for free at any college in TX (and possibly here in Florida). She emphasizes the importance of a college degree and understands the rut that I am in. Her offer is for me to move to Dallas Fort Worth, live with her in her house with her husband rent-free, work for her business part-time for 15-20 per week, and the rest of the time go to college to get my bachelor degree in any major I want.\n\nI know the majority will say this is the obvious way to go, but as a 30 year old man who values his independence and prefers to teach himself code (I have seen many instances where people have landed web development jobs by learning on their own or attending short-term bootcamps and without a CS degree--although the CS degrees helps a lot!) I prefer not to invest the next 4-5 years studying in college not doing what I’m passionate about. This opportunity will allow me to save money and help me get out of debt, but I have this overwhelming sense of unfulfillment by living under someone else’s roof in Texas (where I’m not quite sure I would even enjoy living).\n\nMy heart is set on Vietnam the most because I am still young, no kids, no girlfriend, and have no attachments other than my “debt.”  I feel as if I don’t travel now, I won’t do it as I get older. I would like to see the world and wouldn’t mind isolating myself away from the distractions and hustle and bustle of Western life to focus on myself and gain mental clarity.",

    "text": "I am a high school teacher who no longer wants to teach high school. What masters degree complements my skill set? The question: I have skills in education, history, and technology. What would be a marketable masters degree that would complement my skills?\n\n\n\n\n\nHello all, I am 25, I have a bachelor’s degree in history education, and I have hit that stage of \"What the hell do I do with my life.\" \n\nMy goal is probably naïve but bear with me. I want to make a 90k-130k a year, I want the opportunity to travel, and when I end up with gray hair I want to be a professor of history. \n\nMy family privileges include having a good financial background (my late grandfather owned a company and my father refuses to spend any of the money so he lives like a mountain man) and we own some large tracts of land in places that are being slowly developed. \n\nI long term substitute taught for a little while and I liked it, but I don’t know if I could deal with the students and my want of making the perfect lesson plan (I was working until 6-7pm on the average night.) I got constant reviews (staff and students) in student teaching and in my stay as a sub that I am a great teacher; I was even applauded by the students at one point during a public presentation.\n\nI am currently teaching \"EPIC\" (an electronic medical records system) to health care professionals. I am good at it, I am a nerd so I understand the computer system and I have my teaching background so I can translate it into terms basic-level users can understand. I make alright money ($21/hr) and there is room for advancement. But I do not see myself working there as a career. \n\nI know I should start getting to work on my masters, but I am at a road block deciding a major that is marketable and involves my skills. I also am part of the belief that I should not pay for my graduate schooling, so I am on the lookout for assistantships. \n\ntl;dr: I have skills in education and technology, trying to find a master’s program that is decent. \n\n\n[Here is a previous and naive post I made in /r/DreamCareerHelp](https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamCareerHelp/comments/42j0lb/my_dream_job_is_a_history_professor_who_travels/)",

    "text": "What to do with my Career considering Dyscalculia, Job Options and College? OK, this will be a little long so bare with me.\n\nI feel like I've hit a roadblock in life and don't know how to get over it. First off Let me explain, I have Dyscalculia and I just recently found out about it. For those of you not familiar with this disorder, it depends on the person, it varies, but generally, you cant do math properly, no fault of the teacher or tutor, its essentially your brain just can't get certain aspects of it down, ranging from the very basics, to time to advanced math etc. I was always a B and A student with occasional C's thrown in the mix. But I was always horrible at math. I sometimes lose place counting in my head and even have to use my fingers at times and I give pause even to addinging and subtracting, but i can do it, it just takes me a few extra seconds to process it at first. I start to struggle a bit with Decimals and Fractions unless I have a calculator to help. And Algebra or Geometry? Might as well tell me to try my chances at highway robbery, I'd have more of a shot at succeeding in that. I cannot get it. I can't absorb the formulas or understand how to solve the equations to save my life, if i do, its only for a brief moment then they leave my head. I only ever passed High School math (for my school it was basic algebra and geometry that were required) due to massive amounts of Homework in extra credit sections and tutoring, of which I failed the extra credit homework as well, but the teacher felt bad for me, so he passed me.\n\nI graduated from HS years ago in 08 (27 now) and decided \"Hmmm, sure, Ill give college a try!\" I went part time for the next 4 years while working to pay for it at first then my parents chipped in latter on. I've done a number of odd jobs during that time, everything from Fast Food, to Waitressing, Retail for a number of years, and warehouse work. Went for a few years to Community, got great grades in everything except, you guessed it, math! Same Situation, had an understanding teacher \"Don't worry no one fails my class!\". He literally let me go and ask him almost every question on the tests and I did.\n\nI had thought to go into teaching but I have bad anxiety speaking when its a room bigger than about a dozen, I almost fainted in college speech class when I got up in front of a room of about 30-something students. I thought briefly of pursuing Social Work but not long after that, my mom had a stroke, then cancer, shes still alive and made a phenomenal recovery tho on both accounts. I stopped going to college around that time and got fired from the warehouse job (only job I ever was fired from in case that's relevant).\n\nSo this is where the roadblock comes in. I had to move back home after my roommate and her boyfriend got a condo (a little after I was fired). I found a job, that was my first priority. Its working leather, its a nice environment, small business that's less than 15 people, great product and employees, nothing stressful most days either....but it pays crap (only 10$ an hour) and the boss is a man child. I've been there for almost 3 years in a few months and NEVER have gotten a raise, and some of the employees who were there longer, they stopped getting raises as well. Everytime we ask him it was \"oh well I can't because taxes are coming up\" *Comes in with a new boat, \"Oh I cant because we just got new equipment you guys needed to make the product quicker\" *Comes in with not 1 but 2 motorcycles....yeah you guys get this picture. Now hes going thru a divorce, went back to being an alcoholic and is neglecting getting us supplies at times, and his wife owns half the company...we all decided we might as well not even ask for a raise this year lol. to top it off we have been slow for 3,4 months now, its like Im essentially making minimum wage with paychecks.\n\nIdk what to do, at all. I've been applying everywhere, for something on this level or better, I cant afford less than 10$ an hour its impossible to survive on that, I'm struggling like mad now with my current pay cuts, like if my car broke down, sure i have great credit but I don't think I could afford another, Id be screwed. I have applied at better quality retail like Aldi's and Costco due to having 3 years of experience and considered for Front End Supervisor at Sam's Club in the past, I would have to work my way back up but that's fine with me, but no one has gotten back to me. I applied at Walgreens as an assistant manager trainee, Really sold myself well in a video interview....no follow up. I looked into trades like Plumbing and Carpentry and...hey what do ya know? My old enemy, advanced math and formula's strikes back. I failed the 2 entry tests to get in. I tried getting a waitressing job again, no call backs from my local Olive Garden (I hated waitressing, so kind of a relief), I even applied to be a service tech to Spectrum and....yes, even a person who removes \"remnants\" at Crime Scenes since it doesnt require a degree (just finished that one today). At this point I'm starting to feel desperate and trapped, Unless the bosses wife gets the company, which who knows if she even is interested in it, then I'm screwed working here and I'm not going to sit on my bubbly butt to find out what happens with that! I'm now thinking of doing what my dad does and go for the post office, or even as a custodian as they make decent pay after a time if they are union. Garbage person too has crossed my mind... but beyond that, with no degree, my options seem to be narrowing down. Especially since Jobs don't seem to train but want someone with full experience.\n\nNow, since my credits are still good, I was thinking of going back to college. I even took a few classes on and off the last few years to finish up my science aspects for my Associates. But idk what to do. I like helping people so I was thinking of getting a social working degree or looking into something with Technology that does not require in depth, advanced, calculations-does anything like that exist in the tech area? But Idk what to do about the Math, that seems to be my main obstacle in, well, getting out of being poor lol :( and I have a stupid disability in it along with ADHD, go figure. No matter how hard I try, i cant pass Algebra or Geometry on my own or with help. Idk if Colleges can wave math if they see Im going to follow a career that has no use for it, because I feel, unless I can substitute classes, thats my only option. Even then, there is another problem-my parents cant afford to send me to a 4 year college, my sister is in her program for physical therapy and that's A LOT of money for my parents, especially since my mom cant work long hours anymore. Taking out loans seems scary too, I already cant afford dirt, barely enough for my car payments and cell phone with anything left over and I've read the countless horror stories online of people with tens of thousands of dollars worth of debt and no one hiring you out of college, sometimes up to multiple years if you have no experience in the field. I can probly pay to finish community College at least but I need a better job...but I cant get a better job without math or someone calling back.\n\nI feel like such a loser, having to move back in my mid-late 20's, no decent paying job, not having a totally clear idea of what to do, cant save up and cant afford much. Im just so beaten down and overwhelmed, I sometimes cry to myself, punch a wall, and even feel like just jumping off the bridge. Like, I hate this, it feels like its soooo difficult nowadays just to get by, or Im I just so broken down its just me and a few others at this point?\nWhat would you guys suggest? College again? try for an outside job with little math skills and keep searching in that arena, highway robbery lol?\n\nEdit: Paragraph breaks",

Perform comedy, start my YouTube channel, and go hardcore learning about business and marketing through online resources so I can apply it to my business. Monetize my videos and sell merchandise.

    "text": "Should I Become a Programmer or an Electrician? I'm in a dark spot at the moment to get my life together, but since I'm only 20 (turning 21 in a couple months), I'm in a good place to have said crisis. Here are my two options:\n\n1: Software Engineer\n\nThis is the job I want. I'm an indoors person. I don't mind sitting in one place using all my brainpower to solve problems as long as there's aircon and free shitty coffee. I like solving problems. I genuinely enjoy tackling complex problems and rearranging them into simple solutions. I've only just started taking up programming in python (at 20, I know. Bit of a late age) since yesterday and I'm surprised at how much I've gotten the hang of it. I'm also a fast typer, and I pride myself on my spelling and grammar skills. If I could be a programmer in a big city with a good source of income, I'd be happy. So happy, I tell ya. If I were somehow offered an $80k programming job, I'd weep like the day I was born.\n\nProblem is... I didn't do too well at math in school. I had the misfortune of going to one of those nowhere schools with depressed teachers that only showed up for a paycheck. I coasted through the math courses by pattern recognition alone. I didn't learn the intricacies of math and learn from previous formulas to create my own. Now that I'm 20, I'm willing to re-learn math from scratch and have an open mind about mathematics and make it a passion of mine. And to get my best foot in the door and not be automatically turned away by any of the more snobbish businesses (and hopefully not to be stuck at dead-end jobs), I'd have to undertake a computer science degree. I know. I know what you're thinking. I know I shouldn't do it if I suck at math, but I'm willing to unlearn and relearn, man. With enough discipline and devotion to study... can I do it? I don't know. At least not now. Before I forget to mention, I've actually got two computer science graduates in my family. One of them graduated with first-class honours and is currently undertaking a PhD. They'd be more than willing to help me. Well, at least the one without the PhD would at the moment. I know that slogging through a degree just to get a job isn't an amazing idea, but... whatever. I guess I'd better learn to love to study.\n\n2: Electrician\n\nThis is my safe route. As long as they know how to do the work, show up on time and slog through the hours, electricians get paid well. In fact, most skilled labourer types of jobs will. They're also pretty easy to learn all the insides and outs. Thing is, though, I have zero interest in manual labour. Not really a fan of it. If I start an apprenticeship, my heart won't be into it. I'd grow weary of the work fast. But it's a stable job that pays well. Long hours, but good pay. One thing that rubs me the wrong way with blue-collar work is the culture, especially here in Australia. I know that everybody's different, but the vast majority of labourers I'll run into are the bloke-ish fellas, whom I don't mesh well with.\n\nI'm in a battle between following my passion and hoping the money will come or following the money and tolerating what I'll put most of my living hours into. In short, I just want a job that challenges me, makes me excited (or at least tolerant) to challenges, jobs where I use my brain instead of my hands and feet, a job where I solve problems, a good salary, good work/life balance and a job where I'm surrounded by smart people dedicated to their work and enjoy what they do.\n\nThanks for reading. You can go get a drink of water now.",

    "text": "Semi-complicated question about getting into a CS career without a typical HS diploma This question is going to have to involve a lot of background, so prepare for quite a bit of text.\n\n**TL;DR: Life keeps throwing me curveballs, and despite stellar grades I'm two years behind for graduation. Is it possible/feasible to get a career in software development without a formal high school diploma? If so, how would I go about pursuing that?**\n\nI'm 18 years old, and I want to go into a tech job. While I'm not entirely picky on what specifically I go into, I know I am both good at and genuinely enjoy programming- my stepdad raised me, and seeing as he's a software developer I grew up with exposure to it, at age 10 or so I was already studying Python to learn some basic logic.\n\nUnfortunately, around age 12 my parents separated, and since then my life has seemed determined to screw itself up as much as universally possible. I'm now considering dropping out- not to give up and work a minimum wage job, but as a genuine option.\n\nBasically, I have had issues with public schools and the general American education system since 1st grade. I have ASD (autism spectrum disorder), and while I am plenty intelligent and capable, my brain doesn't do well with environments that most kids would've flourished in, and until I learned how to successfully imitate normal socialization, the other kids thought I was a bit odd. I switched schools at the end of 2nd grade. Then again at the end of 3rd. Then again, at the end of 4th, and 5th, and 7th, and 8th. Keep in mind, my issues have never been grades. I'm a straight-A, honor roll student. The issue for me was bullying and the general school environment- in 5th grade, I threatened suicide if my parents made me go back, and to this day I have nightmares about the bullying I went through and the way the administration handled it. (I didn't go back, incidentally- I finished 5th grade through independent study, and then 6th and 7th were completed through online homeschooling.)\n\nIn high school, I was doing okay for a record amount of time- 9th grade went amazingly, and about half of 10th did as well. Then, of course, because I was doing so well emotionally, my physical health had to fail. I spent the remainder of 10th grade in and out of the hospital, and was held back. It took about 2-3 years to figure out what was wrong with me and fix it- the anti-depressants I was on were making my body sick from serotonin overdose, and of course coming off of them gave me suicidal depression due to some major chemical issues in my brain.\n\nDuring that time, the school administration sucked. They tried suing me for truancy- yes, I was definitely skipping school so I could go hang in the hospital with IV lines. Super fun time, 2 kool 4 skool man!! Eventually, when we got a legal letter from the doctor saying I was NOT skipping school (Apparently, the dozens of doctor's notes were not good enough), they funneled me into the Florida Virtual School program. Uh, yeah, even kids who aren't chronically ill can't pass that program- the curriculum is notoriously horrible. I was in all AP classes prior to getting sick, and even I could not handle that workload. So, I got held back. I was now 1 year behind.\n\nNext year. We finally pulled enough teeth from the school board to get me into the Hospital Homebound program. This is supposed to be an independent study program like the one I did in 5th grade- but oh, no. This was just virtual school again, but with a tutor sent once a week to assist me. I worked like crazy, and managed to pass the year after working through weekends, breaks, holidays, and the summer. I didn't even finish all the material- the school board just gave me credits after the tutor attested to exactly how hard I was working.\n\nThe school board continued to give me issues repeatedly, the meanwhile I was working on how to combat my depression without Zoloft- to date, I've been on at least 5 different medications, have been hospitalized so many times that people raise their eyebrows at me when I can't remember the exact number, and have been seeing a therapist for a VERY long time. I'm considered a 10th grader by the school system, however I am in 11th grade classes, and am set to graduate in 2019... my original graduation date should've already happened, in this past May. All my friends from freshman year are now in college.\n\nI have tried every single option the district has offered. Partial schedule, where I go in for a few classes a day. Virtual school. They won't provide Hospital Homebound to me since I'm not considered incapacitated enough for it anymore, even if I wanted to go through that again.\n\nCurrently I'm about halfway through the equivalent of my junior year, and it's miserable. I sit through 5 classes a day, and every single one of them feels useless. I'm in honors, but I still finish about 30-40 minutes before everyone else does, leaving me to sit there and stew in my thoughts, not being allowed out of class to do anything more productive. Due to diagnosed PTSD from all the crap I went through with school as a kid and my autism-related anxiety when I don't have anything to do, over half of every day I'm in school ends in a meltdown. You know that meme, autistic screeching? Well, I don't scream, but I end up leaving class and sit in a guidance office for about half of every day crying and unable to physically get myself to speak more than a couple sentences out loud.\n\nTeachers refuse to read my 504, guidance refuses to listen when I say no, I can't go to class right now unless you do want me literally screaming under a desk. I was sent to a mental hospital during one of these incidents- they literally dropped me in with a bunch of suicidal kids, and I was there for 24 hours in living hell (Florida youth mental healthcare is NOT beneficial- it's more like a prison) before a psychiatrist finally realized I didn't need to be there.\n\nI do not think I'll be able to continue like this for another year and a half. I'm not learning anything, I'm sitting there listening to a teacher lecture me on things for an hour that'd take me 15 minutes to learn on my own on places like khanacademy. If I dropped out today, I am completely confident I would be able to study for and pass a GED test by the end of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\nI've done lots of research, but unfortunately most of what I find focuses more on a lack of a college degree than a high school diploma- from what I have gathered, it is entirely feasible to get hired without a degree if you build a portfolio, which is what I am currently working on. But next to nothing has any real information on dropping out of high school.\n\nI want to do something with my life, and that's not happening right now. I'm taking mindless tests and writing mindless essays that don't feel like they're benefiting me aside from getting me baby-steps closer to a piece of paper. I want a job, I want to get to doing what I have a passion for. The only reason I'm still in school is for that piece of paper, but if I don't truly, absolutely need it, then I am wasting my time and going through hell for nothing.\n\nSo- is dropping out a real option for me? Does anyone have any recommendations on how to move forward and get a career, if so?",

I get a lot of questions about the program, and how it works so let's chat.\n\n**What is the Flexible Talent Network (FTN)?**\n\nIt's their way of bringing on supplemental staff for busy season. Most of you are familiar with seasonal staff from firms like Siegfried Group. This is similar, but PwC cuts out the middle man and employs you directly.\n\n**Is it for Audit or Tax?**\n\nI only have experience with Audit, but it looks like they have the program to Tax folks, too.\n\n**Who is it a good fit for?**\n\nI've met a really diverse group of people in the program over the years. Personally, I first joined because I wanted to spend half the year traveling. Now I spend my off months working on *The Abacus Show*, and building a business. I've met parents who want to keep their skills sharp, but still want to spend summer with the kids. Stay at home parents who spent the last 15 years raising the kids and want to get back in the workforce. One year there was even a 65-70 year old accounting professor who said he wanted to get some real-world audit experience to be a better teacher.\n\n**How is it different from working at the Big 4 through a third party temp agency?**\n\nBesides who signs your paychecks, I have no clue since I've never worked at one of the other firms. Maybe someone with more experience can chime in?\n\n*Obligatory disclosure - I've been doing this program for a few years, but I'm not currently employed by PwC, or speaking for the firm.

We were to pick an inquiry (a topic of interest), and write a proposal to our teacher, who happens to be a white male. Of course we both wanted to pick poc related topics. I picked homophobia in the black community, and she picked colorism in the black community. We both received feedback the next week. Mine was positive, but hers was not.

    "text": "My teacher said men can't be raped... I'm going to be very vague and not give many details because I don't want my identity to be figured out. My female teacher, teaches a core 10th grade subject, recently went on a rant for about two whole periods about how men cannot be raped. Her initial argument was that if a man is raped by another man, it's considered sodomy. She said a man cannot be raped by a woman because its biologically impossible. She said if a women grabs a mans genitals with out consent, it's sexual assault. When I confronted her about this, she got very defensive, I pointed out the blatant sexism that her definition of rape has. She argued that it's not sexist because women have more \"fragile\" organs that can be damaged during rape. When I said that the mental damage is the same with women and men if not even worse with the people like her that put rape victims down, she said that the definition of rape she used is the current definition of rape used by the FBI. She stumped me because I did not know if it was true or not and I couldn't fact check it at the time. Later, I did some digging and found that the FBI did at one point use that definition of rape, but later changed it so that all sodomy can be classified as rape or something along those lines. I'm just at awe at the amount of kids that don't really know what being skeptical is and just retain all the information that a teacher gives them with out questioning it. I'm positive that there are now ATLEAST 30+ kids who now have the mindset that male rape isn't possible. More than half of them are male themselves.",

    "text": "I couldn't say no. A feminist piece. When I was five I started Kindergarten in Philadelphia. I was one of only a handful of girls in the class. At recess the boys would trip me and push me and call me names. I was small and not a fighter but to keep myself safe I would bite them. Everyday my parents would come pick me up and find me in the time out chair. The teacher would approach me and say, “Harley, aren't you sorry for what you did?” \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nWhen I was in fifth grade I was the only girl to join mathletes. I competed and won. I was the best person on the team. My teammates would tell me that if I were captain boys would feel intimidated by my success. They assured me that they would still let me have a voice but asked if I would be willing to not join the executive board and instead let four male peers run the team. \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn middle school I wanted to join the golf team. There wasn’t a girls team and a girl had never competed with boys before. They told me I had to drive a ball 100 meters which I could successfully do. They told me that as a girl, I could only join practice but not actually compete. They said I should be thankful they were even letting me do that. \n\nI said thank you and nodded my head because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn high school I started dating a boy. He was popular and well known in a city I was new to. He was funny and charming and smart. A few months into our relationship he confessed to a locker room of boys that we had had sex despite it not being true. It was important to him that people thought we had and my persistent protest didn't matter. He reminded me how much he cared about me and that I could depend on him for support at my new school. His friends would excitedly ask me if it had happened. I swallowed my pride and the truth. \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nMy first year of college I met a boy that lived close to my dorm. We hung out many nights and became close friends. He was interesting and made me happy but never seemed too interested in me. My roommates assured me that if I gave up my modest fashion sense I could attract him. They dressed me in a skin tight red dress. They smeared dark makeup on my eyelids. They pulled and straightened my hair and put me in heels I could hardly walk in. When they were done they took me to a mirror and proudly said, “You look beautiful. He's going to love it. Don't you?” \n\nThrough tears and disbelief in how different I looked I said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn my second year of college I was out late studying. I didn't want to walk home in the dark so I called a taxi. I made clear to the driver that I had a credit card and no cash. He said that was fine and started the meter. 4 dollars later I tried to hand him my card. He complained that the card company would take a percentage and that this was too low a fee. I again explained that I had no cash. He locked the doors and became aggressive and angry. I paid him fifteen dollars. An eleven dollar tip to make sure I could get out of the car unharmed. As I left he said, “See that was easy wasn't it?”\n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn my third year of college I was walking down a back road in broad daylight. There were other students on the street and I felt very safe. I was wearing a summer dress and flats. An intoxicated homeless man grabbed me in places I did not consent to. I ran, crying, home and contacted the police. After several months of meeting with detectives and correctly identifying my assailant he spent one night in jail. My case worker called and proudly told me, “I told you, that if you are honest and diligent, the justice system does not fail. Aren't you proud of what we've done?”\n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nNow it is my last year of college. I have become loud and to many people annoying. I call out the blatant sexism most of our society is willing to ignore. I worked hard to put a competent woman in the white house and had to watch her say yes too many times. I marched with thousands of women to protest an encourager of rape culture from sitting in the oval office. \n\nFor 22 years of my life I have been conditioned to say yes. Today I start to say no.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

    "text": "the effectiveness of the female perspective in podcasting I am a comedian, and I host a podcast with my girlfriend about the complexities of dating, and understanding the opposite sex. I want to tell a quick story about how I changed perspectives on the issues that women face on the day to day grind.\n\n'The Sex Actually Podcast ' is equal parts stories of sexual experiences, both successes and failures, and also cautionary tales of where past relationships have gone wrong. We talk about what drives us, improving communication in our dating lives, and how our family upbringing molded us into who we are today. One thing I've learned spending countless hours chatting with Tasha, my live-in partner and cohost, is that women don't always have the luxury of sharing stories of the freedom of a drunken night gallivanting around town. Too often the story ends with a man fucking up a woman's trust and freedom to be present.\n\nI guess this post is a 'feminist teacher appreciation post', which I look forward to doing more often. Instead of shaming me for not walking a mile in her shoes, or shunning me for not being able to relate, Tasha takes the time to explain to me her day to day experiences. I've learned to listen. Just last week, an innocent trip to the grocery store ended with her being followed around several aisles because a man decided it was the appropriate market to be hitting on women. He didn't accept her social cues and commented on her boobs by telling her 'looks like your girls are out to play'. Ya dude, Frozen Food aisle is the new tinder. And the thing about men is, he would have never made her feel uncomfortable if I was shopping with her. We respect women in the presence of other men, but then when alone, cowards like frozen food guy emerge with their witty pickup lines.\n\nTasha will never know the freedom that I have to get drunk with friends, stumble home on the subway, interview for a job solely based on merit, and so many other countless basic rights. I am a comedian, it is a privilege to speak my opinions. Tasha works as a model. She's a brilliant thinker, very well read and a major advocate for the feminist movement. Yet, she is encouraged to not show emotions, never mind take a stance on social issues. Some men want to look at models, not hear them think. It makes the models human, and that ruins their experience. Can't keep that boner hard if these models keep yapping about ways to improve humanity. Yuck.\n\nThis past election season Tasha posted an instagram pic in support of Bernie Sanders. She was nervous to share her opinion, as most of her photos are lifestyle images, showing off a carefree and opinion less side of her. Most of Tasha's following was supportive, but it only takes one asshole to highlight the issues women face. “You're not pretty enough to offer thoughts on politics. UNFOLLOW”. Quick research showed us that this comment was written by a dude who is a college football coach and father to a teenage girl. THIS opened my eyes to the shame and control of thoughts that men put on women. Now clearly this man has issues, but he said what a lot of men think. 'Not now honey, the men are talking...'. A quick attempt at doing something meaningful that doesn't exactly fit into the confines of her job description was swatted down effortlessly by a stranger online. I was there to comfort her, but the helpless feeling of not being able to confront this dude face to face helped me realize that women feel that feeling everyday. Not being able to fight a fare fight. Unfortunately it took the ignorance of another man to show me which side I want to be on. Tasha and I bonded that day.\n\nWhat I love about our show and our relationship in general, is that we challenge each other's point of view. We are fortunate enough to be having a dialogue together that I've never had with women before. We don't always agree on every issue, but I hope other couples are having similar discussions. Understanding each other will help us resolve the issues that come from a lack of empathy. Respect isn't something owned only to our mothers, sisters and wives, but also to the stranger at the grocery store, or woman walking alone on the street. Men, we aren't losing our seat at the table, we're just finally letting women enjoy the meal with us. Lets listen.\n\nThanks for reading my 'appreciation post'.

    "text": "Cover letter advice on a pretty unique situation Hi I would appreciate any advice on this issue as I'm not experienced enough in the job market  and this is a pretty unique situation I got into\nVery long post, long but true story\n\nI completed my PhD and some months after applied for a great job in another European country (I'm from a southern European country) and was offered the job to start 2.5 months after (which is standard at that company)\n\nA few months before that interview I started dating a girl and things evolved quickly and we fell in love, which during the months between the interview and the date I had to go grew even more and we knew we want to be together. But there was a big issue, she was an ilegal immigrant in my country (she came with her father and overstayed). This means that she was unable to go with me. She could go back to her country and come meet me after 3 months (which would make her legal in her return) but she would be unable to work during the entire period I would be working there which could be many years.\n\nThe second option, which was what we took, involved trying to make her legal in my country by entering in a stable union (like a marriage) which would allow her to then be legal and work when we went together. The manager (would be boss) was very generous and allowed me to delay the start of the job for 4 months later to attempt to solve the situation this way. We tried to do it and were unable to make it work due to the stable union not being recognized due to her being ilegal (even though our lawyers said it should be), and the same when we tried to marry. So she went back to her country and came back a bit over 3 months after. \n\nThe day of my departure came and I had everything ready to go. On the morning of the flight my documents were stolen so I was unable to travel and since it was during the vacations period the bureaucratic procedures in my country work very slowly so my entry was delayed, first for 2 weeks and then the human resources told me it was for a month for their own internal procedures. \n\nBack to the girlfriend situation. She had gone to her country and after a few weeks we found out she was pregnant. We decided to keep the pregnancy as she would have a lot of difficulty having a kid later on as she has PCOS. She came back to my country 2 days before my departure date and, it could be from the stress of changing countries, she had a miscarriage. It affected her brutally due to the high probability of not being able to have kids later on, she went out of her mind and made up her mind that she would be unable to feel ok if we went due to what happened as she would be deeply depressed and be very isolated due to my job involving many hours out of home. \n\nGoing alone would mean she could not stay in my country either and wait until she felt better, as she came with a visa to marry and the marriage process would take long. If I went she would have to go with me against her will or go back to her country. At the time the situation was such that I had to decide between breaking the relationship, or staying.\n\nWith all the drama and my family pressure (they never wanted me to go) I panicked and sent an email explaining briefly the situation saying I couldnt go at the time and couldnt ask for another delay as it was a third one and it didnt feel right to ask for that reason (huge mistake, should have asked of course but was not thinking clearly). A few days later I sent an email asking for a delay of 2 months to try to solve the situation. I received a reply a week after saying the job was cancelled. After around a week I sent an email to the manager apologising again and explaining the situation with a bit more detail because I felt it was the least I could do.\n\nNow after around 3 months they opened a job slot that is very similar to what I had applied. I want it, a lot, and I'm a good fit for it. What I fear is that (understandably) they view me as unprofessional, that Im not trustworthy and that they doubt my commitment. I understand that, as the whole story is very complicated and the fact is that I gave my word that I would go (despite no contract being signed), and 3 times on the date that I was supposed to go I had to ask for a delay. I feel ashamed of that and I have always been a man of word, but the situation involving my family affected me too much emotionally that I didnt think clearly. I have learned my lesson now, at great cost due to the opportunities missed.\n\nWhat could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited?\n\nAt the time of the interview I was asked about my commitment and I gave my word that if they offered me the job I would go. I kept my word up to the point of the family issues. Between the time of the interview and the first starting date I was called for interviews for two jobs at a great international organization that offered even better pay and was at a better location, and for another job in switzerland that offered even better pay. I refused on the spot to keep my word. After a few months I was offered a teaching job in my city and refused for the same reason. Now I'm unemployed and with a high probability of remaining so as the job market for phds is seasonal, most job are to start in September next year.\n\nI will apply for the position, but I'm not sure on the following:\nShould I mention any of this even briefly in the cover letter?\nShould I try to show them I keep my word and this was an exception because it impacted my personal life tremendously? Should I contact the manager (would be boss) directly and mention any of this? For example by mentioning I refused the other job interviews\n\nTL DR: got a great job offer a year ago, for 3 times had to ask for delay (months) in the starting work date for family reasons (and one time for documents stolen) and the job was cancelled. Now a similar job opened and I want to apply. What could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited? In terms of the cover letter and potentially contacting the manager (would be boss) directly",

    "text": "My new manager made me get on my knees.. Sexist treatment and advice needed. ***Edit: UPDATE!!!!! I emailed a very detailed email to HR last night. I had my previous manager proof read it first to make sure it was very professional and informative. We settled on a final copy and I sent it in. The only reply I've received so far today was along the lines of \"We got the email. We are going to discuss it. You'll hear from us soon.\" So HOPEFULLY they take me seriously and fix the issue. If anything negative occurs, I will be contacting a lawyer. Thank you for all the kind words of encouragement!***\n\n\n\nHello! First I want to apologize for any formatting issues, I am on mobile. \n\nI finally got a job in December 2016 after nine months of unemployment due to a car accident. I thought I had struck gold with this job. I had a fantastic (female) manager and a friendly coworker (male). I'm going to call the coworker Jimmy. \n\nI work for a very high quality shoe store. At the end of December, my amazing manager told me she was quitting for a better job opportunity. I was happy for her, and excited to have another manager that was rumored to be a great guy. \n\nWhen the day came for the new manager to come (Let's call him Greg), I was welcoming and friendly to him. He seemed nice, but things have quickly gone down hill. \n\nAfter a week here he changed the schedule (we usually do it monthly) so that I almost always work with him. I am well trained and used to working on my own, but suddenly I'm stuck with him daily. He started calling me to his desk for me to lick his envelopes for him. Jimmy would be sitting right there, but he would make me come over and do it. It made me very uncomfortable. \n\nThen one night, he and I are alone at the store. With it being a high end store, it isn't very busy usually. He tells me I need to practice because I'm not doing very good at my job. I was very confused because my customer reviews are fantastic and my sales are good. He made me go out onto the sales floor, get on my knees and take off his shoes. He then made me measure his feet. Measuring feet is not a complicated thing! He throws in a few pointers and I politely thank him for the advice and explain I've already been trained on measuring. He ignores me and makes me go get shoes for him. I try to hand him the shoes, but once again, he makes me get on my knees and put them on him. He went on to grab my pants later in the evening and pull up my pant leg to show all the way up my calf to \"look at the way I tie my shoes\". \n\nI felt like he was trying to prove his dominance or something. I felt uncomfortable and creeped out. I asked Jimmy the next day if Greg had made him do the same thing, but Jimmy hadn't had to do it. It's been weeks and he still hasn't had to do it. \n\nGreg has gone on to make it my job to do all the store cleaning. Him and Jimmy do the \"manly\" things like shoe repairs and fixing things. I feel incredibly discriminated due to my gender and sexually harassed. \n\nAny advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated. Once again, I apologize for any grammar or editing mistakes. Have a wonderful day!",

    "text": "It could have been me. When I was 12 my mother remarried. He was a very large man who had the ability to spin shit into gold. Some might say sociopath, others would say charismatic. I will tell you what many other girls will tell you. He was a predator.\n\n\nWhen I knew him he cheated on my mother and was violent with me. I didn't know at the time but he was sexually abusing girls my age. It has come to light that he has a laundry list of victims. His most recent was his last. He was caught, indicted, and looking at a minimum of 25 years without parole.\n\nAfter my mother divorced him, he remarried and had children. He told my mom that he would rather be miserable than divorced. His first wife left him, his second wife drove into a tree. He preyed on 14 year old girls. Girls so small and young, they didn't have many options for self defense.\n\n\nHe was always a coward. In highschool he would throw up before a football game because he was afraid of getting injured. Instead of accepting his fate in prison (he was a former prison guard and lawyer so he wasn't going to have many friends), he decided to eat a gun.\n\n\nWhen I heard the news that he was no longer in possession of his skull, I laughed. I told him he would eventually kill himself, just a matter of time. It was quite possibly the happiest day of my life.\n\n\nBut now it's all starting to sink in. He became violent with me because I wouldn't play his games. He wasn't going to be able to do anything sexually with me because I always met him with hostility. My instincts knew what he was, I just wasn't aware of how bad it could have been if I didn't fight.\n\n\nI was abused by my own father, I was sexually assaulted by someone I once called a friend, and I was raped later in life. The only reason I didn't become one of my stepfather's victims is because I fought back.\n\n\nThis is my message to everyone. Fight. It doesn't matter the outcome. But you fight with every ounce of strength you have. You fight for your life. If someone is determined to hurt you, then you make them earn it. Don't ever stop fighting, until one of you can't get back up.\n\n\nBecause I chose to fight him, I was injured multiple times. His favorite thing to do was to slam my head into the granite foyer or brick kitchen floor. He ended up giving me three concussions. But he was never able to get my clothes off. In turn, would stand over him with a baseball bat while he slept. When he would wake up I would tell him to go back to sleep or I would crush his skull. He always chose to go back to sleep.\n\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a situation where someone is trying to hurt you, fight back. Yes, you will likely be hurt in the process, but don't give them an easy win. That sack of shit was 6'3 and 325 pounds. I was 5'2 and only 130 pounds. But I was able to fight back enough from being abused in far worse ways.\n\n\nAs for the coward, he's no longer able to spin his shit into gold. And neither god nor satan can save his sorry ass. The truth is now known. He can't hurt anyone else again. And the only ones left to defend him are his mother and sister.\n\n\nFor all of the young girls he abused after he left my life, I am truly sorry I didn't crush his skull with that bat.",

    "text": "[Support] I need this off my chest TW: Child Abuse and Molestation\n\nThere's so much on my mind, this is going to be very scattered. There's a lot more to all of this too, but I need something off my chest. \n\n4 Years ago on mothers day, at age 14, my maternal great uncle molested me. A man I had never felt comfortable around, a man my family always pushed me to hug when I saw him and get close to because we 'were just so similar!' A man who tried to buy my silence after it all but 'forgot his wallet.' The next day at school I immideatly went to my principal, I confessed it all to her, talked to the counsellor, found myself at the local advocacy centre within hours. I made my case, he was arrested, I continued the process. He luckily pleaded guilty, but got not jail time (because you know what they do to child molestors in jail... and he was too old to handle it). I had a restraining order, thearpy, but only half a supportive family.\n\nMy unlces assured me that my great aunt would be divorcing him, and my aunts offered all their support. But my mom simply couldn't believe it. Turns out, my great aunt did not want to divorce him, may even believe I made it all up (I simply don't understand, her husband pleaded guilty). My grandmother was torn between her sister and her granddaughter. But my older family had silently decided that things like this should stay within the family, in fact never even brought up. And that my speaking out had runied the family name and their reputation (He had been a lawyer, happily retired and big in the community). I feared that my great aunt staying with him meant that not all parts of my case would be respected; I had mentioned in this case that I feared for his grandaughter, a girl who was about 4 at the time (the age I remember starting to get weird vibes from him). The judges order was that he could not drink (He had been drinking at the time of the abuse), he couldn't see me, but he also could not see his grandaughter more than once a week and definiltey not without another adult present. But who was going to enforce that when his whole family was against me? And I was powerless to do anything.\n\nIt took my mom a couple years to come to terms with the situation, realise that I was the one who was wronged and how to respect me now. It put a strain on our relationship but it's nice to have my mom back. My paternal grandmother couldn't respect my privacy following it all, and I still can't talk to her. \n\nA few months after it all when I went to confess to my friends about the situation, my best friend got mad. Said I should have told them sooner, that they would have done something, they were so angry. I bawled, I had no intention of hurting anyone and had done nothing wrong. \n\nThe other day my mother and I saw my great aunt at the grocery store and she stopped in her tracks and had the most sour look on her face before turning away. I coudln't believe it and it sat so unwell with me for the rest of the week. \n\nMy point is that the only person allowed to be mad in this situation is me. I'm the one that got abused. I'm the one who has to live with this now. I can't celebrate mothers day anymore. Oh I ruined your husbands reputation? I don't care, you have no right. I didn't want to talk to you about the most awful moment of my life right after it happened? You wern't the victim, I was, you don't get to be upset. It's been almost 5 years and I am sick of always being apologetic over this. I never got to be angry. I want to get angry, I want to yell. I'm tired of everyone else getting angry at me because of how much this has messed up stuff for them when it should be me that is mad with him.\n\nThanks for listening. I just am getting so tired of all this and I needed to get it out. I'm hoping this helps.",

    "text": "My (19F) experience with my abusive father, and new information that has come to my attention that I don't know what to do about. **TW: ABUSE** sorry I know this is going to be a very long post but if you bear through the whole thing, I commend your efforts. haha!\n\n Ive been hiding this new information for almost a year and I dont know what to do. I've seen this thread help many people just get things off their chest so I thought i'd give it a try. 4 years ago I discovered my father was sexually abusing me without my knowledge. not physically, but by placing hidden cameras in my room and shower and recording me having sex, changing, showering, and sleeping. He saved the videos and photos with very pornographic titles. I was 15. I took him to jail and he stayed there for a year and a half. and that's on top of a bunch of company theft charges (over 50k worth of theft from his company where he was a theft prevention investigator for a shipping conpany.) They came across tje theft in the police raid of my house. He had a good lawyer. surprisingly enough, this is not the secret. this is just background info. \n\nBasically last year, my cousin who I consider my brother who is about 10 years older than me and lived in my house when I was 3-6 came to me with his own history with my father. he flew out from across the country to visit his own parents and to talk to me in person. turns out when he was living at my house, amd even before then, my dad was very sexually forward with my cousin. never PYSICALLY did anything,  but my cousin would walk in on him while my dad was supposed to be working in the back office of my grandmother's family buisness where he would find my dad sitting there, masturbating to porn amd he would grab a stool and tell my cousin to sit down. he would then talk to him about what he was doing and what he was watching, and he would keep going while talking to him. this happened on a few occasions when my cousin was only 10, he never told anyone. \n\nlater when he was forced to move in with us, my dad would consider him like a \"guy friend\" now that he was a young teenager.  he would take him on long car rides and brag about his sexual endeavors before my mother, AND about sexual endeavors WITH my mother. Bragged about how she was a \"little christian virgin\" when he met her but he was persuasive. My dad also set up a camera system so he could send live feed video of what was happening in my parents room (him having sex with my mother) to downstairs in my cousins room right to my cousins tv with some wiring.  my cousin OBVIOUSLY never used it and tried to pretend it wasnt there. When my cousin was still young he moved out of our house the moment he could and moved across the country and started working. I remember being oblivious and sad about it that I was losing my brother so abruptly but now I'm just so terrorized by the fact that he lived through all that against his will for so long. \n\nI'd like to add that my mother was never aware of the videos being taken, as my cousin recounted in some of the videos my dad forced him to watch, my mother said something like \"is that camera thing on?\" concerned, to which my dad replied \"no, the red light means it's off\". I believe she had nothing to do with any of this as she is a sweet woman who had to deal with this man's terrorizing emotional and sexual abuse her whole life.\n\n She is also aware of the fact that she might suffer from a learning disability as she never did well in school outside of music class despite her many efforts, and she had to repeat many early grades. I believe this because of her maneurisms now, her language barriers and overall difficulty understanding concepts. I love her to death, I just know she does struggle with these things. My dad knew this too and constantly took advantage of her and controlled her.\n\nMy cousin has given me full rights to tell anyone I wish about what happened to him, primarily my older sister who is heavily still connected to my father and backs him a lot. My dad is a VERY controlling man and my sister has always been extremely close to him. he never abused her. He treated her better than he treated anyone. spoiled her, let her do anything she wanted, which was sports, which made him love her even more. He did not love me. I for some reason was a resilient and smart child and I didn't conform, which made him abuse me mentally as a child even more, amd spank me profusely. I grew up to be a bit more of a sexual person than my sister, which made him want to control me even more. My sister was luckily asexual and my dad loved that about her. \n\nI want my sister to see more evidence to what a truly terrible man he is. I also want my mother to know because it is her right to know she was abused more than she knows, but I don't want to upset her if she doesn't need to know. I also feel like this isn't my information to share even though I have permission. I'd rather it come from my brother, but perhaps him talking about it is harder than he made it seem when he opened up to me about it.\n\nMy cousin does not wish to press charges because it is so far in the past, and he feels guilty for not saying anything because he could have potentially prevented what happened to me. Also the only evidence he has at this point is his word. I don't know what to do or who to tell or if I should tell anyone, and to be honest just getting this off my chest is more helpful than I thought it'd be.\n\nI don't really know what I'm asking for here. maybe some guidance. maybe just some moral support. Ive never seen psychological help outside of my school social worker who was admittedly extremely helpful but that was only for about 6 months after the initial incident. Maybe that's something I should seek. \n\nI don't know. has anyone been through anything similar? I think I just need someone to open up to about this, so thank you for being that someone.",

She is coming up on retirement in the next few years and is at the end of her rope.\n\nShe called me in tears today asking what she should do about the doctors that she works with. Apparently in the OR they constantly make sexual remarks, recite vulgar rap lyrics, make sexual gestures (IE humping the table), etc.\n\nShe's not a prude by any means but she feels very disgusted by their antics. I was surprised when she told me these guys are in their late 40's to early 50's!

When enough becomes enough, and I am sure it will, they can go to hospital admin with what they have documented. \n\nIf that falls short then a lawyer or even going to the news is an option....I think. I told her that she is probably in the best position to challenge them since she is close to retirement.

    "text": "What do I do with my life? I feel like I'm enduring a crisis right now because I'm an 18 year-old Canadian male, graduating next year, and I have no clue what I want in life in terms of a career. Throughout my time in high school, I've always worked hard for good grades and took higher level courses to keep my options open. However, it never occurred to me that I don't even know what I want to do; not even the slightest idea. I've always been into music, and I've become an experienced musician over the years. I'm very interested in music production, and I've been making beats for some time. You'd think I'd just do something with music, but based on conducted research, I've come to the conclusion that most jobs related to this kind of hobby make fuck nothing. \n\nMy uncle is one of the most prestigious lawyers in the GTA, and owns a firm. He's assured me that I have a spot at his firm if I decide to study law. He makes close to $600,000/year. I've always been dedicated to my studies, and no different in the workplace. Despite this, I do not believe money is entirely happiness. I believe it plays a critical part, but I believe that loving your job is as equally important to the salary. Unfortunately, my uncle and I both become very stressed when working at the firm.\n\nI'm not sure if I should man up, suck it up, and study law or to pursue something I actually want to do. I'm not very interested in anything other than music, and do not stand a chance in the competition for my other interest (medicine). I've concluded that if I do not figure my shit out sooner or later, I'm going to apply to the Canadian Forces as an infantry unit. I'd rather fight to protect others than be a loser.\n\nI'm asking for your input because honestly, I've got no idea myself and my career counsellors are pretty rubbish. I'm also very open to any criticism so if you've got shit to say, I'd like to hear it. Thanks in advance guys.",

    "text": "What could I do to try to restore my credibility and make the company believe I'm commited? Hi I would appreciate any advice on this issue as I'm not experienced enough in the job market  and this is a pretty unique situation I got into\nVery long post, long but true story\n\nI completed my PhD and some months after applied for a great job in another European country (I'm from a southern European country) and was offered the job to start 2.5 months after (which is standard at that company)\n\nA few months before that interview I started dating a girl and things evolved quickly and we fell in love, which during the months between the interview and the date I had to go grew even more and we knew we want to be together. But there was a big issue, she was an ilegal immigrant in my country (she came with her father and overstayed). This means that she was unable to go with me. She could go back to her country and come meet me after 3 months (which would make her legal in her return) but she would be unable to work during the entire period I would be working there which could be many years.\n\nThe second option, which was what we took, involved trying to make her legal in my country by entering in a stable union (like a marriage) which would allow her to then be legal and work when we went together. The manager (would be boss) was very generous and allowed me to delay the start of the job for 4 months later to attempt to solve the situation this way. We tried to do it and were unable to make it work due to the stable union not being recognized due to her being ilegal (even though our lawyers said it should be), and the same when we tried to marry. So she went back to her country and came back a bit over 3 months after. \n\nThe day of my departure came and I had everything ready to go. On the morning of the flight my documents were stolen so I was unable to travel and since it was during the vacations period the bureaucratic procedures in my country work very slowly so my entry was delayed, first for 2 weeks and then the human resources told me it was for a month for their own internal procedures. \n\nBack to the girlfriend situation. She had gone to her country and after a few weeks we found out she was pregnant. We decided to keep the pregnancy as she would have a lot of difficulty having a kid later on as she has PCOS. She came back to my country 2 days before my departure date and, it could be from the stress of changing countries, she had a miscarriage. It affected her brutally due to the high probability of not being able to have kids later on, she went out of her mind and made up her mind that she would be unable to feel ok if we went due to what happened as she would be deeply depressed and be very isolated due to my job involving many hours out of home. \n\nGoing alone would mean she could not stay in my country either and wait until she felt better, as she came with a visa to marry and the marriage process would take long. If I went she would have to go with me against her will or go back to her country. At the time the situation was such that I had to decide between breaking the relationship, or staying.\n\nWith all the drama and my family pressure (they never wanted me to go) I panicked and sent an email explaining briefly the situation saying I couldnt go at the time and couldnt ask for another delay as it was a third one and it didnt feel right to ask for that reason (huge mistake, should have asked of course but was not thinking clearly). A few days later I sent an email asking for a delay of 2 months to try to solve the situation. I received a reply a week after saying the job was cancelled. After around a week I sent an email to the manager apologising again and explaining the situation with a bit more detail because I felt it was the least I could do.\n\nNow after around 3 months they opened a job slot that is very similar to what I had applied. I want it, a lot, and I'm a good fit for it. What I fear is that (understandably) they view me as unprofessional, that Im not trustworthy and that they doubt my commitment. I understand that, as the whole story is very complicated and the fact is that I gave my word that I would go (despite no contract being signed), and 3 times on the date that I was supposed to go I had to ask for a delay. I feel ashamed of that and I have always been a man of word, but the situation involving my family affected me too much emotionally that I didnt think clearly. I have learned my lesson now, at great cost due to the opportunities missed.\n\nWhat could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited?\n\nAt the time of the interview I was asked about my commitment and I gave my word that if they offered me the job I would go. I kept my word up to the point of the family issues. Between the time of the interview and the first starting date I was called for interviews for two jobs at a great international organization that offered even better pay and was at a better location, and for another job in switzerland that offered even better pay. I refused on the spot to keep my word. After a few months I was offered a teaching job in my city and refused for the same reason. Now I'm unemployed and with a high probability of remaining so as the job market for phds is seasonal, most job are to start in September next year.\n\nI will apply for the position, but I'm not sure on the following:\nShould I mention any of this even briefly in the cover letter?\nShould I try to show them I keep my word and this was an exception because it impacted my personal life tremendously? Should I contact the manager (would be boss) directly and mention any of this? For example by mentioning I refused the other job interviews\n\nTL DR: got a great job offer a year ago, for 3 times had to ask for delay (months) in the starting work date for family reasons (and one time for documents stolen) and the job was cancelled. Now a similar job opened and I want to apply. What could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited? In terms of the cover letter and potentially contacting the manager (would be boss) directly",

    "text": "I Hate Being a Lawyer. I've casually browsed Reddit for years, ever since my first job after law school in the Los Angeles office of a Boston-based firm.  This is my first post.  I write it in the middle of the night, unable to sleep, and dreading the fact that tomorrow (technically, today as it is after midnight) is yet another Monday at the office.\n\nI hate being a lawyer.  A lot.  Frankly, I'm not even sure what the point of this post is other than to just...get it off my chest I suppose.  I have not shared this fact with anyone, and I imagine that most people I associate with don't have any idea.  I guess that relative anonymity of Reddit is helpful in that regard.\n\nSo, why make this post now?  On some level, I have just had enough.  I couldn't sleep tonight due to extraordinary anxiety about my caseload of what I estimate to be hundreds of ongoing, complex cases.  Yes, I have associates, paralegals, and support staff helping but at the end of the day, the proverbial \"buck stops here.\"  I took my increasingly regular daily does of Xanax to try to sleep tonight, but it didn't help.  As sad as it may sound, the only thing that seems to help is literally doing more legal work.  Sick, right?\n\nAnyway, on one level I just feel trapped.  I become a lawyer about 6 years ago.  I miss the lifestyle I had before I did so; renting a room in Somerville (a suburb of Boston); driving an old Toyota when I wasn't riding on the T; having no real bills (other than law school loans, of course); and just enjoying life.  I was responsible for nobody other than myself.  Things have changed.  I have a wife and a daughter; a mortgage; my wife and I each drive luxury cars, save for our daughter's college fund, and live a relatively expensive lifestyle.  Sometimes when days get really bad I've casually looked around for other careers paths, but nothing even comes close to what I'm earning now (Base of $300k per year).\n\nAnyway, like I said, this post doesn't really have much of a point to it.  I just felt a need to vent I guess.  I work god damn near eighty hours per week 6-7 days per week, for fucking rude, demeaning, pain-in-the-ass clients; deal with ungrateful, incompetent staff; and, maybe worse yet, have to put up with quite often condescending and entirely unimpressive judicial officers.  The level of anxiety I feel these days is off the fucking charts.\n\nPlease, for whoever reads this, do not go to law school.  If you are there, leave.  Now.  Run, and run fast.  Even if you finish and join a decent firm, you will become a slave to a lockstep system that will literally own you.  It's terrible, but you will build a lifestyle around it.  And then, there you are.  Stuck, litigating with asshole lawyers over minutiae, only because you know that fill-in-the-blank bill needs to be paid.\n\nFuck this profession.  Oh my god, just fuck it.  I want out.  I went in to this profession for the money, and not any other reason.  I think that is typical of many lawyers.  Even putting aside the fact that law generally pays shit outside of Biglaw and some specialized midlaw, once you \"succeed\" in getting into one of these firms you become addicted to the money.  It simply does not fix it anymore.    \n\nMan, it's just so shitty.  I want out so badly.  Has anyone out there successfully done so?",

I thought this was the best course of action under the advisement of recent law school grads and close friends who are lawyers themselves.\n\nTo my surprise, when I asked a fellow 0L if he  wanted to catch Spider-Man in theaters before school started he replied he was too busy as he was getting ready for his SECOND prep course and had immense amounts of work. \n\nWtf?

    "text": "If women shouldn't have to explain anything when getting an abortion, and can get an abortion whenever they want, men should have the right to disown an unwanted child if the woman doesn't wants to have an abortion. Children should not be used as one sex's financial shackle to the other. After seeing a post on the front page about women never having to justify abortion, and worse, to be able to use it as a form of birth control, I feel this should also be mentioned.\n\nStory time! Sorry for the grammar and everything, English isn’t my first language.\n\nThis happened to a family member of mine. He and a girl he met slept together without using a condom. Alright, up until now I'd say screw them both, they knew what they were risking; however, they seemed mature about it. The man (Family member) couldn't financially support a child without dropping out of university. The woman wanted to keep the child for whatever reason (I think it was about morals or something along those lines), but accepted to take care of the child and sever ties with him.\n\nAlright, great yeah!? Mature, reasonable decision on both sides. The man would stay in university and the woman would take care of the child she wanted to keep with the help of her family. That should have been the end of it right? Wrong. Fast forward a couple of years. Yes, YEARS! The man is contacted again by the woman. She wants him to meet her child. I say “her” because it was decided they would sever ties years ago.\n\nAlright, I get news of this. And I'm rather a huge jerk and always assume people will act towards me as I act towards them. They want the upper hand and never do anything out of the kindness of their heart, but we’re not here to judge my character people, it’s just relevant to the story.\n\nSo I tell him not to respond, I tell him NEVER to reply to anything she sends. I explain to him that she just wants money out of this, that it’s not worth it. She’ll fuck him over because she lives in a shit town in a shit part of the country with no jobs and failed relationships and she’s seeking easy money to feed herself because she’s probably a failure.\n\nDid I tell you this family member is sentimental? Well, he is. So the woman beats me by showing him picture of that kid to him and telling him that since she told him stories of his dad the kid wants to meet him. He gets emotional and suddenly he wants to meet the kid and talks to him on skype. I knew where this was leading, he was being manipulated, but I couldn’t reach his guilt tripping mind about how this was only a ploy to get him to get more involved in the life of this kid until she would demand money. \n\nAfter a while, what do I learn about this fuckass woman from nowhere? Just before contacting the family member she had broken up with her loser junky/pusher boyfriend. It didn’t matter though, because he already went to meet that kid and see them in person (kid and woman). They live really fucking far away too. I’ll also mention that he has a good job, north of 45k a year, I just *know* where this is going. So I tell my family to somehow convince him. It fails.\n\nA couple of weeks later what does she asks? That’s right! MONEY. SHE WANTS ZE MONEY. I’m not fucking rejoicing here. This was a failure on my part, but this is only the beginning folks. So the family member says he can take care of them if they move into his town and he’ll visit often. Fair, right? He’s got a heart of gold that guy. He does all this while being married to another woman who’s understanding enough to support him through all this.\n\nWhat’s the response from fuckass woman up in nowhere city? She doesn’t want the kid to meet family member’s wife, and wants him to only have supervised visits at her own place in nowhere. She also wants the money, of course, but the kid is only a tool to get that at this point.\n\nFamily member really fucking wants the best for this kid, so he tells her he’ll accept to have the kid during the summer and pay child support. That’s not enough, she wants more money than that, so she uses the kid again, denying him visits altogether and telling the kid his father doesn’t want to help.\n\nNow, family member paid over $10 000 in lawyers’ fees getting the ball rolling to get full custody of the kid. He and his wife live in one of the big city of the province, making north of 65k a year together. They are married, have a stable life with a lot of relatives living near them. Meanwhile, fuckass hoe has no job, a string of junkie exes trying to get (fuck) her back, live in nowhere town, can’t pay the bills, and is using the kid as an emotional weapon to get money out of him. \n\nFamily court is heavily stacked against men here. You know what his lawyers told him? He has less than 50% chance of even getting custody let alone full custody. Because women, for no good reason, are heavily favored in the courts. It takes child abuse to even nudge the court towards taking the men’s side in most cases. Short of child abuse or a really strong argument by them that would blow the judge away, he’ll only get to see the kid once every two weeks and have to pay out his ass in child support while junkie woman sleeps around and never works a day in her life.\n\nThis is why men should have the right to disown a child before birth up until the time a woman cannot get an abortion anymore. Never having to pay a dime to the woman. Right now, children can be used as financial shackles on men and often are used that way. If a woman can abort a child because of financial reasons, without asking the permission of the father who might want to keep it, that father should be able to disown that child for the same reason and never be bothered by the woman again.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

    "text": "Talk radio host Michael Savage's Depressing Attempts to Demonize Feminism (Among Other Things) Hey everybody. I haven't posted here before but I thought this recollection is relevant, both in an alarming way and as an example of the kinds of anti-feminist rhetoric making waves not only on r/Men'sRights, r/the_donald and the alt-reich pits of 4chan, but also on nationwide daily conservative talk radio.\n\nAs a fiction writer intrigued by the depths of conspiratorial thinking, conservative talk radio is like a nightmare paradise. I started tuning in pre-election to try and comprehend some of the right's perspective, principally the stuff the right is being told by their media. Aside from a constant stream of slant and innuendo, and general fear-mongering, this segment from a few weeks back really stuck out.\n\nSavage's topic: \"an epidemic of false rape allegations perpetrated by radical feminists.\" Fitting neatly with the \"Look at what's happening to our poor boys!\" trope, he asked for callers to relay experiences of faked accusations for the purpose of slander and character assassination. His first caller was a woman in tears. She was barely able to speak about experiencing a rape in her youth that she was never able to get herself to publicly admit before. It was very hard to hear, particularly when Savage was less than accepting at first, asking her why she never came forward, asking what she hoped to get out of admitting it now. Eventually he relented and wound the conservation toward some notion of an older, better America where \"your brothers would take care of it.\" \n\nThe next caller was a guy who was utterly on board with Savage's thesis. He said that his sister-in-law cooked up a story about him molesting her kids, even coaching them to lie to lawyers, in order to discredit him and get him fired from his job (which was successful.) When asked why she would do this, he said \"she just didn't like me\" (the most suspect sentence I've ever heard, BTW). Regardless, this fakery, while manipulative and wrong, had nothing to do with feminism and/or sexual assault of feminists. So Savage was 0 for 2 on his big evil topic. \n\nThe third was a guy who was raped while attending a christian monastery. It was another sobering discussion of sexual assault and the effects it has on the body and mind, denial, acceptance, the unstable road to recovery, etc. \n\nCaller after caller...zero examples of false rape allegations. The segment concluded with a nurse who specialized in processing rape victims, she laid out all the gory details of examination, while Savage tried to derail her data and facts with ideas like \"Well if there's no clear DNA evidence, the claim must not be believed, right?\" He didn't get far on this tract. Strangely, they ended up on mutual terms when ascribing a rise in rape incidents and rape culture to violent video games, violence in films and, both inherently racist and lazy, on rap music like Kanye West. The segment trailed off into Savage basically thanking his audience for a frank discussion of a very hard topic, and then the station was barraged by ads. \n\nConsidering where things ended up, it was easy to forget how it began-- Savage wanted to hear about devious man-hating and man-destruction by means of what he sees as a pivotal radical feminist tool, the pointed finger of accusation and the presumed guilt of the men being accused. But when exposed to real people in the audience, with real experiences, there was a near unanimous 180 degree turn. As brutal and frightening as his initial topic was, and how horrific it is that such concepts are preached to the masses as being some epidemic feminazi plot, he totally failed. It was heartening in a grim way. \n\nAnyway, thought I would share this attempt to demonize feminism, particularly because the response was not only lackluster but such a reversal. Other such BS, particularly online, gets hateful and vile very quickly.",

    "text": "I'm frustrated as hell. How do people get/find ridiculously well-paying under-the-table jobs that require little work? (Example inside) I'm frustrated folks.\n\nI won't go into the details about who I am just to save time because I have to head off to my $10-an-hour bust-my-balls job in about 45 minutes.\n\nMy girlfriend, who has had a lot of trouble looking for jobs in the past, got a job back around... October/November.\n\nShe INITIALLY went in to apply for a Starbucks position. The manager there just HAPPENED to be a rather entrepreneurial gentleman who had a whole bunch of little businesses up his sleeves.\n\nApparently, during the interview, he just flat out offered my girlfriend a job posting his sports related stuff on eBay for like... $25-$30 an hour (estimated but not fixed). According to her, it's never very hard work either. She's in front of a computer screen at the office all night. She has a lot of computer background (not technical background) because she ran a small Etsy store for her Perler bead creations for a very short time. She's a graduate massage therapist and nothing beyond that. In her words, she doesn't really have any significant outstanding skills aside from texture design (from her days of being an IMVU developer) and just being an artist in general. She's also never had any job experience beyond her self-employment and babysitting/dogsitting.\n\nFast forward to the week before Christmas, dude offers her a job doing tours at a local retirement home in order to get clients saying she could make potentially $5,000 a day in commission alone.\n\nHaven't heard much about the offer since, but that job aside, how to hell do you find these people that just want to give you a crap ton of money to do their lazy work?\n\nI put it that way because the way she describes her boss, he's tired. He's in his 50's, runs a lot of businesses, and just hires people to do the standard work; essentially, his employees are what automates his business.\n\nThe dude is just flat-out loaded (supposedly). Aside from the suspected $25-$30 an hour, he'll randomly just pay her like... $500 a night if he feels like she and the other employees did good work.\n\n(Just for the record, I've been up and down the gambit of 'the-creepy-old-man-who-simply-wanted-a-pretty-girl-working-for-him thing'. After months of skepticism, I'm convinced he's not up to anything skeevy.)\n\nI'm an A+ certified technician, with excellent Microsoft Office skills  (particularly Excel) just to name something and has a shit ton of computer experience outside of that, who has worked for the Post Office, Edible Arrangement, a small cafe, and currently a retail store. I'm gotten standard minimum wage for back-breaking work. (Back breaking because I'm a rather heavyset guy with quite a few medical issues). Everytime she tells me about her job, I can't help but get jealous.\n\nI've told her many times that it doesn't bother me if she ends up making more than me right nor or in the future, but I've always had a goal of wanting to be a supplier.\n\nI'm in a shitty situation at home where my family is somehow expecting me to move out on $150 a month (After bills and food) while being a full time student in Network Administration WHILE I have a Mom who refuses to look for work and insists on living off of social security. I desperately want to be on my own and move out with my girlfriend but $150 a month won't cut it and because I've had no financial basis to grow upon because my Mom refuses to look for work, I'm on my own here.\n\nI'm frustrated. I'm tired. I seemingly couldn't stumble upon a job if I had a Genie's Lamp.\n\nAside from my girlfriend, how in the bloody hell do people stumble onto jobs like these?\n\nI need a freaking break. The job my girlfriend has is like... my dream entry-level job. Doing something I love (anything computer related) for excellent pay with minimum hours so I can focus on school. (My girlfriend is no longer in school, BTW. She graduated years ago.)\n\nI apologize for the 'Dear Diary' like post. I'm frustrated.",

    "text": "I was groomed and molested as a teenager I thought about a throwaway but screw it. \n\nFrom the ages of 12 to 16, I was groomed and molested by a family member. While he wasn't blood relation, I still consider it an act of incest because he married into my family when I was about 2 or 3 and watched me grow up. \n\nWhen I was 16, he was arrested. It's actually been about 7 years to the day and I feel like sharing in the wake of that girl being found alive in California after being kidnapped by an older man who groomed her. \n\nMy abuser believed we were in love. He believed that I had fallen for him and that I would marry him after I turned 18 and we would be together. He told his family he was no longer in love with the family member of mine he married and had met someone else. \n\nI lived every day in fear. I didn't sleep because I was afraid he would rape me if I was asleep. My food intake was monitored (one serving of dinner is a sign of a healthy girl; two is a sign of a fatty little piggy) and I was not allowed to date. Only certain friends could come over and I couldn't go to friends' houses if boys were there. \n\nHe once grounded me for two weeks because I wouldn't let him touch and kiss my breasts. I was 14. \n\nI couldn't wear makeup, because who am I trying to impress? No shorts in 100+ degree weather because obviously only whores wear shorts. No dresses. \n\nI had several pairs of underwear go missing in that time period. I did my own laundry and stuff I swore was in the dryer never showed up again. \n\nWhen I was being groomed, my abuser cherry picked the parts of my personality he wanted to keep. I was punished for teenage rebellion, punished for trying to explore my personality (am I a goth? am I punk? maybe I'm an artist!), but praises for being childlike and being a homebody. \n\nAlso, weirdly? Memes. My abuser loved that I loved memes. \n\nAfter he was sent away-- wait, real quick, when he called his parents while he was in jail, the court had a recording of his dad going \"you got that girl of yours into trouble, didn't you?\"\n\nBut after he was sent away, I was...free. I didn't have to be the girl he wanted (he had a special nickname for me and I wrote a lot of emo poetry about that girl being dead) and I could be the girl I wanted to be!!\n\nI kept parts of who I had to be. I'm a homebody. I still talk quiet on the phone for personal calls because I'm still used to the fear that the calls are being listened in on. I like memes, hence why I'm on Reddit. \n\nI filled the gaps in my personality with what I wanted. I'm sarcastic. I tell Dad Jokes. I can be melodramatic. I wear too much lipstick. I wear short shorts in the summer and all my underwear is accounted for. My body belongs to me now and forever. \n\nI showed up to his trial dressed in everything he hated. I wore a suit, trousers and a tie with a vest and a white button down with a blazer. It was the beginning of August and I thought heat stroke would get me but I had a point to prove. I pulled my hair back in the tightest bun I could, short of giving myself a face-lift-- I had to wear my hair long and down, or else he would accuse me of being a prude and laugh at me. Black eyeliner. Gold eyeshadow. (\"don't wear that eyeshadow anymore. it makes you look ugly.\") I wore so much red lipstick that I think it was on my teeth. \n\nI was hurt by somebody who believed he loved me. He wanted to marry me and have a family with me. He confessed to wanting to get me pregnant so I would have his children. He knew my bra size and that I slept without pants on. Because he said he loved me. And he told himself that I loved him. \n\nI had parts of myself deleted and overwritten by someone who said he loved me. I was hurt by someone who wanted to marry me. I was threatened with homelessness and had food withheld by someone who wanted to put a baby in me. \n\nBut I made it. My love life is shit, but I think that's for different reasons. I eat ice cream. I'm 30 pounds heavier than I was when he was around, which means I'm no longer 30 pounds underweight. \n\nI'm alive. And so are you all who've gone through the same or similar things.",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "The Meaning of Feminine When I think of feminine, I first think of shape, of cinched waists and pencil skirts. Heels to elongate, show the tone of the calf and give a little perk to the ass. I think of silhouette and shadow, cleavage and rounded edges. Curve. Hourglass. Lithe muscles and long spine. Thin fingers. Thin everything.\n\nThen I think of long hair and long eyelashes. Red lips and big eyes. Painted nails, rosy cheeks, lined eyes, big smiles, ringed fingers, collar bones, shaved legs, small waists, and perfect brows. \n\nI think of aesthetics first. Always what we look like, how we please the eye. Or more, accurately, how we should please the eye.\n\n\"Short hair is breaking convention. She must be trying to make some kind of statement.\"\n\n\"Apple shapes are just unlucky, poor girl.\"\n\n\"Doesn't shave her legs? Clearly some kind of crazy hippie who doesn't like boys.\"\n\n\"Don't like wearing lipstick? Well, that's OK, it's not for everyone - but it would look really good on you, you should try it!\"\n\n\"If she just lost 20 pounds, she'd be so pretty.\"\n\nNext, I think of feminine in terms of sound. The pitch of the voice: high, asking. Not too loud. Giggles. The word \"like\" as a filler, transition, or replacement.\n\nA feminine woman is polite. Content. In control of herself but no one else. Demure. Pleasing. Proper. Excellent posture. She doesn't curse, drink beer or whiskey, get loud or passionate, burp, fart, or take a shit - giving the impression that her body works differently than a man's. \n\nIn my mind, being feminine is boring but respectful. Safe. Feminine is sweet, supportive, encouraging. Feminine is never being angered, or at least not letting it show. Feminine is all teeth and perfect skin. \n\nThese are the things that automatically come to mind when I force myself to really focus on the word and concept of feminine, usually during my long subway rides to work when I most often get lost in these types of thoughts. But then I’ll sit up in my subway seat, shoulders pressed up against the shoulders of my fellow commuters, and think to myself, “But why? Why do I think of these things when I focus on the word feminine? Where does that come from?” The answer comes easily, as it is usually the same answer whenever I ask myself why my subconscious is full of unsolicited information about social or gender norms. I believe society, essentially just living life, has taught me what feminine means.\n\nBut, I want to go deeper than that. Ask, where did all of this originate before it got to me, sneaking into my brain and influencing my perception of the world and others? What's the purpose of feminine, as a concept? Or, if not a purpose, then the product of what cause? I know it is human nature to categorize things but how has feminine come so far as a concept?!\nI have all of the questions. \n\nLet’s start simply. Why do we get our nails done? Do our hair? Dress nicely?\n\nWithout doing the research I probably should, my guess is that, at some point around the 1920s, culture shifted, allowing for a more materialistic and flashy lifestyle, particularly for those with money. Companies marketed to this new, consumerist society and women were allowed to adorn themselves, show a little skin, appeal to the opposite sex and show just how feminine they could be - show their worth, if you will. Going further back, women have been historically showcased for their aesthetic beauty - reclining on 16th century sofas for male artists who painted their naked form. Fancy men would pay top dollar to hang these on their wall to stare at, share with their other fancy friends, and objectify. Now, we hang these fancy paintings in fancy museums and stare at them with our loved ones, discussing their history and aesthetic appeal as if we don't still do the same thing on the cover of every fashion magazine.\n\nShall we venture even further back, to a time when women were gatherers and baby-makers, men hunters and warriors? Was feminine an important concept in this time? Maybe in a literal sense, women being female with womanly body parts that allowed for procreation. But that isn’t the very deep and complicated sense of feminine that we have now. It seems to have evolved over time and become something we know of but don’t really think about. Until now of course because I’m making you. Don’t fight it. It’ll be great.\n\nIn our modern times, women describe many reasons for adorning themselves with clothes and polish and highlights and makeup. Some say they do it to attract a man or to keep their man happy and committed. Others say they do it for other women, because only other women really appreciate the effort and effect. Some say they do it for themselves and no one else. Is this possibly true? No one else? I don't buy it. Feminine is too deeply ingrained into the concept of womanhood and we primarily do these things to fit in, because we understand the comfort and convenience of aligning with the crowd. (For those women out there who truly curate a look for themselves and no one else, I applaud you. I'm sure getting to that place was not easy, defying societal norms in that way. I am truly impressed and we should all be paying more attention.)\n\nOnce, when I was young, I was looking at my fingernails like this: (image of a hand, palm up, fingers curled in to show the nails)\n\nMy dad stopped me, told me that girls don't look at their fingernails like that, only boys do. Girls look at their fingernails like this: (image of the back of a flat hand, nails displayed)\n\nIt's more feminine, he said.\n\nHow did my dad know this? Why did he think this was important enough to teach me?\n\nI assume it is because seeing me check my nails the \"boys\" way seemed visually wrong to him and a parent's instinct is to correct. Parents guide and normalize their children so they will be socially appropriate and accepted. No one wants their child to be the one with their elbows on the table, chewing their food with their mouths open and a finger up their nose. But at what point do we realize that the line separating masculine and feminine is mostly arbitrary?\n\nThings that are innately female:\n-Getting your period\n-Giving birth (except for sea horses)\n-Going through menopause\n\nThings that are innately male:\n-Testerone - basically, the ability to put on quite a bit of muscle mass\n-Receding hair lines\n-Erections\n-Ejaculation\n-Beards\n\nAnd even some of those things exist across gender lines in some cases!\n\nI can't think of too many other things that are truly innate. My stance is that most things are imparted by society, slowly over the course of our brain development - from birth to roughly the age of 25.\n\nMen are not innate wood choppers, mathematicians, and decision-makers. They were taught to do these things well, told that they would be good at them. So, inevitably, many men did these things and did them well for a very long time. OK, so maybe men are good at chopping wood because of the whole muscle mass thing but you get my point. \n\nWomen are not innate nurturers (future post), decorators, and submissive followers. They were taught to do these things, told they would be good at them - or, at least, that this was their lot in life and it didn't really matter if they were good at much of anything. Women, in a very general sense, have nurtured, decorated (themselves and their homes), and submissively followed men very well for a very long time.\n\nBut things change.\n\nNow, some women stay late at the lab and some men pack their kid's lunches and pick them up from school. Some women don’t marry and focus on their passion while some men happily cook delicious family meals each evening. Some women don’t wear make-up and prefer pants to skirts and dresses while some men really hate getting dirty and love a spotless bathroom floor.\n\nAnd we get to decide to label these, call one feminine and the other masculine. We get to decide if we want these actions to have names associated with gender, or anything. We are society and we can choose to stop categorizing what people with penises do and look like and sound like vs. what people with vaginas do and look like and sound like.",

    "text": "Should I become a Software Developer or a Tattoo Artist? I've recently turned 20 and realised that now is a great time to start moving my career forward. I've been working as a graphic designer at the same place for 3 years now and it's getting a bit stale with not much more potential. I've handed in my notice to leave in April. My plan was to go freelance offering graphic & web design. I was pretty confident about doing this until my dad told me that he doesn't think that it's a great idea and that I should get a real job...\n\n\nSo with my confidence a little knocked, I've looked at this as a good time to maybe have a change of career path. I've narrowed it down to a couple of options but I would appreciate any advice anyone has to offer as I'm having a really hard time deciding what is the right choice for me.\n\n\nOne of the career paths I have found interesting is programming. Which you probably get a lot of on this sub. I particularly like the app development side of it. I love the idea of a possibility of working in the game industry. I think there's a demand for software developers in London at the moment, which is reassuring. From what I've read I match the criteria for the kind of guy who would enjoy programming e.g. enjoy logical thinking, creative, enjoy solving problems. I've always been obsessed with technology and I think that programming is something that I would be good at. However, my worry with becoming a developer is that I might find it mundane and I feel like I might be so tempted to do it just for the potential to earn a huge paycheck. It would be nice to from someone who has any experience of this?\n\n\nThen my other option on a pretty different end of the scale is becoming a tattoo artist. I think this would suit my personality quite well, it's a lot more laid back, obviously a creative industry and has potential to make a good living. I understand that it's not an easy industry to succeed in, but I do know a couple of tattoo artists who I think could help me. I've always been naturally artistic and a fast learner, so I feel that this is also something that I would be good at. I feel that I would much prefer the lifestyle of this career path. With a typical day of 6 hours, it's fewer hours (kinda lazy I know but I would like to still have a life!) and the possibility to run my own business someday. \n\n\nOr I could just find another job in graphic & design. Or even not listen to my old man and go freelance! It's a tough one but I'm really struggling to find the right answer for me at the moment and I feel that this is the best place for me to hear some good advice. I appreciate any advice, would be great if I could get some advice from people in either industry. Kind of a long shot I know, but worth a try. Apologies for going on about myself for so long, I hope this hasn't been too boring of a post. Thanks for your time.",

    "text": "Sharing my personal story about a my career change from chef to web developer Hey there. I made a career change into web development in 2015, and before that, I worked as a chef. I often get asked how I did it, and if I have any advice for new and aspiring developers. \n\nI originally wrote this as an article on my website, but I wanted to post some of it here to give some possible insight and inspiration to anyone who doesn't want to go back to school, and would like to read someone's personal story about the actual steps they took to land their first job without a degree or experience. Basically:\n\n- A little about myself\n- How I fell into the wrong career for me\n- How I decided on the right one\n- Steps I took to land my first job in the field\n\nThroughout this story you will find the answers to some of the common questions I’ve received, such as \"how did you land your first job?\", \"what was the technical interview like?\", \"what technologies did you know starting out?\", \"how long did it take?\" and \"what was the hardest part?\".\n\nI'm 27, and it took 10 months to complete my journey.\n\n([Here is the original post.](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-i-made-a-career-change-into-web-development/))\n\n### About me\n\nI was born in ’89 and grew up a shy, eccentric girl in the suburbs of Chicago, where I spent most of my childhood playing Super Nintendo and drawing. I discovered the Internet in 1998 when my brother Nick took me to the public library, where they had computers running Netscape Navigator.\n\nI still vividly remember the first day I ever used the ‘Net (that’s what we called it back then) – that very day I learned the meaning of \"lol\", made my first E-Mail address, and discovered how easy it was to meet new people who share my interests. My brother taught me a few basic lines of HTML and I took it from there. Thanks to free hosting on GeoCities, I could make websites about anything I wanted – myself, Digimon, Animorphs, myself, clans and guilds for the silly games I played, obscure ’80s music, accordions, and more. I discovered I could even draw on MS Paint at home and transfer it to the Internet via floppy disk. And a new hobby was born.\n\nSo how did I learn to make those websites? I would just copy the source of other websites I liked, open up Notepad and randomly change things here and there until it started doing what I wanted. Complete trial and error. In the beginning, I couldn’t figure out how to copy and paste the source code, so I had to type everything out myself. I never once studied coding in any capacity in this time, and I couldn’t tell you a CSS class from an ID, what a variable is, or the definition of an HTML tag.\n\nMy life mostly continued along the same path until the end of high school.\n\n### Falling into the wrong career\n\nAt seventeen, right out of high school, I certainly didn’t have the slightest clue what I wanted to be when I \"grew up\". Making websites as a career wasn’t even a shadow of a thought in my head. I always assumed I would go into some sort of artistic or graphic design career, but what I wanted to do much more than that was travel and see the world. Since there was no official job that pays you to explore other cultures, I wasn’t content with any career path, and I didn’t research any options for myself.\n\nYet whether we put a great deal of thought into our future or not, life moves forward, and decisions are made. Since I had no plans, I took the first offer that came along, which was a \"free ride\" to a university’s Culinary Arts program based on some test scores I had. I didn’t really know anything about the culinary industry, but I enjoyed cooking a lot, and maybe I could even use it to travel, so why not?\n\nI did an accelerated Bachelor’s program, graduated and worked several jobs in the field from prep and line cook to banquet chef to culinary manager and chef. I won’t bother going into detail about working in the kitchen, but I will say it taught me an immense amount about hard work, managing stress, and being a leader.\n\nAfter eight years wearing many hats in the industry, I knew it was time to move on. There is quote that roughly goes, \"change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change\", and that’s the best way I can summarize my reasons for deciding to find a new career.\n\n### Deciding on the right career\n\nAlthough I had never been unemployed, the situation for me at my final chef job in 2014 was bad enough that I put in my two weeks notice without having another job lined up. I knew I wanted to do something different with my life, but I had no idea what. I very quickly realized I didn’t want to any of the jobs that a culinary career would aid me in.\n\nI bought the book What Color Is Your Parachute, a book about finding the right career for you through doing a lot of exercises and writing. I also found a book that had you take timed tests to find out your natural aptitudes and matches you to careers that fit well with those natural skills. I wanted to understand myself, and find a career I could be content with that would also sustain me.\n\nArmed with those books and a ukulele, I drove to a campsite a few hours away and spent the next week in seclusion, hiking around all day and going through some of the exercises in the career books.\n\nI will tell you right now – neither of those books told me what to do or gave me the magical answer. Soul searching is a lot of hard work and takes a lot of time, and it’s really difficult to focus and be honest with yourself about who you are, vs. who you want to be.\n\nHowever, the books gave me some guidance and helped me ask the right questions and learn some things about myself. I started coming to the same conclusions over and over again. Exercises would ask what you enjoy doing, what you’re good at, and what you can do for long periods of time without noticing it, and \"making websites\" was always among my answers. My greatest skill according to the timed tests is quickly scanning information, which made me realize I have a natural aptitude towards finding syntax errors in code, and fast problem solving.\n\nAll of that eventually helped me eventually land on \"some sort of graphic design, web design, or coding, as long as I don’t have to go back to school\".\n\n### Steps I took to land my first web job\n\nAt this point, I was newly unemployed, without a plan, and with a resume full of culinary work experience and schooling. While I was still figuring out a basic idea of what I wanted to do, I started applying to all sorts of jobs – data entry, temp jobs, manufacturing, warehouse work – literally anything that wasn’t a kitchen job or retail that I might be able to do without a related degree. Despite filling out dozens of online job applications, I didn’t get a single response to anything. Although this was madly frustrating at the time, I can look back on it now and be happy I didn’t settle for just any job.\n\nThey always say you should never burn any bridges, always maintain a good relationship with your employers and leave on good terms, and I’m glad I always did. My money was running out, and I had no job prospects, but I called one of my old companies up and they gave me a chef job right away. Although this was a full time, 60-hour-a-week job, I was determined to change careers eventually.\n\nI started going on Craigslist and looking for the cheapest logo design, graphic design, or web design work I could find. I had no portfolio and no experience, but I was persistent and eventually I found someone who would pay me to make some websites and do some odd jobs. I built a few one-page websites, for which I was paid $200/$300 dollars each. I also designed a logo, which made me $100, and did some little updates here and there for a small fee.\n\nI was doing this after work, between the hours of 9pm and 4am, before the next day’s 10 hour shift. In order to make a living and do something new, I had to sacrifice a lot of sleep and social activity. When I began all this, I had a very limited amount of outdated knowledge on HTML and CSS, and had simple Photoshop skills. During down time at work, I would browse Quora questions and answers about web development, and without even knowing it I was learning all about the industry.\n\nThe tipping point for me was meeting someone who had their own small business, and was willing to take on an unpaid intern. A guy who was at the time a weekend bartender at the restaurant I worked at, offered me the internship. I did something that was extremely difficult for me, and left my stable chef position to intern in the morning at his company and work a night job cooking at NAMCO’s Pac-Man themed restaurant.\n\nDuring that time, I learned about WordPress, Git, Sass, setting up local server environments, basic PHP and JavaScript, and using the command line – all things I had never experienced before. I began this blog during that time to document some of the things that I was learning. I continued applying to jobs online, still through Craigslist, and now I had a few websites and an internship to put on my resume. I applied for a junior web developer job, and after an interview, some personality tests, and a weekend coding test, I received my first job offer!\n\nFor my coding test, I had to make a responsive navigation from scratch. This was a huge challenge for me, because I was only vaguely aware of responsive design and had only ever used Bootstrap to create navigations. Instead of just creating one, I made three separate designs, going above and beyond what was expected of me and showing the company I was willing to learn quickly and put forth extra effort.\n\n### Summary\n\n**tl;dr**\n\n- I had a bit of an edge over somebody starting from scratch with web development, because I made websites for fun as a child.\n- I went to college for a career that wasn’t right for me, but I learned a lot about myself and life, as well as having a great appreciation for what I do now.\n- The hardest part of all was doing the necessary soul searching to try to figure out what would be the right career for me, both in natural aptitude and enjoyability.\n- While still working my original career, I found odd jobs through Craigslist in the web development industry to begin building up my resume and learning, while still making money.\n- I did a three month unpaid internship while working a night job when I became really serious about my career change.\n-  The biggest thing that helped me was creating my blog, a place where I documented all the things I learned.\n- I applied for jobs online while continuing to study, learn, and create, and eventually I was able to land a full-time junior web developer role.\n\nI would not necessarily recommend the way I learned to anyone else, and I’m sure a lot of self-taught developers would say the same.\n\nMy dream is to summarize everything I’ve learned into an effective web development course from scratch for beginners, so they don’t have to search through as many poor and outdated tutorials as I did. However, problem solving and putting yourself out there to build things will always be an essential part of becoming a web developer as well.\n\n**The biggest thing I can recommend is to create a blog to document everything you learn. If you can explain it, you can do it.**",

    "text": "I always hate it when a White person tries arguing that they have \"earned\" their award whenever a Black person brings up how unfair it is that our work is overlooked and not rewarded even when we've worked harder at something. I remember arguing a post about Eminem weeks ago with some fan about how  it doesn't seem right that White artists like Eminem win awards on BET when the network was created by and for Black people. Every time I mentioned some examples, and mentioned all the best Black rappers that we've listened to over the years, Tupac, Biggie, Common, Nas, any of them, these guys would argue that Eminem is better than all of them regardless or \"one of the best MCs\", and Tupac and Biggie are only heralded because they are dead. I beg to differ. There are plenty of dead rappers know of, but Tupac and Biggie are famous because their work spoke of real, relateable issues and are timeless. This guy argued that Eminem gets nominated and awarded at BET because he \"earned it\".\nLook, Eminem is a great rapper, sure, and yes, I know BET is not owned by a Black man anymore, hasn't been for years. But, I just hate the thought of people, especially White people thinking that they deserve to get noticed all the time for their merits over minorities because they \"earned it\". That's BS. I hate it when someone calls Eminem the \"King of Hip-Hop/Rap\" as if the Black artists that came before him aren't more deserving of that title. It's like how Elvis became known as the \"King of Rock n Roll\" when artists like Nat King Cole and Chuck Berry were doing rock n roll way before he did. Also Eminem is cool, I like him, but he's pretty overrated.\n\nAnd all they can say and do is try to dismiss the great Black rappers all the time, but praise the White ones as \"original\" and \"relateable\". Because they don't care; they just think that anything they do that mimics what other people have done for years automatically makes them the best at it or deserving of an award over other hard workers in that genre who know our issues and struggles more.",

    "text": "Dealing with Microaggressions from Liberal, POC Friends. Hey everyone. First off, long time lurker, first time posting.\n\nI just got back from hanging out with some friends of mine and the entire ride home I just felt like I needed to vent to someone (or something) so I guess here it is.\n\nI am a speech and debate competitor, and for those unfamiliar, speech and debate is an incredibly liberal space. I feel like it's often on the forefront of liberal thought and artistic expression. The conversations that go on within speech and debate circles are often incredibly liberal and fight for marginalized groups, and I'd say a good 90% of speeches and performances out there are politically skewed. Example of this would be speeches about: BLM, LGBTQA+ issues, fighting for the rights of those who are not able-bodied, raising a light to lynchings that have been happening in 2016-17, etc etc.\n\nI was out with a group of friends from the speech community, and were trying to decide where to eat. I suggested Mexican food, but my friend wasn't trying to eat Mexican food tonight. All of a sudden, this friend, we'll call them \"K,\" said \"Fine, how about let's go eat at a Korean place then?\" And then K looked at me, followed by a silence in the group. Then K said \"Or a Japanese place. Or whatever.\" I hadn't seen K in a long time, so this was basically him trying to remember where I was from. Thankfully, another friend of mine said \"You can't just be coming for people like that,\" to which K responded with \"well no, don't get me wrong, I love rice.\" \n\nNow, K is an African man from Ghana, has been living here for years, and knows full well the brunt of racism. Not only that, but he fights on behalf of PoC and marginalized peoples in the speech and debate community. But here he is, openly disrespecting me and saying some pretty messed up stuff in front of all of us. \n\nI ended up brushing it off and didn't say anything. I think it was a mix of shock and my cultural instinct to preserve social harmony that kept me from going off on them for being so incredibly rude and racist. \n\nBut a huge part of it was also a part of me that still has not learned to call people out when they say something that's not okay. People have said things like this to me all of my life, and I was always told to lay low and not create a scene. But I'm absolutely tired of it. And I'm going to do my absolute best to call it out, no matter who is saying it. I can't only be capable of educating and telling off blatantly racist and ignorant people. I need to be able to have a conversation with even people who I perceive to be intelligent liberals, without a racist bone in their body. \n\nI felt that K wanted to apologize the rest of the night, but didn't know how to approach it. They took a breath to say something a couple of times, but didn't really end up saying anything. I hope that the next time I see them, I'll be able to have a conversation with them about it. Till then, I'm going to stay as strong as I can and understand that we all have learning to do.\n\nTL;DR: An African friend of mine said some borderline racist, microaggression-y stuff to me today. I didn't end up saying anything. I'm going to be better in the future.",

She needed some quality photos for her school’s yearbook and approached me to take them.  She asked me to take photos appropriate to the yearbook.  Not once did she ever request any nudity or anything else inappropriate.  She had an after school job and enough money to pay my rates.  Everything seemed completely legit.  Of course, I was well aware of the stereotypes that would brand me some kind of sick perv if I photographed a teenage girl.  I therefore turned to other photographers for advice on putting together a contract that would protect me legally.  She wanted a photos of her together with her horse.  There would be photos of her riding it, grooming it, and just standing beside it.  Nothing wrong with that, of course.  I still wanted a contract to protect me legally so that I would not end up falsely accused of any wrongdoing.  A protective instinct kicked in because I knew how hyper-negative people get toward men, especially a man with a camera.  \n\nI asked other photographers on a photography forum online if there were some kind of standard protective contract I could use.  Some photographers responded with good advice on where I could get such a thing.  Some also said I should require at least one parent present at the shoot.  Good advice.  However, others went berserk, accusing me of being some kind of perv out to rape that girl.  One asshole claimed that if it were his daughter he would immediately contact the police and the courts and get a restraining order against me.  He acted like I had proposed to make kiddie porn.  We’re talking about a photo shoot of a fully clothed girl in normal pictures with her horse – feeding it, riding it, normal stuff.  These were photos that were appropriate to a high school yearbook.  \n\nThese male-bashing bigots totally ignored my explanation of the content of the shoot and just assumed I would ask her to take her clothes off and do pervy things and that it would end with me raping her.  No amount of setting the record straight did any good.  It was unreal the hateful assumptions people made.  Some photographers came to my defense, appalled as I was at the overreaction.  Some correctly said that photographers photograph all ages.  Duh.  It totally depends on the content of the photos as to whether it’s appropriate.  It’s unreal how some people heard “fully clothed girl riding a horse” and translated that to “perv raping a teenager.”  \n\nI ended up doing the shoot, no thanks to the male-bashing bigots.  It went great.  I had a liability contract and I had her father present at the shoot.  Great guy, and great girl.  They were awesome people.  Neither of them made any of the absurd assumptions some idiots had made.  This was a case of a young woman who had earned her own money at a job and had chosen to spend it on some high quality photos.  Nothing more.  It’s unreal how some people will twist something like that into something sick.  \n\nOther photographers have told me about similar situations where they’re assumed to be some kind of perv because they have a camera with a telephoto lens.  If you’re a man and you take a high-end camera to a beach, you risk getting pestered and even arrested by police.  That’s a reason why I won’t even do beach photography.  Nowadays, I won’t even photograph someone who’s underage unless I know the people really well.  I was lucky at this shoot that they turned out to be terrific people, but if I had gotten the witch hunt idiots, it could have been dangerous for me.  I’m 100 percent certain if I were a woman, the whole overreaction and branding me as some kind of creep or perv would never have gone down.  “Girl with her horse” – he must be a sicko.  It’s unreal.",

(my experience with waxing salons) I'll try to keep this brief:\n\n  I'm an artist and have been subsidizing my income by working as an art model for a few years.  Because of this, I have to take extra steps to be fully groomed.  This involves waxing and shaving.  Because there are certain areas that one can not easily reach on ones body, I decided at one point that I would pay a professional to do certain things for me.\n\nI got turned down by about a dozen (no exaggeration;  It might have been more in fact) salons that refused to provide the service for men.  One woman actually said to me, \"No, we don't do Man-zilians (Brazilians for men).\"  I was basically given the boot by tons of places that said \"women only.\"  Turns out most of these salons don't like to serve men because they think we're all a bunch of perverts coming in for the wrong reasons.  It was near impossible, but I had to get it done.  I spent almost a week and a half looking for a place, and it was getting incredibly embarrassing for me (this was what discrimination actually feels like).  I finally found someone who would provide the service to me. \n\n*side note: She was nice, but what I found ironic was that while she was performing the waxing [we had a lengthy discussion about news], the topic of Rachel Dolezal came up and she said something about how women already have it much harder than men.  I didn't know how to react, given the circumstances*",

    "text": "Woman Excerpt from *All Things Considered* by G.K. Chesterton, Chapter 12:\n\n>\"Would not our women be spared the drudgery of cooking and all its attendant worries, leaving them free for higher culture?\" The first thing that occurs to me to say about this is very simple, and is, I imagine, a part of all our experience. If my correspondent can find any way of preventing women from worrying, he will indeed be a remarkable man. I think the matter is a much deeper one. First of all, my correspondent overlooks a distinction which is elementary in our human nature. Theoretically, I suppose, every one would like to be freed from worries. But nobody in the world would always like to be freed from worrying occupations. I should very much like (as far as my feelings at the moment go) to be free from the consuming nuisance of writing this article. But it does not follow that I should like to be free from the consuming nuisance of being a journalist. **Because we are worried about a thing, it does not follow that we are not interested in it. The truth is the other way. If we are not interested, why on earth should we be worried? Women are worried about housekeeping, but those that are most interested are the most worried.** Women are still more worried about their husbands and their children. And I suppose if we strangled the children and poleaxed the husbands it would leave women free for higher culture. That is, it would leave them free to begin to worry about that. For women would worry about higher culture as much as they worry about everything else.\n>\n>I believe this way of talking about women and their higher culture is almost entirely a growth of the classes which (unlike the journalistic class to which I belong) have always a reasonable amount of money. One odd thing I specially notice. Those who write like this seem entirely to forget the existence of the working and wage-earning classes. **They say eternally, like my correspondent, that the ordinary woman is always a drudge. And what, in the name of the Nine Gods, is the ordinary man? These people seem to think that the ordinary man is a Cabinet Minister. They are always talking about man going forth to wield power, to carve his own way, to stamp his individuality on the world, to command and to be obeyed. This may be true of a certain class. Dukes, perhaps, are not drudges; but, then, neither are Duchesses.** The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Smart Set are quite free for the higher culture, which consists chiefly of motoring and Bridge. But the ordinary man who typifies and constitutes the millions that make up our civilisation is no more free for the higher culture than his wife is.\n>\n>Indeed, he is not so free. **Of the two sexes the woman is in the more powerful position. For the average woman is at the head of something with which she can do as she likes; the average man has to obey orders and do nothing else.** He has to put one dull brick on another dull brick, and do nothing else; he has to add one dull figure to another dull figure, and do nothing else. The woman's world is a small one, perhaps, but she can alter it. **The woman can tell the tradesman with whom she deals some realistic things about himself. The clerk who does this to the manager generally gets the sack, or shall we say (to avoid the vulgarism), finds himself free for higher culture.** Above all, as I said in my previous article, the woman does work which is in some small degree creative and individual. She can put the flowers or the furniture in fancy arrangements of her own. I fear the bricklayer cannot put the bricks in fancy arrangements of his own, without disaster to himself and others. If the woman is only putting a patch into a carpet, she can choose the thing with regard to colour. I fear it would not do for the office boy dispatching a parcel to choose his stamps with a view to colour; to prefer the tender mauve of the sixpenny to the crude scarlet of the penny stamp. A woman cooking may not always cook artistically; still she can cook artistically. She can introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the composition of a soup. The clerk is not encouraged to introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the figures in a ledger.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that I have my disagreements with Chesterton (he was talking about me in *The Song of the Strange Ascetic*); he was fundamentally conservative while I am fundamentally liberal, but he was forthright about his views, held them honestly, and changed them when he felt it necessary.\n\nI would much rather be friends with someone like that with whom I disagree with than someone who agrees with me perfectly, but is dishonest, manipulative and closed-minded.\n\nYou don't have to agree with me, just don't try to bullshit me :)",

    "text": "Should I quit my stressful job and just temp instead? Hi. I'm at my wits end with my job- apologies for the essay. I had an interview a week ago for the most perfect job for me but to get the time off I said I had a doctors appointment in the morning. The previous afternoon the Principal (yes I work in a school) emailed saying I needed to speak to her before she could authorise my absence? She wasn't available all afternoon so I was feeling anxious all day, not knowing what to do. My line manager has been very reassuring saying it's normal behaviour here. The Principal came into my office at the end of the day and put me on the spot interrogating me about the appointment. She asked me what it was for as if it's a routine appointment she can't authorise it (?) but I said I'd been unwell at the weekend (had been off sick anyway) and that I still didn't feel right and I need to have some tests. She then asked if it was a fasting blood test and being on the spot I said yes and she continued to put words in my mouth that \"those appointments tend to be first thing so you should be back by 9:30 right?\" Me:\"Erm well last time I had to wait hours to be seen\" \"but you can turn up early to avoid that can't you?\"\nShe agreed to the morning off but then after speaking to HR came back asking me why I'd said I might not be back until 1pm? My job interview was the other side of the city at 10am and lasted 2 hours so I knew 1pm could be doable. So the interview ran over and the trains were all delayed so the earliest I could get back to work was 2:30! I decided to lie even more to my kind boss that I'd been ill at the doctors and was sick on the bus so wasn't going to make it in. I felt so guilty! She said that HR will want to see my appointment card! But I never get given an appointment card or letter unless it's something serious like a hospital appointment. I'm feeling super anxious about it now especially if I don't get this job. I'm actually thinking to hand my notice in and join an agency. I have a bit of money saved and a supportive partner but there's that risk of not finding work. I don't know what to do. An agency rang be back straight away after I submitted my cv to say they have clients always looking for my skills so I'm feeling a little more confident.\nThis Principal is a sociopath. She sacked a cleaner for taking unauthorised leave even though the cleaner gave 9 months notice and it was her step sons wedding she wanted to go to! Also she refuses people dentist appointments even if they're at the end of the day when it's quieter. I just want to get out of there. Its really stressful too 😢 Today they handed me a formal letter saying I have to meet with them to discuss my sickness absence as it's gone over their limit (they have a ridiculous HR policy) and that I might be given a written warning! Plus also I was emailed today that I have to start covering on the reception desk as they are short staffed. That job is my worst nightmare I hate anything people facing and it's a really high stress job as the parents that come into the school are abusive and sometimes violent :( plus I've always been let off other duties as my role is so busy that I can't be away from my desk.\nI still haven't heard about the interview and they were supposed to let me know 4 days ago but when I emailed them they said a decision hadn't been made yet. So there's still hope.\nI cried in the toilet at work today and then on the bus home. I feel like handing in my notice asap but I don't think it's a good idea. My boyfriend thinks I should do it the day before the meeting which will be in over a weeks time so maybe between now and then the agency or job offer will come. But also it'll mean I won't have to go through the emotional trauma of that meeting. The last time I had one they told me I need to wash my hands more if I'm getting ill all the time! I told them the stress of my job and the fact we work with over 1000 kids with constant colds is the reason why I've been ill! Plus I had flu and was signed off by my doctor but they just dismissed it. Plus yesterday I found out the head dismissed the manager of the school care takers because she didn't like him! He's a nice guy and works so hard but this woman is so evil! I just can't understand her logic. I think she just sees us as a resource and not humans with lives.\nI'm so sick of this bullying dictatorship and I'm seeing others being treated even worse than me 😢Really wanted to just walk out today and not go back.\nI should also say that this isn't what I really want to do with my life as I'm an artist and I'm getting more and more success and publicity so I know that if I worked somewhere with more flexibility and less hours like temping I could propel my practice. I just need to encouragement and to hear stories from others who may inspire me 😊",

    "text": "Job is Perfect Except For One Thing I recently got a job at a digital advertising firm. I am the content writer and I pretty much write blog posts all day for our client's blogs. \n\nI like my job, I like the tasks, and I enjoy the company of my other co-workers. I've also made friends with the staff at local businesses and eateries nearby. So far so good. \n\nBut this one girl just kind of ruins it. And what's worse is that I have to work with her directly. She just really gets under my skin. This week there were two times when I felt humiliated by her.\n\nOne of our clients is an OBGYN practice. The blog post I had to write was about questions people ask during pregnancy. One of the questions I put in was about breastfeeding. She calls me over to her desk and says, \"Yeah, I never asked my doctor this.\" Then she turns around and asks another woman, \"Did you ask your doctor about breastfeeding when you were pregnant?\" I felt so relieved because the woman said yes and that it was one of her main concerns. During that whole thing, I felt so embarrassed, I felt my face turn red. It was just so mind-boggling to me that she would question the research I did because her experience was different. \n\nThe next incident was with the same client. I had to write a blog post about pap smear FAQ's. I had 520 out of 600 words written. I asked her, \"Can you give me any ideas on how to meet the word count?\" She just goes, \"I'm not the content writer. Finish it.\" I just felt so bad because I was shot down for asking for help. \n\nThere have been other instances where I have been shot down for asking for help, gotten my ass chewed out for making a mistake due to unclear instructions, and numerous times where I have received such bad feedback and critique that it took longer than usual to turn in a better draft. Problems that should have been quick fixes and fixed in a day extended into becoming a week-long problem because communication was so poor and she couldn't get all her thoughts on one page. \n\nThis one lady quit the company last week after working there for over a year. She said that she saw no future working here if she had to work with this woman all the time. She tells me that she's worried that I won't be able to learn more about digital marketing or get experience doing other tasks such as social media management or digital advertising if I have to work directly with this woman. She would be the one teaching me how to do these tasks and honestly, I don't know if that would work out. She is very bad a communicating, crass, and rude and I just don't see myself staying here by next summer. \n\nI got this job in October and have been working here since. I really like the owner of our company and I like everything else, but having to work with this one girl is just really messing this up and it's making me depressed. I don't want to go to work if she's going to be there. \n\nAnyone else gone through something similar? How did you handle it?",

    "text": "Is It Worth it To Apply for a Job When There's History? Yeah, I know, the answer seems obvious at first glance, but this is one of those weird situations, so bare with me. This is kind of a long story, so be warned.\n\nBack in the summer of 2014, I had an internship in my field. I was ecstatic about it, but things kinda went downhill. The position was great, the people were great, but I was having some issues. Some with mental health, and some (as it later turned out) with physical health. Long story short, I had an anxiety disorder that is now in remission, exacerbated by pneumonia that I somehow contracted early on the internship, that wasn't caught until towards the end. Because I kept feeling crappy, I definitely missed days, but I was definitely present and accounted for on most days, with most of my absences towards the end. Also, none of them knew about my anxiety. Or, at the very least, I didn't tell them.\n\nThe management ended up receiving a letter from me that was essentially an apology, along with a doctor's note confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia. \n\nAlmost a year later, I run into my favorite ex-boss. We talk. She hadn't been told of the pneumonia stuff, so I filled her in on everything, including my continuation of my Master's Degree program, despite having transferred to a different school. She actually praised my decision to switch schools.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to now. I'm a month away from finishing my schooling, and a posting just went up at this same place. It's a perfect \"starter\" position, and I'd be directly reporting to my favorite ex-boss listed above. The problem is, I don't know if I should do it. With the history there, I'm frightened of even trying at this point.\n\nSo...what do you guys? Is it even worth it?\n\nEDIT: Oh, I should also mention, after I sent out the apology letter, I spoke with the woman who had coordinated the internship on the school's side. She said that they had nothing but good things to say about me. I wasn't sure if they were just being nice because of how sick I was.",

    "text": "Curious if company is misclassified as 1099 My mother works for a transportation company. They transport elderly and disabled people including those who require wheelchairs and stretchers for transport. Drivers are all required to wear khakis and either a red or white polo shirt with a company logo on it (They usually look like Target employees with a different logo on the shirt), they all drive company vans capable of holding wheelchairs and stretchers (company pays for all costs, the vehicles are not leased to the drivers), and all drivers are given an ipad to assist in navigation and payment. \n\nThere are no exact set hours because the work is based on when clients need to be somewhere like a doctor's appointment. Drivers can technically refuse to drive somewhere, but they risk incurring the wrath of the boss (franchise owner is known as boss) and losing their job, so no one does. People seem to take off of work about the same as they would with a normal job. Notice of leave is required for vacation and family matters, but there's no official minimum forewarning required.\nAll drivers fill out sheets listing what clients they drove, how the client paid, and how much the trip cost, but not how much the driver is owed. That's calculated by whoever does payroll who calculates the percentage of the trip the driver gets based on the full price of the trip listed on the driver's sheet. I think this means it can't be considered an invoice. All drivers are paid every other Friday.\n\nIt just looks to me like this company has misclassified itself as 1099 or just barely qualifies. What do you guys think? \nI thought about this before when my mother's back was injured trying to deal with a 400lbs woman in a wheelchair on a fairly steep ramp. I realized the company wouldn't be required to to help her at all and she could receive no worker's comp. It's come up again because I have agreed in the past and recently to help the company with some work when they were short handed and received a paycheck on Friday that was about $45 short. If they refuse to fix it when I go in today, I don't think I can exactly report them to the department of labor.",

This woman at HR said to e-mail her so she could e-mail his supervisor and HR know. They want to know what's going on.\n\nHow do I go about this? My boyfriend really does like this job. It's a call center tech support position.\n\nDo I go into every bit of detail of how his anxiety/depression is making it where he doesn't even want to get out of bed? He's also started a new medication which may be making it worse. Do I also put in that I tried calling his doctor on Tuesday and they wouldn't help him?

    "text": "As a girl who ended up not aborting, I am more pro-choice than ever. It is your life. Hello everyone.\n\n\nFirst of all, I would like to apologize in advance for the numerous grammar mistakes I will be making, since English is not my first language. Also, I am very tired and my head is foggy writing this with less than 3-5 hours sleep for the last 2 weeks, so there is a possibility this will be a incomprehensible mess.\n\n\nQuick back story: I am 21-years-old with a baby who is 1 year and 8 months old. I became pregnant at 19 for my then-boyfriend-ish dude. He isn't really in the picture anymore, with his whole heart. He has his own life with a new girlfriend, he studies, he parties, he goes on vacations. He has a fun and active life. That fun and active life doesn't leave that much of time for our daughter. His effort is maybe once a month, usually a lot less, reaching out to ask how she is doing, otherwise it is 99% of time me who sends the whatsapp messages (who are left unanswered) and calls (who he seems to ignore happily pretty often), trying to get him see our daughter. \n\n\nHe doesn't pay child support since he is a broke student, but most of all we had a deal of leaving third parties out of this to have his relationship with her as good as possible. In his words, he will make it up with love with what he can't pay. Obviously I am considering to break our \"deal\" since he has 0 respect to it anyway. It will be a long, exhausting fight where I will be the cruel, money-thirsty manipulating bitch, his new girlfriend will see me doing this because I want to sabotage their relationship and he will be the victim.\n\n\nAnyway, this post wasn't about my ex, I don't know why I wrote about him. Maybe because I just saw his instragram travelling photos from exotic beaches and felt a sting of jealousy and saddness. \n\n\nAs I said, I was 19 when I became pregnant. You know those girls who say \"I _always_ wanted to be a mother!\"? Yeah, I am the complete opposite of that. I can't understand that, like someone would be speaking a different language. What do you even mean with that?? How can someone dream of having children? My first instinct was to abort, immediately after I took the test. I don't like kids. I never wanted to be a mother. I never, for a second, dreamed of having kids in my life. \n\n\nMy then-boyfriend, took a strong pro-life stand, but made it clear he will respect my choice even if I abort. He didn't push or bully me to anything, let's make that clear. What he did do, though was that he did manipulate me with a rosy view how fun it will be to play with our little kiddo. In his mind it was only ponies and rainbows. I thought we will raise this kid together. He told me so, very clearly.\n\n\nI did book an abortion date. The days before that after school I spend scrolling through pro-life-websites, youtube-videos, sites (even reddit) where women like me where called a whore, why didn't I use contraception, this is my punishment, I will go to hell for this. I could spend 9-10 hours glued on my phone and fall asleep at 3-4 in the morning, since I was too anxious to sleep. My mom was the only one who was relieved that I will abort and supported me. My crazy religious relative (the nuts one in our family) who got to know about my situation and harassed me that I will \"pay for my sins\". Good stuff like that. \n\n\nI live in probably the best country in the world for women. I am _not_ religious. I have never been religious. My country's overall position to abortion is very relaxed and respectful towards the women. The conditions to keep my child as a poor (well, let's be honest, I had no income then, have no income now) woman are the best in the world. We have a fantastic welfare system, free health care, free education. Everything. I saw that a lot on those so called pro-life sites, and have seen them later on. Women who say they are feminist and want the _conditions_ to be so well women don't have to abort. I had those conditions. \n\n\nFrom that day I became pregnant (or let's say, more precisely, that first day when I started to scroll those websites) I have lost my real will to live. That kind of will that makes you dream and enjoy life. That kind of passion where you  _look forward_ to things. Where you are anxious to go to the world and fight for your place in life. Anything can happen, life is so exciting and fun. That was my life before I became pregnant. I had dreams of university, maybe a foreign husband, erasmus, travelling, partying, experiencing.  Learning languages, dancing till the morning, drinking, making friends. \n\n\nThe day before my abortion I had the worst panic attack, my first. After that there has been plenty. I cancelled my abortion the morning of it. I felt enormous relief. \n\n\nLet's be honest about the reasons here: I, a person who was raised in a very non-religious-only-namely-christian household, was convinced I am going to hell if I do this. Yes, you read that right. I would never confess this to anyone else, ever, but I did not keep this baby because I saw a future with her or because I wanted to, I did because I did not see that I could terminate it now. I felt 100% trapped, everything was over. The mistake was already happened, nothing could save me anymore. Either I was going to be a baby-killer or then I was going to have a stupid, boring life. No good options. \n\n\nI am more pro-choice today, as a mother for a very challenging but beautiful almost 2 year old, than ever. I know motherhood now. I know what my life is now when I had this child. I lost myself. I am still not in the university because I can't concentrate on reading for the entrance exam with her. I am trying this year, but it won't happen. I am exhausted. Money is tight and it is _very_ strictly controlled, even though because I live in an awesome country I am not missing anything.\n\n\nMore than anything, life is lonely. My friends are living their own life, no one is a mother. I am the boring, frumpy shell that is nothing like what I used to be. I have strecth marks, my boobs are sagging at 21, I am overweight. I had a very difficult and painful birth that still manifestates itself today in form of me having trouble of holding on farts. I don't use make up anymore, nor do I dress up since I don' have money for clothes and I hate my appearance so much there would be no point anyway. Oh I am sorry, I know that when women become mothers appearance and \"superficial stuff\" don't matter at all since we don't care about anything else than our children's welfare. If we do, it is just to please our husbands. Well, I don't have a husband, and I mourn the loss of my looks very much. It affects my self esteem.\n\n\nI am perfectly aware how society even the most feminist, free countries in the world sees single mothers. I am a fuck up, a mess up, I was \"pumped and dumped\", I deserve this. No good man wants me anymore. I have lost even the boys who used to be my friends, not to mention when my boyfriend left us absolutely no one was interested in me anymore.\n\n\nI spend my days with my little human. I take care of her, I feed her, I bathe her, I play with her, I go to the park with her, I read to her. I am constantly, absolutely constantly, scared of parenting her wrong. I try to learn about parenting methods which I can't seem to really keep up with in real life. \n\n\nNow, let's get to the important part of my mindless, long rambling: **I love her**. With all my heart. I have short times of immense joy with her. My life is for her. I am trying to get into university in a field that would have 9-16 days so I can construct my life around her.  I will fight with everything I have to ensure she has a good life. \n\n\nIf I was sent to that day right now, holding my phone with shaking hands, convinced I have to cancel my abortion, would I still do it? No. I wouldn't. I would abort. \n\n\nPeople don't like extremely complicated answers, answers that actually reflect life that is hard and has a million different view points. They want \"oh not aborting was the most wonderful decision of my life, my child gave me a reason and happiness and everything\". They don't want young women with no realistic opportunities to support themselves without the help of the government to have children, but will judge those who abort.  \n\n\nIf I could, I would go back and abort in a heart beat, actually understanding what it means to stay up alone all by yourself, be left my your boyfriend who has the freedom to just merrily fuck off to his exciting student-life bubble with our old friends. I would understand how taxing the bodily, mental and hormonal changes are. I would understand, than once you have a child _that's it_. Your life is over, or at least put on on hold, and you _never_ get life or those precious years of freedom,  fun, studying and networking back. The reason people make babies in stable marriages is because parenting is FUCKING HARD. It is FUCKING EXHAUSTING. I would give _anything_ in this world to do this when I am significantly older, with a supporting husband, living our on own money, in house. It would be wonderful to have that now, but still it wouldn't be what I really want in life. It would still be a second-place good. \n\n\nI don't need help, or reassuring, or cheering or \"it will be get better when that baby reaches age x\"-thing. Nor I am looking for compassion. I know clear well my post comes off as a selfish, whining bitch. That's how women are seen. We have a motherhood myth, and if you don't fit in you are a monster. I don't need advice or \"why don't you just adopt/quit bitching and enjoy what you have/at least you have a healthy child/most people have it worse\". I don't give a fuck. I know perfectly well I am a good mom and will be a good mom, and I will do everything for her. However I don't like it, I don't like my life. Its lost. \n\n\nI have been to the doctor and yes I am depressed. I don't need \"this is your post natal depression speaking, it will get better when you get sleep, when she is an adult you are grateful for her blah blah, you would be depressed anyway\". I don't believe depression being an illness that just pops out randomly for no reason at all. I am depressed because I hate my life and have no way out, and the reason it is because I hate being a mother. You can reverse every single thing in life except having kids and death. \n\n\n**TL;dr**: Women who are pregnant and thinking whether or not to abort: Do not give a single fuck for _any_ outside opinion. Not the opinion of your boyfriend, or even husband, relative, friend, church member, whatever (I know the husband and boyfriend-part will trigger a massive roar, don't care.) . Look at _your_ life in the future, what you want, and then act accordingly. Keep your child ONLY if you WANT TO BE A MOTHER. Everything else, finances, relationships, people shaming and guilt-tripping you, is bullshit. I am **not** encouraging anyone to abort. I am saying that in the end no one else will be there, and it will be you and only you, with your one, unique life. It needs to be _your_ decision you know you can live with the rest of your life. Those people wanting to influence you are not going to care or help you in the end. \n\n\n\nThe end. \n\n\n**Edit**: I have to go now and it can take me a long time until I get back (I can't be on phone or computer when I am with my kid) , so I am upset I can't answer to each and every post made here, but. Please know that all your positive messages have made a huge impact on me. I am in tears. I shared something painful and instead of a few trolls and ignoring, I got to have so encouraging and beautiful messages and other women sharing their feelings and life situations. I thank all of you for your PMS (except the trolls) and your messages. I will read all of them and try to answer to as much as I can.\n\n\nAnd to that person who gave me gold, I have no words. Just... Thank you. Thank you so much.\n\n\n**Quick edit 2 since this is important**: I would never say to my daughter that she wasn't really wanted,  and I will do everything I can ever to feel the complete opposite. I will never tell her anything what really happened when I considered my options. I've always said to her I loved you since the moment I knew you were coming and that she is my greatest gift, and those things are true. My daughter is the light of my life, and I don't blame her on anything, what I do blame is myself and wish that women could have more support. I know my feelings are more complex than mothers are allowed to have, but to those asking if I hate my daughter that is the last sentiment I have. I will be the best I can for her, and I am sticking to my decision.\n\n\n\n**Edit 3** : Good god I am shaking. I don't understand what is happening here. I am honestly in a state of shock. I thought I would just quickly check this before crashing since I can hardly keep my eyes open, and came back to blown up inbox of hundreds of messages, _four fucking golds_,  this is being in the r/all. I can't wrap my head around what is happening.\n\n\nYour messages. Your private messages. It would be impossible for me to try to put in words how I am feeling right now. It would be too little to say that I am overwhelmed. I have read message after message with my hand covering my mouth since I can't take all these people reaching out to me, telling their stories and sharing how they feel about their situations that are from every perspective of this issue, people sending just LOVE, just lovely, encouraging, loving messages for a complete stranger (and yes so, so many hateful trolls too, btw I don't read further immediately when I spot on a message that was mean simply to hurt). I don't know what to do with all this love. My heart is beating so fast.\n\n\nIt would be absolutely impossible for me to go through all of them right now, it is very late and I have spend much longer on this than I really could. I will read each and every single of them and reply to as many as I possibly can.\n\n\nI can't believe just letting the world see my ugly raw hopelessness and feelings of being trapped could open a gate like this. I dwell on these thoughts hour to hour, day to day alone, month to month, usually when grandma takes my daughter to her so I can have a short break I write to myself in my diary. I can't believe the amount of women reaching out and sharing how they feel. \n\n\nAs I said, I am not religious, but I believe in the universe. But let's just say I've have a _very_ hard couple of months, and _extremely_ hard couple of days, especially this day. i think. I think I was supposed to write this. Something has cracked inside of me, I can't handle my emotions right now but this, this has been more therapeutic than the 7 months I have spent with a professional. I know this sounds ridiculous, but this is some kind of turning point for me. I feel it.\n\n\n\nI don't know how to say thank you. Thank you. Just **thank. you**. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Now I am going to drink about 6 liters of water to hydrate myself after all this crying and then I think I am going to lay down to the bed and be actually able to breath without the heavy feeling of creeping pain and soul-crushing anxiety blocking it. Then I am going to sleep well. For the first time in so long I don't want to write it. I just know it. \n\n\n\nSince I have this one short chance to say how I feel about this and maybe reach out to someone (also because I received so many of those messages of how I promote and encourage abortion), I will repeat this in a shorter way: **Nothing else matters than your own, personal, deep desire and inner voice on choosing what to do. It has to be YOUR choice. Do it ONLY if it TRULY is YOUR choice. Nothing else should do, since nothing else really matters.** Everything and everyone trying to manipulate, influence, bully, shame, or convince you is indifferent. It should go without saying, but since it was confusing to so many people, this applies to those women wanting to keep your baby but feeling that you are too much of x, have too much or too less of x or are being pushed by a partner/parent/important person in your life to abort. That decision _will_ hurt you, greatly.\n\n\nLet's get through this one more time: your marital status, age, education, wealth, what the society and community thinks, your image, how religion/someone from the outside views your decision, every single one of those are not what should be the reason you do what you do. \"But women are struggling to conceive so I should feel lucky, but my married lover wants me to abort, but I have everything I need in life, I am ready\", do not give a single fuck if it goes against your inner voice. If it comes from the outside, it is not yours, and you will have more than a hard time living life that is not yours. If it is, you will find a way to cope with everything and anything that comes along the way, since nothing in life is a greater motivation, source of power than knowing what you are doing comes from you.\n\n\nAnd lastly for those attacking me for bringing up the pro-life propaganda and how much it affected me, being skeptical about how it can get through to someone like me: when you are a confused hadly-an-adult, in a situation that is so panicking you feel like you are in the roof of a burning apartment with no opportunities to save yourself, with a huge hormonal rush, not knowing what to do (or more like thinking you aren't supposed to do what you want to do), you submit to powers you would normally not pay a second to. And I consumed that shit _a lot_. I understand it is hard to understand for an outsider, but when you are in a state of complete vulnerability feeling like it is something too big for you to decide, it is easier to listen to someone who says they know exactly what is right for you even if you know it isn't. They use stuff that cuts down to your emotions and really fucks up your mind.\n\n\nI am not blaming my boyfriend, my internet habits, or anyone outside for my decision. I take full responsibility of what happened. No one forced me with a gun to do anything, even though it felt like it in some way. But just like it was my choice, I should have seen it truly is _only_ my choice and absolutely no one is invested in that I am.\n\n\nAnd that is my goal for women to realize. I belive we are strong together and should celebrate and look out for each other. Womanhood is a beautiful but hard thing and we need to help each other. Thank you, you wonderful ladies and gentlemen. I will get back to all of you soon.\n\n\nThank you for giving me hope, since that is what I got from this. Hope. So much hope. I am now going to bed with a lighter heart I've had in years.",

    "text": "Dear Fellow Pro-lifers; We can't legislate away abortion and why we shouldn't want to. Dear Fellow Prolifers,\n\nI am Pro-life. To me, that means caring not only for unborn children but also the women who feel they have no other choice than to terminate their pregnancy.\n\nThe thought of someone having an abortion tears at my heart. The loss of an innocent life physically hurts me. But this isn’t something new. Abortions have been going on since the dawn of time. We will never be able to reverse legislation that makes it legal. And we shouldn’t want to. We shouldn’t want to go back to a time when desperate women would go into an alley and let someone they didn’t know perform a dangerous procedure on them. \n\nI don’t want that and you shouldn't either. Instead, we should be doing everything possible to make it so that women aren’t forced into that position to begin with.\n\nThat starts with education. We need to support legislation that encourages sex education that teaches our young people about safe sex. Not only to prevent pregnancy but to also prevent the spread of STIs. The idea of abstinence, waiting until someone finds their one true love, is great. It’s what we want for our children. But it didn’t work a hundred years ago and it doesn’t work now. Our self-worth, as women and as people, should never be tied to our sexuality. To tell someone they are worth less because they gave in to temptation, the same temptation probably close to 100% of the adult population gave into before marriage, is disgusting. If, as a parent, it is important to you to teach that to your child, then go ahead. But I, as a Christian, am called to love everyone. Even those who don’t agree with me in my beliefs. And I certainly don’t expect others to follow commands I failed to obey. How many abortions are on our heads? How many abortions have been done because single women were too embarrassed to tell their religious families that they were pregnant outside of marriage? I never want my children to feel like they can’t come to me. I don't want them to be afraid that I would disown them or send them away should I find out they had sex outside of marriage. It’s preposterous. We need to stop holding others to a higher standard.\n\nNext, we need to fight for legislation that provides free or low-cost contraception to anyone who asks. If everyone having sex knows about contraception and can go to the pharmacy or the local clinic or their doctor’s office and get it, imagine how much it would reduce the number of abortions in this country. This includes the sixteen-year-old high school student that wants an IUD, the thirty-year-old mom that wants an implant, and the forty-year-old homeless man in need of condoms. And I am including the morning after pill in this, because that is NOT an abortion, and people need to stop acting like it is. All the morning after pill does is makes the uterus inhospitable so that the fertilized egg doesn’t attach. I would rather this than have a woman wait six weeks to find out she’s pregnant and then have an abortion. \n\nWe need to stand together, whether pro-life or pro-choice and find our common ground. We need to fight so that abortion is so rare that it’s no longer a division between us. We are women, we are strong, and we can do this!",

    "text": "Does anyone else feel like you weren't aware how incredibly hard pregnancy and labour can be to your body? Hi ladies,\n\nI have been thinking for a while about something that has crossed my mind quite often- how many times while enduring the pain from recovering from my catastrophic labour I felt like I was \"tricked\" to have children, which I know isn't true but I felt that before I actually got pregnant, nowhere was I told how destructive labor can be and that pregnancy can be 9 months in hell, not a beautiful thing. Just, why we don't talk about it? I guess what really bothers me was how horribly uneducated I was about pregnancy and labour- and this comes from an university educated woman who lives in a first world country with top education.\n\n\nNo one- absolutely _no one_ told me before my pregnancy that my birth could end up being a diabolic experience with fourth degree tears (I don't know if I translated that correctly, sorry, English isn't my native language), my flesh being cut from anus to vaginal hole, that we would need the assistance of a vacuum. That I could end up having multiple surgeries trying to give back my ability to hold my feces, that it would take **14 months** for to be able to have sex with my husband again and even after that the sex would never be the same. I have suffered from horrible PPD and the feeling that my sex life and body had been robbed from me made me really angry, sad and bitter for a long time. My marriage has suffered from the fact that I couldn't have intimate connection with my husband. The worst part is that even my super patient husband made me feel that I was being selfish or that it was my choice at some points- even thought he knew perfectly well what had happened and had talked to all my doctors. My husband's best friend made a tasteless joke about our lack of sex while he was drunk, one that made clear how he and obviously my husband thought that he was the victim on that situation and I was to blame.\n\n\nI know having a birth as bad I did is very rare, but we do exist. I am not an unicorn, I meet other mums of young children at park every day and all the subjects we discuss are something I would have never known before. How so many ladies (even with minor tears) can have problems holding pee, how common it is to have at least some tearing, how hard it can be to start sex life after labour, how everything your body from your breast to fucking _feet size_ can change shape, how nobody prepared how nauseous you can feel through the pregnancy,   how your belly can look a bowl of oatmeal 3 years after giving birth to your third child, how breastfeeding can be painful and hard instead of being a beautiful bonding experience... The worst one is definitely one of my best friend's whose birth was so excruciating torture she went into psychosis (again, extremely rare but she was never even discussed about the possibility, even though she had a heavy risk factor from her mother's side). Fortunately she recovered because she received immediate professional care and is a wonderful and dedicated mother, but she still refuses to talk about it even with me. It is that shameful and horrible to her.\n\n\nI quite often feel like we don't discuss the possible side effects of something that is so common not nearly enough- most of the stories in mainstream media are raving about mothers who looked like they could walk for Victorias Secret two hours after giving birth, we don't really see how pregnancy and labour can change drastically the bodies even of those mother who take care of themselves, and how it is normal to have a different body afterwards. And that is only about looks, not to mention real life stories about what labour and pregnany can really be about.\n\n\nShould we start educating children on school about what labor and pregnancy can do to your health and body, what is your opinion? Do they already do that in your country?\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that I felt ashamed and that I was wrong if I talked about what I've been through, because that would come as if I am not grateful for having a healthy child and we just have these expectations as a society than once you've had kids nothing else but kids matter and \"sacrifices\" are something all moms are willing happily to pay. I found a support group for women who experienced a traumatic birth and we all there expect two have had bad tearing, so that is why I said we are not unicorns- since if I am a \"statistic exception\" (fourth degree tears are rare, but more than 90% of women get some level of tearing from vaginal birth, I was told) I know quite damn lot of us exceptions. We have discussed a lot about the grief from losing your sexuality and sexual pleasure. Myself I am grateful for still having a working clitoris (for those who don't know, yes you can tear even your clitoris during birth) and it is basically my only source of pleasure, but I don't feel anything else. I have had surgery, I've physiotherapy, I have done pelvic rehab therapy and worked those muscles like a fucking maniac, but it hasn't helped and I've started slowly to accept it never will. Because that is the only thing even doctors say, that it will heal with time. Well guess what, I discussed with one woman who grieves about the loss of sense after her childbirth and who was also told it will come back with time... I guess she isn't holding her breath anymore considering her daughter turned 24 this year.\n\n\nI just think it would've been good to be aware that this can be the price to pay for having children, so I could've done my decision fully aware of them. \n\n\n**second edit**: I can see I struck a nerve with this post. I don't know if it is somehow organized, but I am getting flooded with nasty pms. Pretty great deal of assholes in this thread too. Wonderfully most of people are great and the brilliant conversation in this comment section makes it worth it. I am grateful for this community. ❤️\n\n\nAnyway, so many people are making the exact same comment thatI had to put this up here: for the people saying \"they do tell you this when you are pregnant\", YES they do. They indeed do, the flood gates open once you announce you will have a child. Then it is too late. That was kinda the point of my post. Before that nobody shared a peep with me, even when we told we were trying for a baby. And for those kind souls pointing out google exist, I never found these consequences like losing the ability to control my bowel movements and losing my sex life even with googling. \n\n\n\nI try to reply as many of possible (however I am on a clumsy new mobile abd having to do other things at the same time, so I will type slowly as a grandma and there will be a lot of bad English. Still, for all the ladies sharing, please know I read and like each one of your post), and I appreciate the (civilized) discussion and sharing stories.  It is relieving to see I an clearly not alone, even though I know it. But still. Was somewhat nervous posting this because, well, it is my life. That is maybe why those pm s got me in such a bad mood.",

    "text": "A cranky hospitalist's top 100 pet peeves in inpatient medicine Feeling a little crispy after 6 straight weeks on inpatient wards, I decided to share my top 100 pet peeves, almost all of which came up during this month and a half. Feel free to agree or disagree, or to add your own.\n\n(For the record, I certainly don’t claim to deliver perfect patient care, and have been guilty of committing more than a few of these myself!  Categorization into fields isn’t meant to imply that specialists in each field are the primary culprits.)\n\n\n\n**Cardiology**\n\n* Admitting a patient for “r/o MI”, and not mentioning their ECG in the admission H&P (bonus annoyance points for instead documenting “ECG: NSR”).\n\n* Reflexively checking BID electrolytes in every patient on diuretics (sometimes appropriate, but often not necessary)\n\n* Reflexively repleting every patient’s K>4 and Mg>2. (How did this practice become ubiquitous?)\n\n* Reflexively checking a troponin in response to a brief episode of asymptomatic NSVT (bonus annoyance points if the ordering doc doesn’t bother with a follow-up troponin)\n\n* CT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or emergency med docs who cannot reliably interpret an ECG.\n\n* Fluid restricting patients with heart failure exacerbations. (it’s sodium restriction that’s helpful)\n\n* Placing a patient on two hemodynamic drugs simultaneously which have directly antagonizing effects. (e.g. midodrine and hydralazine, dopamine and metoprolol, etc…)\n\n* Describing a patient as “preload-dependent” because of [aortic stenosis/pulmonary hypertension/ diastolic dysfunction/etc…] (all patients are preload-dependent!)\n\n* Micromanaging the blood pressure in a patient with no other cardiovascular disease (e.g. orders for prn hydralazine for SBP>160).\n\n* Continuing statins in hospice patients.\n\n* Placing a patient on a low fat “cardiac diet” because of a history of CAD. (hospital food is already bad tasting enough!)\n\n* Assuming a patient with an irregular pulse has a-fib without checking an ECG.\n\n* Stating that a patient can’t have tamponade because he/she isn’t hypotensive.\n\n\n\n**Pulmonology**\n\n* Admitting a patient for pneumonia, and not mentioning the CXR in the admission H&P.\n\n* Admitting a patient for any pulmonary complaint, and relying on the formal interpretation of the CXR without even looking at it oneself.\n\n* Assuming that a patient with a chronic cough and strong smoking history must have COPD.\n\n* Diagnosing pneumonia based solely on CXR findings, irrespective of the presence or absence of consistent symptoms/signs/lab tests.\n\n* Stating that a patient can’t have a PE because he/she isn’t hypoxemic.\n\n\n\n**Critical Care**\n\n* “Renal dose dopamine” (yes, our hospital still has docs who insist on this!)\n\n* Using the heart rate as a primary indicator of volume status.\n\n* Reflexively giving Lasix to every patient with pulmonary edema.\n\n* When there is no room for your sick medicine patient to move to the ICU because the CT surgeons refuse to transfer out their post-op CABG patients who have been stable for days.\n\n* When your patient codes, and no one gets around to informing you until hours later.\n\n\n\n**Renal/Fluids**\n\n* When a patient with mild hyperkalemia and no ECG changes is given the full smorgasbord of hyperkalemia treatment - calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb, albuterol, and tons and tons of kayexalate. (bonus annoyance points if no one even checked for ECG changes before ordering all of that)\n\n* Conflation of “prerenal AKI” with dehydration. (AKI from heart failure is “prerenal” too!)\n\n* Not checking a UA in patients with AKI.\n\n* Giving sodium bicarb for a moderate metabolic acidosis.\n\n* Reporting the results of a UA as “dirty”.\n\n* Placing a patient on overnight IVF when they are NPO from midnight for a procedure scheduled for 8am.\n\n\n\n**GI**\n\n* Ordering a stool guauic for a patient whose stool is visibly bloody or melenic. (bonus annoyance points if the intern is only checking it because the GI fellow insisted).\n\n* Ordering a PPI for a soft reason, which will likely be continued for years before another doctor reexamines whether it’s appropriate.\n\n\n\n**Endocrine**\n\n* Placing an insulin-dependent diabetic on only a sliding scale.\n\n* Continuing qid finger sticks for weeks in chronic patients whose diabetes is controlled well enough to never require insulin.\n\n* Deciding against the use of metformin in a patient solely because his/her creatinine is 1.6 - and above a traditional, arbitrary, and evidence-free cutoff of 1.5. (bonus annoyance points if the doc actually wants to prescribe it, but the pharmacist declines to approve the order.)\n\n* Checking TSHs in critically ill patients (exception: the very rare patients whose critical illness could be predominantly due to thyroid disease)\n\n* Seeing a diabetic food tray full of non-diabetic-friendly food. (bonus annoyance points if it includes an Oreo brownie)\n\n\n\n**Rheum**\n\n* Confirming or refuting a diagnosis of gout in a patient with a hot, swollen joint using a serum uric acid level instead of arthrocentesis.\n\n* Ordering 25 different autoantibodies in a patient presenting with a vague, multisystem disease “just to be sure it’s not autoimmune”. (bonus annoyance points if a 1:40 ANA then prompts a formal rheum consult)\n\n\n\n**Hematology/Oncology**\n\n* When an oncologist declines to consult on a patient with suspected malignancy until the malignancy is confirmed via pathology.\n\n* When a proceduralist/surgeon requires a patient’s INR to be below some low and arbitrary threshold prior to a procedure (bonus annoyance points when they express no interest in the patient’s bleeding history – a much better predictor of bleeding risk).\n\n* Reflexively transfusing at an arbitrary hemoglobin, irrespective of symptoms or other medical problems.\n\n* Using a higher-than-normal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion simply because a patient has a history of CAD. (it’s *active* ischemia that should be a reason to transfuse to higher Hb goals)\n\n* Diuresing an anemic patient for the primary purpose of hemoconcentration.\n\n\n\n**ID**\n\n* Daily ESRs or CRPs\n\n* Feeling obligated to switch to PO antibiotics for 1 day prior to discharge, to make sure the patient’s infection doesn’t worsen due to narrowed coverage or poor absorption. (It will take longer than a day for the infection to worsen to a point that you’ll be able to observe.)\n\n* Insistence on always using the same temperature cutoff as constituting a “fever”, and reacting to every “fever” in the same way. (i.e. sending blood cultures on every patient whose temp is >=101.0, and on no patients whose temp is <101.0)\n\n* Being excessively dogmatic with antibiotic courses in situations of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. a patient with known Staph bacteremia who is estimated to have a ~10% chance of endocarditis must be treated with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics because endocarditis wasn’t “ruled out”).\n\n* When infection control won’t let us take a patient off respiratory isolation for TB until they have been formally ruled out, despite the order having been placed accidentally. (yes, this really happened!)\n\n\n\n**Pain management**\n\n* Dosing narcotics less frequently than their duration of action. (i.e. oxycodone bid)\n\n* Ordering acetaminophen as the only prn pain med in a patient whose chief complaint is pain.\n\n* Refusing to give narcotics to an inpatient with a history of substance abuse, irrespective of how severe their acute pain is.\n\n\n\n**Neuro**\n\n* Documenting a patient’s neuro exam as “non-focal”. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was a neurologic symptom)\n\n* Not assessing the gait of a patient on admission. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was “weakness” or “falls”)\n\n* The use of a stethoscope head as a reflex hammer.\n\n* Reflexively ordering a vitamin B12, TSH, and RPR in every patient presenting with altered mental status.\n\n* When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)\n\n* Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.\n\n\n\n**Psych**\n\n* Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)\n\n* Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.\n\n\n\n**Orthopedics**\n\n* When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.\n\n\n\n**Urology**\n\n* When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)\n\n\n\n**Emergency Medicine**\n\n* When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.\n\n* When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.\n\n* When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. \n\n* When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.\n\n\n\n**Radiology**\n\n* When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.\n\n* When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.\n\n* When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.\n\n* When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).\n\n\n\n**Communication/Charting**\n\n* Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&P without any indication as to how that decision was made.\n\n* When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.\n\n* When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.\n\n* When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.\n\n* Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)\n\n* Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “*your* father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)\n\n* Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.\n\n* When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.\n\n* Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)\n\n* Documenting an assessment in an H&P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.\n\n* Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)\n\n* When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.\n\n* When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.\n\n* When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.\n\n* Stating “the patient *failed* such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)\n\n* Stating “the patient *refused* their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient *declined* their 3am lab draw”.)\n\n* Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”. (This is one word choice on the wards that does actually seems trivial.)\n\n* When a doc talks disparagingly about NAs, RNs, NPs, and/or PAs as an entire profession.\n\n* When a non-doc talks disparagingly about docs as an entire profession (bonus annoyance points if it’s an NP wearing a “heart of a nurse, brain of a doctor” shirt)\n\n\n\n**General**\n\n* Referring to professional society guidelines as if they were laws that must be followed.\n\n* Lean\n\n* Referring to patients as “customers”. (bonus annoyance points if it’s during a daily huddle to discuss lean management techniques)\n\n* When someone cancels a lab order and doesn’t inform the ordering doc. (bonus annoyance points if it’s a phlebotomist who felt that a delirious, semi-comatose patient “refused” the blood draw)\n\n* When an outside hospital transfers a patient and fails to include a discharge summary. (bonus annoyance points if they include 100+ pages of nursing notes)\n\n* Attempting to discharge a patient without first assessing how the patient is going to get home.\n\n* Citing a study in a progress note that doesn’t actually support whatever point the writer was implying it supported.\n\n* Failing to question an unexpected, bizarre lab value as possibly being “bad data”. (“Sure, I suppose this person recovering from a hip fracture, whose sodium yesterday was normal, could have a sodium of 90 today, but maybe we should recheck it first before starting the 3% saline…”)\n\n* When a PMD insists that the patient they are trying to directly admit to a particular medicine ward is appropriate for that level of care, despite the doc never having stepped foot on the ward in question.\n\n* Making a medical decision primarily based on metrics or patient satisfaction ratings.\n\n* Failing to adequately incorporate a patient’s personal preferences and social situation in crafting a treatment plan.\n\n* When one runs to the coffee shop to make it just before closing, only to find that they decided to close 5 minutes early.",

I have changed certain presentations and details to maintain relative anonymity. I wanted to share this narrative to let people see my perspective as a new EM intern. It is long, so please- feel free to ignore it.*\n\nAll the best,\n\n-wtffng\n\nI arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.\n\nA nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.\n\nHe’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.\n\nMy shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.\n\nA life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.\n\nAn older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.\n\n“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”\n\nThe nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.\n\nThe patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called.\n\nI walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:\n\n“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.”\n\nThere are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.”\n\nWe’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.\n\nI haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing.\n\nI push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure.\n\nThe patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right?\n\nAs I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.\n\n“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient.\n\nSo here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name.\n\n“Hello, I’m WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.”\n\nThe patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause.\n\nI do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time.\n\nI pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend.\n\nI tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”\n\nI laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.”\n\nI smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn.\n\nI am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.\n\nThere’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.”\nShe stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.\n\nThese damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit.\n\nI step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.\n\nI don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this.\n\nI sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-\n\n“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.\n\n“What?” I respond confusedly.\n\n“Trauma to Bay 4.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.”\n\nIt clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time.\n\nThe rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later.\n\nEach time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me.\n\nI can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shift ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes.\n\nTwo senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom.\n\n“So how’d it go?”\n\nI explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations.\nThey laugh.\n\n“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.”\n\nThey pause and one asks “So what did you think?”\n\nI sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.\n\n“It was awesome. I made the right choice.”\n\nThey laugh.\n\n“wtf, Welcome to Emergency Medicine.”",

Every person I meet who asks me what I studied in undergrad or what I do currently cannot seem to grasp that I am going to be a doctor. Every single time I tell someone I was pre-med and I'm applying to med school, the response is always some variation of \"oh, to be a nurse right?\" \"oh, so you mean you're going to nursing school.\" It makes me so mad!! If I was going to nursing school I would've said nursing school, not medical school. I feel like they're correcting me. This happens in bars, in ubers, at the hair salon, at work (pretty much every small talk interaction). And to top it off, when I explain that I am not going to be a nurse, but a doctor, I typically get some sort of laughter and mocking/teasing reaction along the lines of \"oh you must be real smart then right\". My male colleague has been asked by strangers if he is a doctor when he is walking through public wearing scrubs. Meanwhile, I literally tell people I'm going to be a doctor and they still can't understand how I'm not a nursing student. \n\nIs this the norm for other women in medicine? Does this ever change in medical school or the workplace? I want to hear other stories and know what to expect. Also any advice on how to firmly respond to certain comments would be nice too.",

    "text": "Fellow outpatient FP and IM providers, what tasks do you delegate to your staff? I recently came close to a nervous breakdown at work, because I was just so tired of working so hard, but seeing the mountain of work in front of me only grow, and facing a daily onslaught of patients and fellow employees annoyed at me for things undone. Our office manager (an experienced nurse and very people-smart woman) had a serious chat with me, and it came to her attention that I'm personally handling a lot of nuts-and-bolts tasks on my job that all the other providers at my practice delegate to nursing or clerical staff:\n\n* routine med renewals by e-script\n* prior authorizations\n* paperwork for durable medical equipment\n* legal forms\n* calling patients about normal labs and imaging\n* researching what the submitter of an unusual or unprecedented form for me to fill out wants exactly from me\n* checking if routine screening or monitoring labs are up to date\n\nI'm a highly self-reliant person, who's been faulted many times for \"trying to do it all\", long before I got into medicine. I don't easily trust people to do things for me and I have a hard time accepting favors. I try very hard not to be a borrower or a buck passer -- when a task is put in front of me, my knee jerk reaction is to just take it on myself and ask nobody for help. Less charitable people have described me as \"a control freak\" or \"not a team player\". I never scored well on Systems-Based Practice, and I'll readily admit that managing human resources is not a talent of mine.\n\nResidency did a piss poor job teaching me what nuts and bolts tasks of outpatient medical practice ought to be farmed out to supporting staff, versus done by the doctor. I was expected to do everything, both as a way to learn how the healthcare system works, and part of the (despicable, IMHO) boot camp culture of \"I can always do more\". Whenever I would ask my attendings, no matter how un-whining-ly, how much more I had to do or whether or not something was my responsibility or someone else's, I'd invariably get rebuked for even daring to ask, for breaking the polite fiction that residents are always happy to do more. So you could say I was conditioned not to delegate, but to put nose to grindstone and just do it.\n\nIt all makes sense now. For my first year as an attending, I've been taking on far too much. All of the items in my bullet list above are tasks my practice *would prefer* I farm out to support staff. Doesn't help that nobody ever told me this, nor that my nurse (medical assistant, actually) is brand spanking new too.\n\nHelp me out here, fellow Medditors. Imbue me with a sense of \"what's appropriate to delegate\" that I've never had.",

    "text": "Just a \"thank you.\" I just wanted to say thank you to all of you wonderful nurses. I truly feel like it takes a special individual to get into the nursing profession. \n\nWhen I had my first baby, I was induced. I was a scared new mom, unsure of how everything was going to play out that day. I had the best nurse. I will never forget her. She worked 7am to 7pm. She told me at 6:45 that my doctor was going to call a c-section. I bawled. She told me she wasn't going anywhere. That sweet lady stayed with me through my operation, cleaned vomit off my chest when the anesthesia made me sick, held my hand, explained everything that was going on, and took pictures of my new family of three. She left at 8:30 that night after getting me settled into my postpartum room. I could not believe that this woman cared so much about my emotional well-being to sacrifice her time. Just writing this makes me tear up.\n\n\nI recently had a my third baby. I had a high-ish risk pregnancy (GD) and was monitored twice a week during my last two months of pregnancy. I was treated with the utmost dignity and respect. The nurses would always ask if there was anything they could do for me. When I would say \"no thank you, I'm okay.\" they would say \"let me just refill your water for you.\" Or \"would you like a warm blanket?\" They were always going above and beyond. Bless the CNA that helped me go to the restroom the first time after my surgery. What a shit show that debacle is.\n\nAbout 48 hours after delivery, I started feeling my hormones crash and the \"baby blues\" set in. My husband left to go take our older children to school and I just sat in my bed crying. When the nursery nurse came in, she looked concerned and asked if I was okay. I told her that this was my normal, that my body just freaks out day 2 or 3 from the hormones. She wiped my tears away and sat and talked to me for a good while. \n\nI know she was busy. I know you all are busy. You're over-worked and I'm sure you feel under appreciated. Please just know that lots of patients DO remember your good deeds and appreciate those little touches that you bring to patient care. You are making a huge difference in many people's lives. So thank you. Thank you for all you do, no matter how big or small.",

    "text": "Looking for support I resigned from my job yesterday. Put in 3 weeks notice, but until my last day, I really need some emotional support from fellow teachers who have been in the same boat. I signed onto my job thinking I landed The perfect job my principal had promised me a salary of around $47,000 a year. However the salary ended up being much much less. I first saw this when I read through my contract. However I know I didn’t sign into teaching for the money so I kept the job anyway. In one of the first meetings I had with my principal he promised me that everything was already set for me. I wouldn’t have to reinvent the wheel all of the curriculum was in place and I would simply have to teach it and get adjusted to my first year of teaching. He also told me that their school was known for having an excellent mentoring program for new teachers. All of these were empty promises. One of the first promises broken was the curriculum. I was told that the curriculum was in a format that I could find online so I researched it. When I looked at the curriculum map, it was the most vague and on organized pathetic excuse for curriculum guide that I have ever seen. I teach high school English and one of the objectives was just “reading has been pushed to a high level.”  that’s just one of the many vague terms on there. Mainly it just has common core objectives listed and alongside with the different books that they’re supposed to read in class. No specific essays listed no specifics summative assessments and no specific overall goals. So basically I have no idea what I’m doing. So being a new person my first stop was teachers pay teachers. I have probably spent over $300 in just lesson plan material because of the lack of preparation that I was given. Believe me I do have a new teacher mentor and I did confront her with this issue. She told me “oh I don’t think the old guy who you replaced knew how to fill out the curriculum guide. “And that was her excuse. Since she didn’t offer to help me, I thought that I would ask for some help among the entire department at our next department meeting. Upon entering that meeting I had made a list of questions to ask because I was unsure and I needed to get help from somewhere. One of the first questions I asked was “does anybody happen to have some really good MLA formatting materials that I could borrow?” Immediately another coworker, let’s call her Jan for lack of confusion, snaps at me “well what do you need MLA formatting materials for? “ I explained to her that I had developed this project where students would conduct research over a different forms of mythology and I didn’t even get to finish the word mythology before she interrupted me and said “they already did that in middle school!” I tried to rephrase what I was about to say and correct myself in stating that it wasn’t Greek mythology but rather modern day forms of myths and legends and yet again she interrupted me and snapped “well I’m already doing that in my class then!” I replied “Well, could we all meet to go over my curriculum guide because I am confused as to what I can and cannot teach. “ their response to me was that they would plan a day when we could do this, only there only free day was nearly a month from that day. I left that meeting feeling very lost, confused, alone, and unsupported. on top of all of this, I am also involved in extracurricular activities. So meanwhile while I am just trying to not lose my sanity in figuring out what I’m doing every day, I somehow am supposed to manage all of this and the extracurricular activities that I sponsor. I would try and ask for help whenever I could during my lunch hour to other teachers, but Jan yet again would cut me off and berate me in front of everyone. When I tried talking to my mentor about this problem, she stated “that’s just how Jan is.” So then I started to eat lunch in my room. So now, I have no friends at the school in fact I have a woman that attacked me every time I have to ask for help and I have no idea what I’m doing with no support from anyone. I came home from school almost every day sobbing to my parents. As I drove home from work, I contemplated suicide. One day, I woke up and I couldn’t breathe. It felt like there was a whole inside of my chest. I decided to take the day off and the panic attack lasted almost all day until finally I took a sleeping pill and try to go back to bed. The next day, I try to force myself to go to school. I was standing in front of the entire class teaching when I felt little droplets of sweat forming on my four head. I went and calmly sat down at my desk and the students continue to work on an assignment I given them. During my prep time I went to the bathroom and I got sick. I told my secretary and she let me go home for the rest the day. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep. In 3 days, I was only able to force down half of a granola bar. That day I went to my doctor and she told me I was definitely developing an anxiety disorder and having severe depression. She told me it sounded like I was so overwhelmed that I might be developing a stomach ulcer. She told me if you have a job that is making you physically ill and mentally ill due to a laundry list of aspects then get out because that is a toxic environment. This really resonated with me and I got put on anxiety medication. She gave me a doctors note so that I could take the weekend to decide what I was going to do. That weekend after crying for what seemed like hours on end and not eating for three days I decided that I was going to resign. I would give them three weeks notice and I would be very professional about it but I just couldn’t live this way anymore. The stress and toxic environment was literally tearing me apart from the inside out. This might all sound dramatic, and you might just think that I’m a quitter or someone who is weak and couldn’t handle teaching. But I needed to learn that my mental health comes first and that I don’t have to push through with something that makes me miserable every day just because it seems like that’s what’s the right thing to do. I learn to put myself first, and I learned that I am in control of my own life and my own happiness. I’m glad that I no longer have to see suicide as my only option. I just need to get through these next three weeks and then I can finally be free. I don’t know if I’m officially done with teaching, but for right now I definitely need some space from it in order to value it again because I feel like my dream has been murdered by a shitty school. Right now, I just really need some support from others who have been in a similar situation. \n\nTLDR: Everything about my job was toxic so I resigned and now I’m looking for support.",

    "text": "Teenage Crisis: What should I do with my life? Hey, guys! I'll try to get to the point, as I hate when others drag on in their writing.\nSo, I'm a 16 yo kid, I'm poor (single parent, low wages) and a minority (although I pass as an American). I used to be one of the really smart kids when I was little (winning awards and stuff) but that's changed over the years. I'm a little less active in school, I feel less smart, find it hard to get motivated and am mostly depressed all the time.\nThat said, I am excited for college. I have a scholarship set up already (basically I get to go to uni for free). I'm excited for uni for several reasons: mostly because I look forward to being free of the hindrances of living with my mom (an elderly, sick woman who I love, but who makes me feel old, too, sometimes) but also because I want to FINALLY be myself and pursue my interests. My aunt (a doctor) tells me I should become a doctor too. She thinks if I work hard enough and get off my ass and pursue the dream, I can achieve it. Other people have straight-up told me I'm dumb and lazy and irresponsible and would make an awful doctor. I've been thinking about healthcare, business, law/politics and construction/agriculture mainly as fields I'm interested in.\nFacts about me\nSmarts: 3.8 gpa, mostly A student (and that's when I'm lazy) but I still feel like I'm dumb, probably because I hate myself. I'm a procrastinator, and that makes me hate myself most of the time and I don't know how to stop.\nPros: I'm artistic, creative, good with my hands, imaginative and good at analyzing literature & interpreting stuff, helping others, reading (i love reading) writing, expressing my thoughts, and -sometimes- teaching.\nCons: I'm lazy (trying to be better, though), depressed, slightly erratic, spontaneous, self-belittling, introverted.\nThings I like: Art, Literature Science (even tho I love it, I suck at it sometimes), History, Politics, Social Sciences, Psychology, Health Science\nThings I suck at/would probably suck at: Math, Physics, Engineering, Finances\nI'm torn between wanting to stay here and pursue a cheaper education which probably guarantees more money and moving out in the future OR leaving as soon as I have my bachelor's degree and studying while working & living on my own. I really, really want to live on my own as I HATE my current living situation. But I'm also open to staying, especially if it means a better situation with work in the future.\nWhat do you think?

    "text": "My wife was charged with assault today. And forcible confinement. I put up with the abuse for around 5 years.  She has provoked me into physically defending myself more than once andd it paralyzed me with fear that she could convince the authorities that I was the aggressor.  \n\nThings of course escalated over time, being undealt with.  She started threatening to call the cops\n\nWhat broke the camels back is over mothers day weekend she started drinking and called our daughter an \"attention whore\" within earshot.  Our daughter is 4 and my angel, my pride and joy.  I told her to go fuck herself and went to the shed, then a few minutes later went in to grab a beer and then go sit outside to cool off.  She went ballistic that I took another beer and ended up pushing me and biting me with our daughter in my arms.  \n\nI went to the hospital earlier today to have them look at a bite mark she left on me and to report the incident.  The FEMALE doctor said \"that's assault you know,  you should consider contacting the police. My husband is an officer\".   I ask her - wouldn't be just be my word against hers?  She says \"No, I've seen it and the police will take pictures.  The police will make a judgement call.\"   I then went to the police and showed them the bite and that she was blocking me from leaving the house and ended up shoving and biting me.  \n\nLong story short guys - Don't hesitate to contact the police if you have been assaulted.  Even if you've just been FORCIBLY CONFINED, contact the police.  It is illegal to block someone in a room and not let them leave.  This evokes your right to physically defend yourself, meaning you have the right to push them out of the door to get out, within reason.  You can't purposefully cause injury but you most certain can push them back out of the way and even restrain them if they start assaulting you for trying to escape.  Assault simply means pushing, shoving, body-blocking, etc.  Anything a man would never get away with towards a woman really does apply to us also.   YOU MUST CONTACT THE POLICE FIRST.  The female doctor said I should before the situation gets redirected back on me - because if your abuser contacts the police first because they feel you are about to report them,  you could very well be the one in handcuffs instead of them. \n\nedit: a word",

    "text": "Feminists oppose men's sexual freedom This web site is named the Campaign Against Sex Robots, but its title should be the Campaign Against Men's Sexual Freedom.  Companies like Real Doll have for years sold realistic looking sex dolls for men (and some women) who want an alternative to the real thing.  They're essentially high-end sex toys.  Now Real Doll, and several other companies, are at work creating sex robots, which will essentially be animated versions of the silicon sex dolls.  They're not for everyone.  Some people will find that strange, but for some people it may be the only sex or companionship they can get.  Other people who have sex lives might want such a toy to enhance their sex lives.  Maybe a guy has a girlfriend and has always fantasized about a threesome.  A sex robot could provide that without the risk of including another actual person.  The bottom line is if a sexual activity does not force any person to do anything against their will, then it's their business and no one else's.  \n\nHowever, the Campaign Against Sex Robots opposes a man's right to make such a choice, even though his doing so hurts no one else.  They make absurd arguments against sex robots.  They claim that the use of sex robots will turn men into rapists.  It's the same old tired refrain we keep getting from feminist hate groups: Everything is rape.  It's not clear from their arguments if they think that using a sex robot will cause a man to go out and rape a real woman or if they think the robot is getting raped.  First of all, women have used dildoes for decades and they've never caused a woman to go out and rape any man, woman, or child.  Sex robots, as high-end sexual enhancers, will not cause men to do that either.  And it's not possible to rape a robot.  The robot is not a sentient being any more than a dildo is.  \n\nThe truth is that feminists simply hate male heterosexuality.  They've bitched for years over what is totally involuntary about male sexuality: That men prefer young and beautiful women.  That's just the way evolution has made human biology.  You could not change that any more than you could change the rings of Saturn.  You'll have about as much success changing that as religion fanatics have converting gays to being straight.  The irony is religion fanatics are hostile toward male homosexuality while feminists are hostile toward male heterosexuality.  \n\nFeminists hate men who go out socializing trying to find a girlfriend.  Supposedly, it's sexist or feeling “entitled to sex” to look for a girlfriend and ask for a woman's phone number.  \n\nFeminists hate men who don't have a girlfriend.  If you decide “fuck it, it's not worth it” and pursue your own life's goals sans female companionship, you're branded a loser.  \n\nFeminists hate men who pay for sexual services.  Pay your hard-earned money for the services of a prostitute and somehow you're exploiting women, even if it's in a Nevada brothel where all the professionals there do their trade willingly.  \n\nNow feminists are adding a new thing to hate men for.  If you don't do any of the above and instead buy a sex robot, something that hurts no one else and doesn't infringe upon anyone else's rights, they hate you for that.  \n\nThe only thing they won't hate you for is for being a man who has a six-figure income, looks like a model, and works as a doctor.  That's probably something like .004% of the male population.  The other 99 plus percentage of men are worthy of feminist scorn.  \n\nI never wanted to have to fight against feminists, but I will.  They're out to oppress male sexual freedom.  If you want to go MGTOW and just have sex with realistic robots, that should be your choice.  If you want to hire sexual services, that should be your choice.  If you want to stay in the game and search for a girlfriend, that should be your choice.  In all of these, as long as you don't force anyone to do anything against their will, it should be no problem.  However, feminists have a problem with you being anything other than a drop-dead model gorgeous dude who earns 500K as a doctor (or some other glamorous profession).  \n\nShoeonhead has made a great video mocking the hatred of feminists over sex robots: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nOsdj8dmc",

    "text": "I will not remain silent: A recount of my first molestation. Well, it happened. It was bound to in light of the overwhelming statistics. In fact, I’ve been an outlier for the past 12 years (every 2 minutes an American is sexually assaulted) but on a Friday night, by a friend of a friend, when we were all supposed to be having fun, I was forcibly grabbed from behind (at least twice), while en route to the next bar. He shoved his hand roughly down my stomach to my groin (thankfully over my pants), and fondled my chest while grinding against my back. On the street. In front of hundreds. \n\nI did nothing. \n\nNo pushing him away, no attempts to escape, and not a word of protest. I did not want to cause a scene. I did not want him to call me a cunt, or bitch, or any other of the slew of insults thrown at women for not accepting unwanted attention. I did not want to rock the boat. So, I made my way to the next bar, squirming out of his continued attempts as best I could without being overtly aggressive. Once we made it past the bouncer (another opportunity to ask for help missed), I told him that I needed to “go to the bathroom,” and that I would “be right back.”\n\nI did not go to the bathroom. Nor did I come back. Instead, I escaped through the back door like a burglar, looking sheepishly away from the bus boy who was throwing a bag of rubbish into the over-sized dumpster. I ran through the crowd, from whom I asked no help, and of whom no one stepped forward to ask if everything was okay. I made it to my car, nervously looking about to ensure that he hadn’t somehow realized what I was doing and followed me out, got in, closed the door, and wept. Like a fucking baby.\n\nI am a second-degree black belt. I’ve traveled the world, got my juris doctorate, and bought my own house. I am a grown-ass woman, and was crying like a goddamned baby. Not because I was scared, or felt violated; but because I was so ashamed of myself. I had every opportunity to say something to him; to anyone else. I had every opportunity to run away. I had every opportunity to punch him in the fucking throat. But I didn’t. I was not confident enough—not in my training (you don’t need to be trained in martial arts to gouge someone’s eyes out)—but in my own self-worth. \n\nI did not respect myself enough to speak up when I was being treated as a brainless, soulless piece of ass. I did not think I deserved to bother strangers with my problems. \n\nBut, you know what?\n\nI do deserve to bother people when I’m being attacked. \n\nI do deserve to push misogynistic, soft-skinned, weak-minded, negging, entitled, prissy, fuckface pieces of utter garbage away when they overstep their bounds. \n\nI deserve to be angry. \n\nI won’t press charges for what was absolutely egregious statutory  misdemeanor battery, because I don’t want to spend any more time or energy on a waste of space, resources and oxygen. But, what I am going to do, is rehearse. Practice. Look at my face in the mirror every day and tell it that it’s fucking awesome, and that it—along with the rest of my body—deserves respect. I’m going to rehearse exactly what I’ll do and say to anyone else who thinks they can touch me without my say so. I’m going to practice evasive actions and self-defense tactics.\n\nSo, the next time I go out to dance, and wear sexy clothing, and drink—because I fucking can, and won’t let asshats dictate what I do on my limited and precious time to myself—I will not be passive, sending mind messages to people around me, silently pleading for help. I will not remain silent. \n\nI. Will. Not. Be. Ashamed. \n\n**Update**\nI mustered the courage to report the incident to the local police department. The report was filed for informational purposes only, which means that it will not go to the state attorney for consideration for prosecution (and likely would not have been chosen as a candidate anyone due to the lack of known witnesses). \n\nHowever, now fuckface's name is in the system so that next time he tries his shenanigans and they are reported, there will be a record to help the next victim bring his pathetic ass to court. \n\nIt was also highly empowering to be able to follow though on my promise to myself not to be silent. Of note, the officer who took my statement  was amazing. She listened to my story, prompting me for details as gently as she could; and when she saw the emails he sent me the morning after, which asked \"how dare I leave him,\" she correctly noted his worth as a human. It was not high.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential. Suddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing.\n\nThese career-based changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate. Without the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "Fixation on nuclear families at the expense of moms? I posted something https://redd.it/6silnk that made me think about how fixated US culture is on nuclear families. I have a number of friends who are Arab and Asian and I started asking them about the family structures in their cultures, particularly around birth and child rearing. All of them said that it's a given that a new mother will have a ton of support from parents, aunts, and cousins and this continues really throughout childhood, with families helping it seems like a lot more than they do here. The woman moving into her parents' house is pretty common after birth too.\n\nIn the US it seems like there is a strong belief that your family is first and foremost your spouse, then kids, then any other relatives, but it's based around the spouse. Even if your spouse has only known you for a year they're still number 1. And asking for help from family is seen as stunted or immature.\n\nI encountered this recently when I listed my mom as my emergency contact and the doctor's assistant was like why would you not put your spouse? Well because my mom is close by, retired and more likely to be able to actually respond to phone calls, and as close to me as my spouse is!\n\nWhy is that? It seems like we have such high rates of postpartum depression and stressed out mothers, yet maybe we've tossed aside something that makes it a lot easier for everyone.",

    "text": "Just quit my job after my manager's year long campaign to ruin my life. Feel so free! Using a throwaway for this. About a year ago I got transferred to the head office of a well known company. It was a major promotion and I was really excited. In the interview I noticed that my boss (let's call her Kim) seemed to dislike me but I brushed it off as paranoia. Turns out I was right; a favourite of Kim's had been promised the position but I wound up getting selected.\n\nFor a year Kim made my job hell, she deliberately waits until the day reports are due to assign them to me, does not include me in meetings or departmental training. She stands in the door of her office and makes fun of me with other coworkers and female managers- my clothes, my appearance, my voice.These are the minor incidents.\n\nSomeone in the department was stealing money and cell phones - this has been going on for years. Imagine my shock when Kim comes up to my cubicle with security in tow demanding that they search my things. They go through my desk, drawers, bag everything. One of the guards is asked to search me physically but refuses. Of course they didn't find anything. I was the only person searched.\n\nI decide to keep my mouth shut and keep my head down. Doesn't work, in my interim evaluation Kim tells me, I'm an egotistical bitch and she's going to destroy me. She's grinning the whole time and then hands me a write up slip. It says 'Blubirdz has exhibited an attitude problem on multiple occasions and when warned was visibly upset and made her manager uncomfortable'. I don't sign off on it but it goes on my file.\n\nAfter this I'm written up weekly by Kim and other senior members of staff for various infractions.e.g. being one minute late, lying about having the flu and forging a sick note, displaying an attitude (this one was a gem - I wasn't even in office on the date used), not being a team player and not reminding someone to write me up officially.\n\nThen comes the kicker, I'm called into a meeting with her where she tells me although my work is exemplary, I'm being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan for my attitude problem; I'm distant, cold, quiet. Part of the Plan is that she's referred me to the company therapist to seek help for my mental problems. I'm stunned. She just keeps grinning. \n\nI wrote my resignation letter and turned it into HR. My previous manager called to see what's going on and I told her everything. I don't know what she did but I had an HR meeting and was given a formal apology and will be granted extra severance pay.\n\nThe joke about all of this - the same woman who wanted my job got it - no interview, nothing. And Kim had the nerve to ask me to plan and complete my tasks for the rest of the year. I refused; I'm going to train this woman and finish up what I need to before my month's notice is up.\n\nThanks for listening everyone! If you ever get a bad feeling about a workplace follow your gut.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the support you guys; really means a lot! I did try to report my boss when this first started but was told to toughen up and support her in her role. A lot of this stuff happened in the open. It really hurts when people see you being targeted and either join in or turn away. For the record, I don't have mental health issues.\nI don't have a job lined up yet but I'm going to use this notice period to look for one. Not being kind by staying - I need the money, I take care of my gran and I'll probably have to get rid of her home nurse :(",

    "text": "I feel incredibly proud of the fact that I proposed to my fiancé and that he proud and unashamed to tell everyone in our lives. After years of friendship and almost a year of being together and actually dating, I was pretty much 100% sure I wanted to marry my boyfriend. So much so that I started to search for dresses and day dream about where the venue would be.\n\nThen as I was walking to my car to go home from work, I told myself to stop thinking about any of that stuff until he proposed...then I thought, why the fuck can't I propose. I know he loves me. I know I love him. I want to marry him. Why am I going to wait until he does it? A tradition neither of us cares about? \n\nSo I started the surprisingly annoying and difficult hunt for a male engagement ring. I set up a date for us, and I proposed to him. \n\nAnd then I made myself subconsciously aware that even though he accepted my proposal, he'd probably be a little embarrassed that a woman proposed to him and that he wouldn't necessarily want everyone to know. We could just let them assume he asked me...but then, as always, he reminds me (partly) why I wanted to marry him in the first place.\n\nAllover Facebook and instagram he was posting his ring and how happy he was and surprised he was that I proposed. \n\nHe's so funny, too. I had to work Sunday night and he told me he had to leave to run an errand a bit before I left for work. I show up to work and he's sitting at the nurses station showing off the ring and drinking coffee with my coworkers. \n\nLadies, if you love him and you want to marry him, there's literally no reason why you shouldn't feel empowered to take the initiative and ask *him* to marry *you*.",

    "text": "If I see another girl on my news feed bash Planned Parenthood... ISTG This post is dedicated to my many IGNORANT Facebook \"friends\" that think Planned Parenthood is just a \"baby killing\" clinic.\n\nA year ago, I was in a situation where I was hospitalized. I had an ovarian cyst rupture and was in extreme pain. Like, the worst pain I've ever been in.\n\nI had to have a magnitude of tests done, to determine the cause of my pain at first. Transvaginal ultrasound, a pelvic exam...etc\n\nI remember one of my nurses asking me when the last time I saw a GYN was. I kind of chuckled. I giggled and then told her that I couldn't afford health insurance and that I couldn't remember the last time I had a GYN appointment. She didn't giggle back.\nShe told me about the importance of getting regular GYN checkups, and how women my age are particularly at risk for cervical cancer. She then told me that at 28 years old, she was diagnosed with stage 4 cervical cancer. I hadn't had a pap smear done in years, keep in mind.\n\nI was no longer giggling. \nWhen I left the hospital, armed with referral papers of local gynecologists, I was determined to find one and get an appointment made ASAP. \nYou see, my doctor told me that even though they were able to do multiple tests, to determine the cause of why I was in the ER, they were legally prohibited from doing a pap smear. I was told that my cervix was extremely irritated and it was imperative that I get a pap smear done.\nSo I went home and started calling around.\n\nAt first, I started calling local GYN clincs close to me, for convenience purposes. Then, I started googling any GYN clinics I could find. You know what all of them had in common? They were fully booked and couldn't see me for the next 6 months.\n6 months. That was more than enough time for the cervical cancer I was worried I might have, to spread and end my life.\nI was in a panic at this point. The hospital said they weren't \"allowed\" to do a pap smear on me, but urged me to take action, but every single GYN clinic in a 30 mile radius was booked.\n\nAfter calling about roughly 45 clinics, I was extremely frustrated and felt helpless. Out of curiosity, I had asked couple of clinics what the pricing would be to be seen and have a pap smear/breast exam done. I was looking at around $200 out of pocket.\nI googled Planned Parenthood and saw they performed a plethora of female services, including breast exams, pelvic exams, pap smears, std screenings.....etc.\n\nI called the nearest Planned Parenthood and asked when the soonest I could get a pap smear was. They asked if I was available that weekend. I immediately accepted and hung up the phone.\nI had called nearly 45 private practices, with zero luck, and here Planned Parenthood was, able to see me in less than 5 days. \nThe woman oh the phone was extremely patient and helpful, she listened to my explanation of why I needed to be seen, she informed me that if I didn't have health insurance, that they would see me regardless and charge me a small percentage of whatever I could afford, based off of my income.\n\nI went to my appointment that weekend. The staff was extremely professional and informative. The clinic was clean and well taken care of. My doctor took her time with me, answered any questions I had, and made me feel very comfortable. I never felt like I was being treated less important because of my low income status. \nA week or so later, I got a phone call with the test results - I was completely fine. No cervical cancer - yay!\n\nBut what if? What if the results were positive? What if Planned Parenthood didn't exist and I waited 6 months to be seen? I can tell you right now, the chance of me being able to sit here and write this post today, could have been very slim.\n\nTHIS EXPERIENCE IS WHY PLANNED PARENTHOOD IS ABSOLUTELY VITAL TO OUR NATION.\n\nPlanned Parenthood provides services for MANY women that can't afford health insurance.\nPlanned Parenthood also spends almost half of it's funding, to prevent the spread of STD's.\n\nSo let me ask you this. You want a bunch of women in our nation to be unable to get checked for chlamydia or HIV? How would you feel if your mother or sister were unable to get their yearly checkup for cervical/ovarian cancer screenings?\n\nDo your research BEFORE you post some ignorant, uneducated comment on social media about Planned Parenthood.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "A cranky hospitalist's top 100 pet peeves in inpatient medicine Feeling a little crispy after 6 straight weeks on inpatient wards, I decided to share my top 100 pet peeves, almost all of which came up during this month and a half. Feel free to agree or disagree, or to add your own.\n\n(For the record, I certainly don’t claim to deliver perfect patient care, and have been guilty of committing more than a few of these myself!  Categorization into fields isn’t meant to imply that specialists in each field are the primary culprits.)\n\n\n\n**Cardiology**\n\n* Admitting a patient for “r/o MI”, and not mentioning their ECG in the admission H&P (bonus annoyance points for instead documenting “ECG: NSR”).\n\n* Reflexively checking BID electrolytes in every patient on diuretics (sometimes appropriate, but often not necessary)\n\n* Reflexively repleting every patient’s K>4 and Mg>2. (How did this practice become ubiquitous?)\n\n* Reflexively checking a troponin in response to a brief episode of asymptomatic NSVT (bonus annoyance points if the ordering doc doesn’t bother with a follow-up troponin)\n\n* CT surgeons, anesthesiologists, or emergency med docs who cannot reliably interpret an ECG.\n\n* Fluid restricting patients with heart failure exacerbations. (it’s sodium restriction that’s helpful)\n\n* Placing a patient on two hemodynamic drugs simultaneously which have directly antagonizing effects. (e.g. midodrine and hydralazine, dopamine and metoprolol, etc…)\n\n* Describing a patient as “preload-dependent” because of [aortic stenosis/pulmonary hypertension/ diastolic dysfunction/etc…] (all patients are preload-dependent!)\n\n* Micromanaging the blood pressure in a patient with no other cardiovascular disease (e.g. orders for prn hydralazine for SBP>160).\n\n* Continuing statins in hospice patients.\n\n* Placing a patient on a low fat “cardiac diet” because of a history of CAD. (hospital food is already bad tasting enough!)\n\n* Assuming a patient with an irregular pulse has a-fib without checking an ECG.\n\n* Stating that a patient can’t have tamponade because he/she isn’t hypotensive.\n\n\n\n**Pulmonology**\n\n* Admitting a patient for pneumonia, and not mentioning the CXR in the admission H&P.\n\n* Admitting a patient for any pulmonary complaint, and relying on the formal interpretation of the CXR without even looking at it oneself.\n\n* Assuming that a patient with a chronic cough and strong smoking history must have COPD.\n\n* Diagnosing pneumonia based solely on CXR findings, irrespective of the presence or absence of consistent symptoms/signs/lab tests.\n\n* Stating that a patient can’t have a PE because he/she isn’t hypoxemic.\n\n\n\n**Critical Care**\n\n* “Renal dose dopamine” (yes, our hospital still has docs who insist on this!)\n\n* Using the heart rate as a primary indicator of volume status.\n\n* Reflexively giving Lasix to every patient with pulmonary edema.\n\n* When there is no room for your sick medicine patient to move to the ICU because the CT surgeons refuse to transfer out their post-op CABG patients who have been stable for days.\n\n* When your patient codes, and no one gets around to informing you until hours later.\n\n\n\n**Renal/Fluids**\n\n* When a patient with mild hyperkalemia and no ECG changes is given the full smorgasbord of hyperkalemia treatment - calcium, insulin + glucose, bicarb, albuterol, and tons and tons of kayexalate. (bonus annoyance points if no one even checked for ECG changes before ordering all of that)\n\n* Conflation of “prerenal AKI” with dehydration. (AKI from heart failure is “prerenal” too!)\n\n* Not checking a UA in patients with AKI.\n\n* Giving sodium bicarb for a moderate metabolic acidosis.\n\n* Reporting the results of a UA as “dirty”.\n\n* Placing a patient on overnight IVF when they are NPO from midnight for a procedure scheduled for 8am.\n\n\n\n**GI**\n\n* Ordering a stool guauic for a patient whose stool is visibly bloody or melenic. (bonus annoyance points if the intern is only checking it because the GI fellow insisted).\n\n* Ordering a PPI for a soft reason, which will likely be continued for years before another doctor reexamines whether it’s appropriate.\n\n\n\n**Endocrine**\n\n* Placing an insulin-dependent diabetic on only a sliding scale.\n\n* Continuing qid finger sticks for weeks in chronic patients whose diabetes is controlled well enough to never require insulin.\n\n* Deciding against the use of metformin in a patient solely because his/her creatinine is 1.6 - and above a traditional, arbitrary, and evidence-free cutoff of 1.5. (bonus annoyance points if the doc actually wants to prescribe it, but the pharmacist declines to approve the order.)\n\n* Checking TSHs in critically ill patients (exception: the very rare patients whose critical illness could be predominantly due to thyroid disease)\n\n* Seeing a diabetic food tray full of non-diabetic-friendly food. (bonus annoyance points if it includes an Oreo brownie)\n\n\n\n**Rheum**\n\n* Confirming or refuting a diagnosis of gout in a patient with a hot, swollen joint using a serum uric acid level instead of arthrocentesis.\n\n* Ordering 25 different autoantibodies in a patient presenting with a vague, multisystem disease “just to be sure it’s not autoimmune”. (bonus annoyance points if a 1:40 ANA then prompts a formal rheum consult)\n\n\n\n**Hematology/Oncology**\n\n* When an oncologist declines to consult on a patient with suspected malignancy until the malignancy is confirmed via pathology.\n\n* When a proceduralist/surgeon requires a patient’s INR to be below some low and arbitrary threshold prior to a procedure (bonus annoyance points when they express no interest in the patient’s bleeding history – a much better predictor of bleeding risk).\n\n* Reflexively transfusing at an arbitrary hemoglobin, irrespective of symptoms or other medical problems.\n\n* Using a higher-than-normal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion simply because a patient has a history of CAD. (it’s *active* ischemia that should be a reason to transfuse to higher Hb goals)\n\n* Diuresing an anemic patient for the primary purpose of hemoconcentration.\n\n\n\n**ID**\n\n* Daily ESRs or CRPs\n\n* Feeling obligated to switch to PO antibiotics for 1 day prior to discharge, to make sure the patient’s infection doesn’t worsen due to narrowed coverage or poor absorption. (It will take longer than a day for the infection to worsen to a point that you’ll be able to observe.)\n\n* Insistence on always using the same temperature cutoff as constituting a “fever”, and reacting to every “fever” in the same way. (i.e. sending blood cultures on every patient whose temp is >=101.0, and on no patients whose temp is <101.0)\n\n* Being excessively dogmatic with antibiotic courses in situations of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g. a patient with known Staph bacteremia who is estimated to have a ~10% chance of endocarditis must be treated with 6 weeks of IV antibiotics because endocarditis wasn’t “ruled out”).\n\n* When infection control won’t let us take a patient off respiratory isolation for TB until they have been formally ruled out, despite the order having been placed accidentally. (yes, this really happened!)\n\n\n\n**Pain management**\n\n* Dosing narcotics less frequently than their duration of action. (i.e. oxycodone bid)\n\n* Ordering acetaminophen as the only prn pain med in a patient whose chief complaint is pain.\n\n* Refusing to give narcotics to an inpatient with a history of substance abuse, irrespective of how severe their acute pain is.\n\n\n\n**Neuro**\n\n* Documenting a patient’s neuro exam as “non-focal”. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was a neurologic symptom)\n\n* Not assessing the gait of a patient on admission. (bonus annoyance points if the reason for admission was “weakness” or “falls”)\n\n* The use of a stethoscope head as a reflex hammer.\n\n* Reflexively ordering a vitamin B12, TSH, and RPR in every patient presenting with altered mental status.\n\n* When the reason for a patient’s admission and/or their documented chief complaint is “altered mental status” without any further description (e.g. excessive drowsiness, agitation, hallucinations, disorientation, etc…)\n\n* Reporting the results of a head CT as “negative”.\n\n\n\n**Psych**\n\n* Calling a psych consult on a medicine inpatient with stable depression. (bonus annoyance points if the patient will be discharged within a day and already has a close relationship with an outpatient psychiatrist)\n\n* Overreliance on antipsychotics for delirium before first attempting non-pharmacologic strategies.\n\n\n\n**Orthopedics**\n\n* When a ortho resident attempts to turf an admission to medicine because the patient is “too medically complex”, despite the fact that the ortho service is comanaged by a dedicated hospitalist 24/7.\n\n\n\n**Urology**\n\n* When a medicine resident calls a urology resident for help placing a urinary catheter that the nurses couldn’t place, and the urologist requests that the medicine residents try to place it first. (bonus annoyance points when the urologist then becomes irate when informed that the med resident subsequently caused urethral trauma)\n\n\n\n**Emergency Medicine**\n\n* When the ED calls to admit a patient for “r/o chest pain” without first getting an ECG.\n\n* When the ED gives antibiotics without first acquiring relevant cultures.\n\n* When the ED tells the only family member who can provide critical collateral information that they can go home before the admitting doc has had a chance to speak with them. \n\n* When a medicine R2 debates with a ED attending of 25 years’ experience about the need for a patient to be admitted without consideration of their unequal years of experience.\n\n\n\n**Radiology**\n\n* When a radiologist determines whether a patient with impaired renal function can receive contrast for either CT or MRI based only on the serum creatinine, without considering age, muscle mass, comorbid conditions, indication for scan, or the availability of reasonable alternatives to the scan.\n\n* When the interpreting radiologist for a scan doesn’t address the stated indication for the scan within the interpretation.\n\n* When the primary team orders a radiology study and doesn’t include an accurate indication in the request.\n\n* When a radiologist won’t approve a seasoned hospitalist’s request for an MRI brain until a neurology R2 concurs (bonus annoyance points if it’s July).\n\n\n\n**Communication/Charting**\n\n* Charting “Code Status: DNR/DNI” in an admission H&P without any indication as to how that decision was made.\n\n* When a consultant stops seeing a patient without communicating that they are signing off.\n\n* When a consultant conveys to an intern on the primary team that they feel really strongly about a particular course of action, but then don’t speak with the hospitalist directly, and don’t convey the strength of that recommendation in the chart.\n\n* When a consultant conveys to a patient that they will/will not be discharged that day, without first discussing it with the primary team.\n\n* Referring to a family member as “the wife” or “the son”. (it’s his/her wife, his/her son)\n\n* Referring to the patient as “Mr.” or “Mrs.” so-and-so when speaking to a family member. (much better to say “*your* father/mother/brother/sister/etc…”)\n\n* Ignoring the nurse during walk rounds, despite he/she standing right there at the bedside.\n\n* When housestaff signout to the on-call team and spend 30 seconds on each of 10 patients, rather than handing over a list of 9 patients, and spending 5 minutes discussing the one patient who is particularly sick/complicated.\n\n* Documenting a chief complaint that consists of a laundry list of 15 unrelated medical problems (“Ms. Smith is a 60 year old woman with a past history significant for hypertension, smoking, homelessness, osteoarthritis, CKD, COPD, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer s/p mastectomy and chemo, DVT in 2010, onychomycosis, and chronic low grade transaminitis, now presenting with LLE cellulitis”)\n\n* Documenting an assessment in an H&P that’s word-for-word identical to its chief complaint.\n\n* Failing to look at the reason for presentation as documented by the ED triage nurse (it’s amazing how often the ED triage nurse, ED doc, and admitting medicine resident’s chief complaints are inconsistent)\n\n* When the med list in the discharge instructions, med list in the discharge summary, and the official outpatient medication list in the EMR all disagree.\n\n* When the respiratory rate of every patient on the ward is documented as either 18 or 20.\n\n* When I/Os are fastidiously recorded on patients for whom it’s irrelevant, and patients with renal failure are recorded as having “bathroom privileges”.\n\n* Stating “the patient *failed* such-and-such chemo regimen”. (Patients don’t fail chemo regimens; it’s the chemo regimens that fail patients)\n\n* Stating “the patient *refused* their 3am lab draw”. (Better to say “the patient *declined* their 3am lab draw”.)\n\n* Getting worked up over the difference between “historian” and “informant”.

    "text": "The Other Side: An EM Intern’s First Shift. *Preface: I shared this with /r/medicalschool and I wanted to share it here with /r/medicine as well. I have changed certain presentations and details to maintain relative anonymity. I wanted to share this narrative to let people see my perspective as a new EM intern. It is long, so please- feel free to ignore it.*\n\nAll the best,\n\n-wtffng\n\nI arrive 30 minutes early to find my ID badge won’t unlock the double wide magnetically guarded doors to the ED. It’s the morning shift, so someone should be close behind me- therefore, I pull out my phone, furrow my eyebrows, and completely pretend to be doing something important.\n\nA nurse walks by briskly and successfully swipes through the door with me stealthily following behind her. I walk to the resident workroom to find my key doesn’t work there either. A PGY-3 spies me fumbling and with a laugh pulls the door wide open.\n\nHe’s smiling. He’s excited for us to be starting. It’s genuine. He runs me through some basic charting requirements that haven’t been covered in 2+ weeks of HR classes and orientation, which at this point have all blurred together, interwoven between each night’s social adventures.\n\nMy shift begins at 07:00, and at 6:45 there’s a loud page “TRAUMA ACTIVATION, ROOM 4.” A grinning attending appears from nowhere, introduces herself- and instructs me to go to the trauma bay.\n\nA life threatening gun shot wound is arriving via ambulance and we’re tying our gowns down. The room is calm, but swelling with people and heat- everyone mutually understanding that this will most likely be futile.\n\nAn older nurse peers around the room, trying to ascertain who to eliminate.\n\n“WHOEVER’S NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED, LEAVE NOW,” she instructs, likely insinuating me. Several people scurry out the doors and I turn to leave, finding myself facing another attending who firmly says: “Stay here.”\n\nThe nurse starts circulating, instructing people she doesn’t recognize to leave. I’m fully gowned with a mask, but I know this won't protect me. As she nears, I turn to the trauma cart and pretend that I’m seeking some device which will be useful in the near future. She passes and I turn back, an escapee.\n\nThe patient is rolled in and movement starts. Intubation, CPR - but within minutes it is determined that yes, this is most certainly futile, and the patient's time of death is called.\n\nI walk back to my ED section to receive sign-outs. The attending looks up warmly:\n\n“Welcome to the Emergency Department, Dr. Wtffng.”\n\nThere are three Interns, one PA, and one Attending. The attending looks around and wonders aloud “Do we have no senior here? No? Looks like a busy day.”\n\nWe’ve been informed that as interns our expectation for these first shifts are simply this: Do an HPI. Learn the system. Be honest.\n\nI haven’t done an EM shift in 2 years now, and my excitement is tempered by the growing realization that after 8+ years of education, I might know nothing.\n\nI push back against this thinking and set to work as the clock strikes 07:00. I look up at the patient board and see red rapidly disappearing as the team logins to the EHR. I scan the list and pick up the first one I see- a seizure.\n\nThe patient’s from out of town, no history available. No worries, I’ve done seizure work-ups plenty of times in the past, right?\n\nAs I walk towards the room the nurse pulls back the curtain and exits.\n\n“Hi! I’m WTF, the intern working with you today for the first time here.” We exchange formalities and he is kind. He’s patient. I ask him to let me know if he needs anything and what he thinks about the patient.\n\nSo here it goes. The first patient seen with an MD straggling along behind my name.\n\n“Hello, I’m WTF FNG, call me WTF. I’m the resident doctor taking care of you this morning.”\n\nThe patient is younger. Engaged. Smart. Here for work and he certainly knows more about seizures than I do. He informs me he’s got important things to do, and he hasn’t slept well the last couple nights and had a couple drinks the previous- likely the cause.\n\nI do an HPI and order labs. I’m trying to contact an outpatient neurologist in some far away state who I soon realize doesn’t want to respond to pages sent from East Coast Time.\n\nI pick up another patient, dizziness. I whisk into the room to find a pleasant older woman who is here only because her son was concerned. She’s got important things to do, and wants to escape this place to her cabin for the weekend.\n\nI tidy up things for my first patient and discharge him. He looks at me says “Hey- Thank you, that was really quick and thorough.”\n\nI laugh and respond “Hey I appreciate that. Don’t tell anyone on your way out- but it’s my first day as a doctor.”\n\nI smile, shake his hand and leave before I can see if his face drops into disappointment. I exit the room to find the nurse standing there, obviously overhearing this statement, with an expression somewhere between amusement and scorn.\n\nI am admitting the woman with dizziness and break the news that she likely won’t be making it to her cabin this weekend. There’s soft pushback. I explain that if she were my mother I’d want her to stay in the hospital for further evaluation, and I would.\n\nThere’s a small pause and I blurt out “if you want, you can call me Dr. WTF FNG, RUINER OF WEEKENDS. I propose a weekend of awful hospital food and cable TV rather than a relaxing weekend at the cabin.”\nShe stares at me for a moment, and begins to laugh. She agrees to stay. I exit the room again to find the nurse holding onto an expression somewhere between concern and breaking laughter.\n\nThese damn curtains. I speak loudly and everyone can hear my weak passes at wit.\n\nI step backwards onto a small neurologist who has somehow snuck behind me. He does not feel that another patient of mine warrants a neurological consult but he’s already here in the ED and he’s trapped. Success. A tap on my shoulder saves me from the debate and I set to fix one of the many problems I’ve created from bumbling through the EHR.\n\nI don’t know how to document properly for billing, admit correctly for admissions, and discharge sufficiently to get the patient out. The PA is a saint. Seriously. Every question is answered patiently, from phone numbers to drug dosing. My attending, also up for canonization- is juggling every patient in the section while teaching three interns. The nurses are supportive, and graceful as they inform me of each small misstep and how to fix it. I can tell I'm slowing them down, but they're as understanding as over-worked nurses can afford to be, and I'm damn appreciative of this.\n\nI sit and try to catch up on non-existent notes and again my shoulder is tapped as I’m halfway through a sent-\n\n“That’s you.” The nurse informs me.\n\n“What?” I respond confusedly.\n\n“Trauma to Bay 4.”\n\n“What?”\n\n“You. That’s you. Go to Trauma Bay 4.”\n\nIt clicks. Those overhead pages now address me at this time.\n\nThe rest of my shift blows by, fueled by pretzels and coffee. I see the sick and ill alongside the worried well. I witness the aftermath of tragedy that will surface darkly in the newspaper days later.\n\nEach time I sit to chart, my phone rings or my shoulder is tapped. I incorrectly place and fix orders. I am slow. I feel I know nothing. Things that went so fast as a medical student take longer now, and are so much more complex. There was no magic click or growth following the MD that was placed behind my name a month ago. I am still just me, with the same knowledge base. As I work I realize the auditioning medical students likely, or perhaps certainly- know more than me.\n\nI can feel hard in my gut that I don’t have a flow, nor method to manage the tasks constantly flooding me. My shift ends and I melt into a chair in the resident workroom to catch up on my mangled notes.\n\nTwo senior residents slide into the room and flop down on the couch. They are on an off-service rotation and enjoying the periodic downtime and freedom.\n\n“So how’d it go?”\n\nI explain my concerns about flow and knowledge, pace and expectations.\nThey laugh.\n\n“It comes with time. You guys are doing great, seriously. It’s a whole new approach and we all do it a little differently. In a couple months you’ll be managing all of this and more with ease.”\n\nThey pause and one asks “So what did you think?”\n\nI sit for a second and scan my hazy memory of the past 9 hours. For a moment my gut relaxes.\n\n“It was awesome. I made the right choice.”\n\nThey laugh.\n\n“wtf, Welcome to Emergency Medicine.”",

    "text": "Women who are doctors: What are your experiences with sexism in the workplace and medical school? Does it ever get better? I'm a woman and I'm applying to medical school right now. Every person I meet who asks me what I studied in undergrad or what I do currently cannot seem to grasp that I am going to be a doctor. Every single time I tell someone I was pre-med and I'm applying to med school, the response is always some variation of \"oh, to be a nurse right?\" \"oh, so you mean you're going to nursing school.\" It makes me so mad!! If I was going to nursing school I would've said nursing school, not medical school. I feel like they're correcting me. This happens in bars, in ubers, at the hair salon, at work (pretty much every small talk interaction). And to top it off, when I explain that I am not going to be a nurse, but a doctor, I typically get some sort of laughter and mocking/teasing reaction along the lines of \"oh you must be real smart then right\". My male colleague has been asked by strangers if he is a doctor when he is walking through public wearing scrubs. Meanwhile, I literally tell people I'm going to be a doctor and they still can't understand how I'm not a nursing student. \n\nIs this the norm for other women in medicine? Does this ever change in medical school or the workplace? I want to hear other stories and know what to expect. Also any advice on how to firmly respond to certain comments would be nice too.",

    "text": "Fellow outpatient FP and IM providers, what tasks do you delegate to your staff? I recently came close to a nervous breakdown at work, because I was just so tired of working so hard, but seeing the mountain of work in front of me only grow, and facing a daily onslaught of patients and fellow employees annoyed at me for things undone. Our office manager (an experienced nurse and very people-smart woman) had a serious chat with me, and it came to her attention that I'm personally handling a lot of nuts-and-bolts tasks on my job that all the other providers at my practice delegate to nursing or clerical staff:\n\n* routine med renewals by e-script\n* prior authorizations\n* paperwork for durable medical equipment\n* legal forms\n* calling patients about normal labs and imaging\n* researching what the submitter of an unusual or unprecedented form for me to fill out wants exactly from me\n* checking if routine screening or monitoring labs are up to date\n\nI'm a highly self-reliant person, who's been faulted many times for \"trying to do it all\", long before I got into medicine. I don't easily trust people to do things for me and I have a hard time accepting favors. I try very hard not to be a borrower or a buck passer -- when a task is put in front of me, my knee jerk reaction is to just take it on myself and ask nobody for help. Less charitable people have described me as \"a control freak\" or \"not a team player\". I never scored well on Systems-Based Practice, and I'll readily admit that managing human resources is not a talent of mine.\n\nResidency did a piss poor job teaching me what nuts and bolts tasks of outpatient medical practice ought to be farmed out to supporting staff, versus done by the doctor. I was expected to do everything, both as a way to learn how the healthcare system works, and part of the (despicable, IMHO) boot camp culture of \"I can always do more\". Whenever I would ask my attendings, no matter how un-whining-ly, how much more I had to do or whether or not something was my responsibility or someone else's, I'd invariably get rebuked for even daring to ask, for breaking the polite fiction that residents are always happy to do more. So you could say I was conditioned not to delegate, but to put nose to grindstone and just do it.\n\nIt all makes sense now. For my first year as an attending, I've been taking on far too much. All of the items in my bullet list above are tasks my practice *would prefer* I farm out to support staff. Doesn't help that nobody ever told me this, nor that my nurse (medical assistant, actually) is brand spanking new too.\n\nHelp me out here, fellow Medditors. Imbue me with a sense of \"what's appropriate to delegate\" that I've never had.",

    "text": "Would a career in nursing, accounting or computer science suit me better? Hi r/careerguidance,\n\nI'm 26 and graduated with a BA in Geography and Environmental Studies in 2014. I've been struggling with a lack of direction and general indecisiveness ever since. \n\nI currently am a consultant at an oil and gas company doing \n a mixture of HSE / document control / admin type work. The lack of stability is making me extremely unhappy. I find myself wishing I had an established career like my friends who are teachers, social workers, nurses, etc. (I know I shouldn't compare myself but this is easier said than done). I'm constantly worried about being 55 and working entry-level retail for minimum wage due to my lack of concrete skills and poor choice of a degree. \n\nI think I've narrowed my choices down to three careers, but am having a difficult time deciding on which one would be the best fit. I've narrowed down my core values in a career to:\n\n1. Stability\n2. In demand (how nice it would be to not have to send 100's of resumes out and hear nothing back)\n3. ~$60,000 or >\n4. Not *extremely* stressful  \n\nI've put together a simplified list of pros and cons (based on my personality, requirements and geographical location) for each position below:\n\n**NURSING**\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* Helping people\n\n* Interest in biology, diseases, etc.\n* Entry level pay: ~$34/hr ($68,000)\n* In demand\n* Can move anywhere and can find job\n* Stability (unionized)\n* Flexibility (can work part time, casual, etc.)\n* Many different subfields within nursing\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Constantly being around people (introvert)\n* Poop\n* Stressful (some positions)\n* Potentially 4 years of schooling; accelerated programs very competitive\n\n\n**ACCOUNTING**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Working independently (to an extent)\n* Entry level pay: ~50,000/yr\n* Once CPA, in demand\n* Stability\n\n*Cons*\n\n* monotonous\n* sitting all day\n* Entry level positions over saturated\n* Stress\n* 3ish years to get BBA + CPA courses\n\n\n**PROGRAMMER / COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Working independently (to an extent)\n* Entry level pay: varies (~50,000?)\n* In demand\n* Enjoy coding and making websites\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Sitting all day\n* Being a woman in a male dominated industry\n* Advanced math..

    "text": "We need to have a serious and frank conversation about sexism in this sub. I am appalled by the level of sexism that is prevalent in this subreddit. Most notably, two top threads today [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rorr1/my_friend_and_i_had_too_different_interviews_how/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rlijr/software_development_how_would_you_behave_with_a/), kept reinforcing the notion that oftentimes, when a woman gets a job at a tech company, it's often got it due to their gender. Seriously, you all should be ashamed of yourselves. All of these unsubstantiated allegations from anonymous people are being upvoted and giving women in tech a bad name. \n\nWomen in tech have it insanely hard. Imagine being the only dude in a nursing program and you can see what these women are going through. Additionally, imagine if all of your accomplishments were ridiculed by everyone because \"you only got this job/promotion/project/etc. cause you're a girl.\" That would really suck and would totally destroy your confidence. \n\nTBH, for me, the women I know in tech are some of the best engineers I've ever met. I know that this is anecdotal, but the women on my team are entrusted with the largest and most important projects. They regularly deliver outstanding results and they are critical to the success of our (very large and very important) product at a Big 4. There are only three of them on our team of 20, but without them, our team and our product would fall apart.\n\nCollectively, as men in tech, we need to do a better job of calling out sexism and supporting women in tech at all levels. The gender ratio is appalling and embarrassing and reflects very poorly on our industry. It is partially a societal issue because society does not expect women to become software engineers. But if you think that men in tech are free of all blame, then you are a part of the problem. We need to encourage and mentor women in tech. I'm not saying that all men are part of the problem, but collectively, we are the problem.  **We need to stop pretending that the problem doesn't exist and start asking ourselves what can we do to fix the gender gap.** Listing anecdotes of \"reverse sexism\" that you think you've experienced does not count.\n\nI'm not saying that some tech companies don't offer positions to less qualified applicants because they're women. It happens, and when it does, it sucks. It's not fair to men or women when it does. However, that's a minuscule problem compared to the sexism that women experience every day in the office and classroom. The levels of women in CS at top companies and at top CS programs is relatively comparable, so when people assume that women are less qualified, it's saying that men are smarter than women, which is wrong and incredibly demoralizing to the women who are trying their hardest to succeed.\n\nYou may not be sexist at the office, and I applaud you if you aren't. But being sexist on the internet isn't much better. You may not say anything sexist at the office or on the internet, and you may actually be a feminist, but your failure  to call out and challenge sexist men is deafening. We should all be proactive in calling out and fighting sexism, wherever it is.\n\nAnd before anyone dismisses me as a pissed off woman, I'm actually a pissed off straight white male. \n\nI'm very open to a discussion about this, but I think we can all work together to making the tech industry and CS programs nationwide more accepting for women. Think about how much better our industry, our jobs, and our classrooms would be if we eliminated the gender gap. Let's all be leaders in making it happen.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and formatting",

I pretended not to hear it, got up a minute later (to not make it obvious) and left the areas and watched my daughter on the track above the gym to watch. \n\nLong story short, I just finished up dropping my daughter off and the woman came over and thanked me for stepping to another area but then apologized for her comment and felt she was being rude. She said she didn't think I was a pervert or anything, somehow knew I was a nurse, and just explained that exposing herself in front of a guy made her feel uncomfortable, but that it's not my concern, it's hers. She then showed me that she brought some kind of hoop covering so she could watch her kid but still feed her infant. I thought it was nice of her. Thoughts? \n\nJust and FYI, no I wouldn't have confronted her, no I didn't think it was my responsibility or obligation to leave but I felt it was the nice thing for me to do. I am a huge proponent of breast feeding with moderate discretion, anywhere a woman wants to. I was a bit annoyed but not hurt by her comment, I'm not a snowflake.",

    "text": "This likely a stupid question to ask here, but ... Has anyone else seen the TV show \"Mad Men\" here? What did you think? (Apologies in advance for the slightly OT nature of this Q.) **Edit**\n\nThanks to everyone who commented. Here's a general response:\n\n> Couldn't take any more of it.\n\nThat's interesting as I'm in the middle of Seasons 3 - the 1963 season - right now.\n\nI'd never seen it before and have only started watching it now as it's come up on Netflix. I'd avoided watching it because I used to work in a place that was 70%+ women and the snippets of conversation about that I caught didn't exactly make me enthusiastic.\n\nLike most people, I'd also heard how strongly feminist the show was and that made me even less interested.\n\nHowever, I have to say that I think the show's been massively oversold on the feminist angle and massively undersold on what it has to say about men and the lives of men.\n\nPerhaps the overselling on the feminist angle came later as the show took off and took off hugely with women viewers, especially (apparently) among professional women graduates in the 25-34 age group.\n\n* To take one recent example, as lead character [**Don Draper**](https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/blogs/103195/2014/04/148114-150804.jpg) rushes his wife [**Betty**](http://www.theweeklings.com/wp-content/uploads/betty.png) to the maternity ward to have their third child, a battle axe of a nurse blocks him from going any further and rudely scolds him for trying to follow his wife into the labour room.\n\nThe scene then cuts to Draper with another man ([**Dennis**](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BoMvaFJIEAA4lZX.jpg)) - a prison guard who is anxiously awaiting the birth of his first child - this man's repeated requests to find out how both his wife and child are doing are repeatedly denied by another hostile and officious nurse.\n\n* We are also repeatedly shown different views of parenting - good parenting, bad parenting, crazy parenting. And in these scenes, what comes through is that many of the women portrayed are absolutely hopeless as parents. Likewise, the importance of male figures in the lives of the children is highlighted - [**Sally**](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S8-ChyTVqog/VTs3EcJANVI/AAAAAAAAgTk/YU0PqhzAYb4/s1600/sally-then-400.jpg)'s very close relationship with her grandfather, [**Gene**](http://www.trbimg.com/img-5512f729/turbine/la-et-st-mad-men-sally-draper-20150325-003) and with [Draper](https://evesreellife.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/don-and-sally.jpg).\n\n* And while [**Peggy Olson**](http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2015/05/03/Peggy-Olson-Character-Cap.jpg) is clearly being presented as the woman of the future - bright, capable, independent and ambitious - she has both literally and symbolically sacrificed family life for her goals: [she has given up her illegitimate son for adoption by her elder sister](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_0KRN69leV-Q/SKLc7rksRPI/AAAAAAAACh0/Eetq8Qx1CPY/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/madmen4-peggy.jpg) and she is increasingly being shown as becoming alienated from her very tight-knit Brooklyn Catholic family and community.\n\n* Added to this, there is a wonderful scene with [**Jane**](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_A9fNctDQu8Q/TLS1pvvOM8I/AAAAAAAAA14/dq1JQrMtFs0/s1600/2e36glk.jpg), a 20 year-old secretary, and several of the older Ad men. Cooper, the agency's senior partner, has acquired a Rothko painting and the men are discussing how they would love to see it. Hearing this, Jane tells them that Cooper is gone for the rest of the day and starts heading off toward Cooper's office. \n\nThe men are both excited and terrified - for good reason - about going into Cooper's private office. Jane smirks patronisingly at them and gaily waltzes into Cooper's office, laughing at the men for being silly. The men then have no option but to follow her inside - i.e. because not to do so means being shamed and losing face to a young and attractive woman.\n\nWhat's interesting though is that when word of their going into the office gets around, Jane is confronted by Office Manager [**Joan**](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/madmen/images/8/8f/Joan_and_jane_stare_the_gold_violin.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20130320141128) and reprimanded for what she has done, Jane immediately bursts into tears and blames the men without a second thought.\n\nJoan, as another woman, sees through the act instantly and fires Jane for insubordination. Jane, not to be outdone, runs straight to much older man, [**Sterling**](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jane_madmen-e1428352828241.jpg?quality=90&strip=all), a senior partner in the firm, and he immediately rescinds the firing and gives Jane her job back. Not only that, but Jane goes on to marry the much older (and richer) Sterling. \n\n* And speaking of money ... When the Ad Agency is bought out by a British firm, Don Draper receives a windfall of $500,000 dollars. Until this point, he has been banished from the family home by his wife Betty for an affair he has had (that she knows about) with another woman. \n\nDespite repeated efforts of Don to allow him back home and even despite the pleas of both her children to allow Don home, Betty has steadfastly refused.\n\nBut then Don tells her of the $500,000 dollar windfall and then ... she lets him back in.\n\nThere is clearly a feminist message to *Mad Men*, but I am more and more convinced that there are other messages in there too and it might be worth a second look.",

    "text": "US political ideas for mens rights that everyone should be able to get behind? Hi guys, so I've been thinking, beyond just ranting about society, what some of the ways we could make political change that would address the problems men face in the world. Especially thinking about the sorts of proposals that people on both sides of the red pill might be able to get behind, since those are the sorts of ideas that are easier to push legislators on. These are just some of the things I've thought of, please give feedback!\n\n1. The legal system and police need to take rape and domestic abuse more seriously, regardless of gender. There needs to be more support for men who have been raped and are victims of domestic violence. Society needs to tell men it isn't okay for us to be hit or that we're supposed to \"suck it up.\" Also, more support for men and women who are perpetrators of rape and DV, anger management, mental health, etc. There are programs to help women escape domestic violence, how about programs to help guys (or girls) who know they have a problem with anger and an inclination for violence, where they can go to learn better ways of being a partner.\n\n2. Higher wages - wages that you can support a family on. How are men supposed to even provide for our families on wages these days? Wages are so much lower than they used to be. How's a man supposed to even attract a real woman in the first place if she looks at his job and knows he doesn't have the money to support kids? Sure, a woman should have the right to take a job if she wants or needs to. But the big businesses have cleverly made sure that most women NEED to take jobs, because it keeps wages low, they can pay two working people the same amount as they used to pay one, and the guys on top who marry wife after wife and support three families and a yacht and don't work a real day in their life pocket the difference.\n\n3. Better trades schools. Industrial jobs that used to be good wage jobs have been taken over by robots these days. Family wage jobs are often trades now, and we even have a shortage of some of em. Community colleges prepare you to be a nurse or a programmer, which are also great family wage jobs, but we don't have good high school and post high school programs to prepare young people to work in trades. Other countries do this, we should be able to too.\n\n4. Better PTSD and mental health support for veterans and maybe something like a modern day GI bill, for job retraining and matching. If we did it back then, we can do it today. There are programs, but they are scattershot and generally locally supported, rather than coming from the military. We have a generation of young men who have fought for us over the past ten years, have physical and mental scars, and are struggling to get by in a sucky economy with no well paying jobs.\n\n5. More male teachers in schools. Teachers should reflect the populations their school comes from, and half of students are male. I don't have great ideas for how to do this. Maybe this means paying teachers wages you can support a family on because some parts of the country do, and some sure don't, and respecting teaching and treating it like a real, proper job, like they do in Asia, and not just babysitting.\n\n6. Prison reform - support and redirect young men who have made mistakes, rather than criminalize them. End the war on drugs. Guys who are so depressed because there are no jobs who start taking opiates because at least hey they can feel good for once in their life, we need to give them good jobs, not stick them in prison for the next decade. Our societal default is to just lock them up, because hey, it makes the companies who run our prisons lots of money, and guess which companies donate lots of money to our legislators... Stop making money off of young men like they're there for your slave labor. Treat them like guys who have had a tough break who really need some respect, a good job, and maybe some life skills and anger management. Obviously I'm not talking about the actual serial killers etc here. But low-level criminals, a guy who was selling a few joints? We lock up way more young men that literally any other country in the world, and it isn't because our men are uniquely bad people, it's because we treat them like crap and the scumbags at the top try and make money off of em.",

    "text": "Talk radio host Michael Savage's Depressing Attempts to Demonize Feminism (Among Other Things) Hey everybody. I haven't posted here before but I thought this recollection is relevant, both in an alarming way and as an example of the kinds of anti-feminist rhetoric making waves not only on r/Men'sRights, r/the_donald and the alt-reich pits of 4chan, but also on nationwide daily conservative talk radio.\n\nAs a fiction writer intrigued by the depths of conspiratorial thinking, conservative talk radio is like a nightmare paradise. I started tuning in pre-election to try and comprehend some of the right's perspective, principally the stuff the right is being told by their media. Aside from a constant stream of slant and innuendo, and general fear-mongering, this segment from a few weeks back really stuck out.\n\nSavage's topic: \"an epidemic of false rape allegations perpetrated by radical feminists.\" Fitting neatly with the \"Look at what's happening to our poor boys!\" trope, he asked for callers to relay experiences of faked accusations for the purpose of slander and character assassination. His first caller was a woman in tears. She was barely able to speak about experiencing a rape in her youth that she was never able to get herself to publicly admit before. It was very hard to hear, particularly when Savage was less than accepting at first, asking her why she never came forward, asking what she hoped to get out of admitting it now. Eventually he relented and wound the conservation toward some notion of an older, better America where \"your brothers would take care of it.\" \n\nThe next caller was a guy who was utterly on board with Savage's thesis. He said that his sister-in-law cooked up a story about him molesting her kids, even coaching them to lie to lawyers, in order to discredit him and get him fired from his job (which was successful.) When asked why she would do this, he said \"she just didn't like me\" (the most suspect sentence I've ever heard, BTW). Regardless, this fakery, while manipulative and wrong, had nothing to do with feminism and/or sexual assault of feminists. So Savage was 0 for 2 on his big evil topic. \n\nThe third was a guy who was raped while attending a christian monastery. It was another sobering discussion of sexual assault and the effects it has on the body and mind, denial, acceptance, the unstable road to recovery, etc. \n\nCaller after caller...zero examples of false rape allegations. The segment concluded with a nurse who specialized in processing rape victims, she laid out all the gory details of examination, while Savage tried to derail her data and facts with ideas like \"Well if there's no clear DNA evidence, the claim must not be believed, right?\" He didn't get far on this tract. Strangely, they ended up on mutual terms when ascribing a rise in rape incidents and rape culture to violent video games, violence in films and, both inherently racist and lazy, on rap music like Kanye West. The segment trailed off into Savage basically thanking his audience for a frank discussion of a very hard topic, and then the station was barraged by ads. \n\nConsidering where things ended up, it was easy to forget how it began-- Savage wanted to hear about devious man-hating and man-destruction by means of what he sees as a pivotal radical feminist tool, the pointed finger of accusation and the presumed guilt of the men being accused. But when exposed to real people in the audience, with real experiences, there was a near unanimous 180 degree turn. As brutal and frightening as his initial topic was, and how horrific it is that such concepts are preached to the masses as being some epidemic feminazi plot, he totally failed. It was heartening in a grim way. \n\nAnyway, thought I would share this attempt to demonize feminism, particularly because the response was not only lackluster but such a reversal. Other such BS, particularly online, gets hateful and vile very quickly.",

    "text": "Is it time to leave? Or ride it out? Gonna be a long one, I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI started working for this startup in San Francisco as a software engineer a little over a year ago (right before my 23rd birthday, just turned 25) after leaving another startup that was on the way towards going under. I initially was happy, liked basically all of my 20 coworkers, and was getting paid far more than my old job (80k->120k), and the company was smaller but making more money than my old company. The boss I'd be working under was a large part of why I joined as well, he seemed very intelligent and had both leadership and technical skills. I was learning a lot from my boss and making friends at work. Life was good for the first few months. \n\nFirst steps on the downward spiral were that a few of the salespeople were let go because the company was pivoting and they weren't able to hit numbers. Understandable, but at the time one of them was the person I hung out with most outside the company. That was a bummer but didn't affect me too much otherwise.\n\nLater, the CEO brought in a senior salesperson who basically was doing the job of the existing VP of sales. This new sales woman is very immature and difficult to be around but for some reason my CEO likes her and she has lots of useful connections. VP of sales cannot work with her and says it's her or me. CEO lets VP of sales go and new sales woman becomes VP. So CEO just effectively threw out the sales dept and got a new one.\n\nAt some point after that my team (engineering) is looking for new blood. My boss brings in this guy(E) who was very eccentric and not just a little pushy and annoying. However, E's worked at some high profile companies and my boss determines that his technical skill is above and beyond. I have reservations but we hire him.\n\nAt some point he puts one of my coworkers, and eventually my boss, in a choke hold as a joke (he's very into martial arts and likes showing off). My boss comes extremely close to firing E for that but gives him a warning and he calms down a little (just a little). Things are relatively smooth for a while.\n\nThen my boss has an aside with me where he tells me his paychecks have been late and having a mortgage, a stay at home wife, two new kids, and not a lot of savings, finds this to be a problem. My paychecks have been late by a day about twice (his were more frequent and later), but I don't really care that much since I save much more than I spend and don't have anyone else relying on me for subsistence. \n\nThen my boss quits out of the blue and calls me on a Sunday to tell me so. He found another more stable company and jumped ship. I'm upset because the reason I joined the company was largely because I wanted to work with him, but I'm not too surprised. Still, I've been getting paid well and so I eventually decide to stay, though he mentions that he could be interested in migrating the rest of the team to his new company if we're interested. \n\nThis leaves a sort of power vacuum. The project manager (basically a go between for design, engineering, sales) assumes organizational leadership while E is left as the most technically experienced on the team which makes him the de facto lead engineer. This kind of works for a while and we're still able to get things done but it's very different than working with someone who's the clear leader. \n\nEventually the CEO pulls the same thing with the PM as he did with the VP of sales. He brings in someone more experienced(T), they work along side each other for a while in overlapping roles, and then suddenly the CEO fires PM (a week before his wedding no less) with no warning. I spoke with PM (who was one of the people I liked the most of the remaining original coworkers) and he was understandably livid and has it out for the CEO now. I don't blame him.\n\nI finally decide I've had enough (maybe I'm next?) and immediately after that I start looking for jobs (this is about 5 weeks ago). I set up a few interviews but shortly after, my new (3rd in a year) boss T gives me a 10k raise and a promise of a 5k bonus in November. I decide to relax my job search since this is an indicator to me that I'm not going to be fired soon.\n\nA couple weeks later, one of the members of my team gets let go. To be fair, he was probably the least productive of the 5 of us, but again there was no warning and we were told in passing at our weekly meeting that happened to be that day (I was wondering why he hadn't been in the office). I'm sure this was pushed for by E and T signed off on it. The worst part about this is that apparently T claimed that he was given warning, but when I spoke to my former team member after he claimed this wasn't the case and that he was told \"It was a decision by the team.\" Really rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nThat was last Monday. On Friday of last week one of my remaining teammates pulled me aside to get my thoughts. He told me he was thinking about leaving and I told him I've been having similar thoughts. He told me that our only other remaining original member also was, now it's just the 3 of us with E and T. So all of the original team is either gone or wants to leave. \n\nThroughout all this, other people have been fired/quit and new replacements have come in. The company is roughly the same size as a year ago but only about 1/4 is the original team. People seem to be very disposable here. \n\nI haven't quit yet because:\n\n- I'm getting paid 130k a year with benefits, unlimited PTO at age 25. Don't want to let this go lightly.\n\n- I just got a raise and have been told I'm valued so I don't thinking being fired is very likely for me.\n\n- I'm in the office at most 40 hours a week, usually a bit less. From what I understand this is better than average \nfor my industry.\n\n- I've hit my stride with our code base. I'm fairly familiar with pretty much every part of it and I can crank out features quickly now, I'm probably the more productive of the original 3 engineers left. I'm producing a fair amount even taking the time to make long reddit posts like this.\n\n- Apparently our financial issues are about to alleviate, we have several investors at $1 million each but need a lead. Once that comes we're safe for a long time.\n\n- Some of the new hires are people that I like. Not most but a few of them. Don't know them very well yet.\n\n- There are still a couple people left outside of engineering I respect and occasionally spend time outside of work with. \n\n- I don't have a better job lined up yet, because...\n\n- Interviewing takes a SIGNIFICANT chunk of time. I've stealthily left the office or come in late quite a bit and I don't want to push my luck.\n\n- With all the firings, I can see why my CEO or T did it. They were good business decisions but they just demonstrate their belief that employees are very replaceable. And this is a tech startup in San Francisco, it's true.\n\nI've slowed my job search but I have a day long interview on Friday with a fairly promising company. Don't have much else on the horizon yet but like I said I haven't been looking as much recently. I haven't asked for time off yet especially since I have a week long vacation on the calendar a week later and I've been taking chunks of days off a lot recently for other interviews. However, I've still been getting lots of work done and moving my hours around so I still work close to 40.\n\nBasically, interviewing (especially for an engineering position which is like several hour long phone calls and multiple in person meetings, one up to an entire day long) is exhausting and takes up too much of my time that I *should* be working. \n\nI know I'm not going to be at this company long term but should I really try to leave right now? I'm very comfortable where I am, money still flows in, it's just that I know it's not a long term solution and I pretty much keep to myself now, whereas I used to be fairly social at work. I just don't like most of the people here now, but then again as an engineer I don't need to interact with them much. I have friends outside of work so it's not like I'm starved for social interaction. I'm OK with this. (dog wearing hat in burning house picture)\n\nAnother option is I just go on interviews whenever I want and wait for them to fire me while collecting paychecks, but that just feels sleazy, even though this company probably doesn't deserve better.\n\n__tl;dr__ used to like my company, people left or got fired, feels like a totally different place, but I'm still getting paid well and the job isn't stressful, so should I just ride it out until it does get bad and quit or actively try to find a new job while juggling interviews and my current one?",

    "text": "Looking to start a career in robotics - did not get my degree in science - Help Okay, I'm having a hard time editing my whole spiel on this - because I feel like all of it is important info to reach out for help. I'm probably wrong... but bear with me if you can. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy whole life I have wanted to work in the field of science, but I have never had the self confidence to believe I could do it.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n**I just want to know the initial steps to driving my career this way.** I have not received my degree in engineering, and I've been in the workforce for about 3 years - none of my jobs relating to what I want to do. (*Except for MAYBE when I was a \"product designer\" for Leapfrog*)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nIdeally I would love to leave my job for some sort of entry level position at a job related to **robotics**. Right now I am working long and inconsistent hours, its making it hard to properly schedule my free time to move in the right direction. I would just do volunteer lab work - but given my lack of spare time I haven't been able to find something that works, while I still can pay for things like rent and food. I would love to just leave my job for a full time entry level position in a lab environment, something like a research assistant... but perhaps wouldn't require a degree? Does that even exist?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy interests lie in two realms of this field - one pertaining to creating “artificial bodies” and one to creating “artificial minds”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nStarting with the first; I feel the best fit would be seeking out a career in mechanical engineering. I’ve worked with “making things” my entire life to know that it's something I enjoy thoroughly and could do for a lifetime. I attended Cooper Union - which is an especially technical school; the quality of something we crafted / built was heavily stressed. I've learned to create a \"product\" from various materials, and I’m confident that I possess the grounding skills in design, physics, and construction; that would give me a solid base to grow from when acquiring the technical knowledge of machine making. I'm trying to find affordable mechanical engineering classes... but again - with my current job situation - it's hard to find something that will work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nMy other career interest pertains to skills that are more foreign to me, (which, ironically, makes me want to pursue it more) developing AI. The appeal of this field for me stems from my ongoing interest in cognitive science. During my education, these were the classes that I was very successful in, and enjoyed the most. My teachers really appreciated the projects I would present, and I was fully absorbed and involved. Though I wouldn't say I’m an expert in this area - I wouldn't say I’m a layman either. What I am lacking in is a background in computer science. Though I dedicate most of my spare time to educating myself; tinkering with basic configurations, and reading up on various subjects pertaining to it - I’m looking into taking my technical knowledge to the next level by taking classes geared towards this field. I want to turn the energy from my interest in cognitive science into fabrication, I want to learn how to materialize the thing I’ve only been able to learn about on paper and see in nature, like the mind and consciousness. So these would be the fields that would be more geared towards becoming an algorithm specialist / computer scientist of sorts. Right now I am taking some online courses... but obviously would need to do more to actually dive into this field.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n**Ideally** - I would want to find something where I could be involved in the production of both these facets… but I don't know if a career like that exists.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n**Creation of a product is the essential goal**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n*I do have a driving force behind this passion that I know is unrealistic but could maybe help contextualize what / why I want to do with my life ( in a diluted way)*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor the past couple of years, I've experienced this recurring dream :\n \n&nbsp;\n\n>In my old age, I have created the first “true” AI, that manifests itself as a small childlike robot - thus initiating the onset of the technological singularity. I am being interviewed by a woman while holding the robot in my lap. She asks if I have any regrets, and mentions that I have given up finding love, starting a family, and other things of that nature. I well up and tell her that though at the time it might not have seemed beneficial to go through those pains and hardships, finally creating this machine was my purpose and I live with no regret. I feel an overwhelming amount of happiness -- and then I wake up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nThough this is obviously fantastical; this \"dream\" encapsulates what drives my passion for this field. It might make me seem melodramatic (or even make me look like a loon) but I am willing to take any steps - to start making moves towards this career...as long as they are moving me toward the right direction. I just feel like I'm golfing in the pitch black right now... I just want to be able to at the very least see the direction I should be swinging - no matter how far away the hole is. lol god sorry for these corny things i just don't know how to describe myself\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nI would be immensely grateful for anyone that would be willing to guide me!!",

    "text": "About to leave my job: Worth it to tell my boss why? Just to explain: I have a PhD, I have about 6 years direct industry experience in addition to my degree, I started this job in February. I'm also the **only** woman in my department (engineering). There are about 130 people in the department.\n\nMy boss is a Cali hipster. Nice enough in person but he continually minimized my experience and expertise (he recommended an engineer 10 years my junior to be my \"technical mentor\"...sure, I can learn *something* from that engineer, but hardly in a mentorship role). I was passed over several times as a lead on various projects (because I lacked experience according to them, even though I had direct experience in that particular field...and knew the customer) and was instead assigned as a supporting role on different, smaller projects. At one time, he actually sent me off to make copies of an agenda instead of attending a meeting with a customer.  In short, it was insulting.\n\nAnyway, I reached out to my network, got a couple of interviews, settled on one company, and am about to accept their offer. \n\nMy question is: do I tell my boss the real reason why I am leaving or do I give vague platitudes? The real reason is that I feel like my gender hindered my advancement. I'm not going to get into the details of this, but I'm about 99.5% certain (I know my male predecessor, he had less experience than I did and got more responsibility right off the bat). \n\nMy platitudes would be along the lines of geography (\"I just want to be near my family\"...ugh).\n\nMy main concern is the trade off between my reputation vs. the women that come after me... I don't want them to think of me as the disgruntled woman engineer yet if women follow me in those footsteps, I want management at least to know that there's some serious bias in middle management against women.",

    "text": "Is this a job scam? Well, someone supposedly from my college sent out an email about a job opportunity being a Personal Assistant to an engineer who is launching a start-up company. This was about a week and a half ago. This person, lets call her Rachel, put an email address to contact the man, we'll call him Rob, who is starting this engineering company. So I emailed Rob on his personal email, and sent him my Resume. He offers the job, I accept and here is the how the further conversation took place. I've changed all the names, let's call me Bill. The first thing I did was give him information that he requested for a background check.\n\n>Me: Name: Bill\nEmail: bill@gmail.com\nMailing Address: 100 Main st\nCity: New York\nState: New York\nZipcode: 0000\nPhone number: 555-555-5555\n\n\n\n\nI gave him a false address, for a rental home we used to have, because I know my mail would just be forwarded to me.\n\n\n\n\n>Rob (person I think is trying to scam me somehow):\nGood evening Bill, your application has been accepted after thorough consideration. Good to have you on board. For now communication will be via text and email, however I'll keep you informed as soon as I make a list of things you'll do for me and email them to you.\n\n\n>Me: That's fantastic!\n\n\n>Rob: Good evening. This is just to give you more information on the nature of the job. Your basic job is to remind me of events and help me sort out things when necessary. You could also need to help me book a flight when I need to travel, I will always send funds in form of a check that will cover the bills for whatever I need you to do for me, as well as payment for your work for me. Understood?\n\n\n>Me: Yes I understand.\n\n\n>Rob: Your first assignment will be communicated across to you tomorrow (Tuesday) morning so make sure you check your mail and text for updates. Have a great evening. \n\n\n>Me: Alrighty\n\n\n\n\nI was already suspicious of this man before he even asked for background information. I have Google searched the man. Nothing comes up for his name within 50ish miles, but there is an engineering company start-up with his name in the big city that is about 180 miles from me. I also searched the woman who sent the original job offering email (Rachel) and found her actual Facebook page. She did graduate from my college, but she only has 54 friends and her profile pictures are of insects (but that is her claimed job so). I'm just at a loss at if this is real or not because neither me nor my father know if it is true. I thought it would be nice if a fresh pair of eyes had a look at this issue.",

    "text": "As a child of rape, I would understand if my mother aborted. This is for anyone who is debating having an abortion or not. I want you to know, no choice is the wrong choice. \n\nGrowing up I didn't know my donor (aka my father, but I refuse to call him by such a worthy name). The only thing I knew about him was that if my mother saw him while we were out, she would grab us and run as fast as she could in her car and race off. I had no idea what was going on. She seemed frightened. I never understood why...\n\nWhen I was 14 I met extended family from my donor's side, I finally had a chance to meet the man I had been dreaming about. The man that would make me whole and explain who I truly am. \n\nI met him and it was great. We got a long really well. I went to seem him and my family as much as possible. One day he asked to speak with my mom. I asked her and she said no. I asked why? She contained to tell me no. \n\nOne day she dropped me off at his house and he came outside and hello to her, she looked stiff and afraid and was very cold. I didn't understand. I asked her what was wrong but she ignored me and said go ahead. \n\nAfter a year of being around this man, our new found relationship started to sour. He would ask for money and use it to purchase drugs. One day I had enough. I was raised by my grandfather and he never EVER resorted to such despicable levels. Luckily I had enough common sense to know this was not right and called him to tell him I never wanted to speak to him again. He agreed and that was the end.\n\nI went to my mother and explained what happened. She said \"let's talk.\" We sat down on my bed and proceeded. \"You were born out of rape.\" I never wanted to have a child by this man.\" The day it happened he was high and beat her with my sister in the other room. She was on birth control but it failed and she found out she was pregnant a few months later. \n\nShe continued to explain that even though she called the cops, he would always come back and beat down her door and she was almost to the point of being evicted so she would let him in. She told me she didn't believe in abortion and it wasn't my fault so she decided to keep me and she does not regret it. \n\nMy heart sank. I flashed back to all the times she ran away in terror and all of the times I asked her to talk to the man who brutally beat and raped her. \n\nI asked her to continue the story and tell me everything. She continued to explain that after I was born, she tried to involve him in my life, but he continued the beating. \n\nSide story: My sister once told me how he was babysitting us while my mom worked and he was smoking crack, she smelled the smoke and pulled me into the closet to protect me. She was only 5 years old. It didn't make complete sense until now. I cry every time of think of this, my sister protecting me. That was the last time. \n\nThe final straw, after the cops had failed to keep this man from beating down her door, was the final time he visited the house high. This time he threatened my life. He picked me up in front of my mother and held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill me. I wasn't even a year old. My mother screamed and finally let him beat her bloody. \n\nShe grabbed us and drove as quickly as she could to our grandparents house. She proceeded to buy a gun and wrote his name on the bullet. \n\nLuckily she never used it. The gun went missing, we found it years later in my grandfathers room.\n\nAfter this she met my little brothers dad, he in a way helped save her. He helped save her because when this man would come around ignoring the restraining order, my brothers dad would be there and made sure my donor didn't come anywhere near us. I am eternally grateful for that. \n\nAfter I found out all of this, I broke down in tears. My mother, who over everything else was always 100% honest and so strong. Didn't tell me this sooner because she wanted me to find out who he truly was and make that decision on my own. She spoke to him in fear and waited. It still kills me to this day.\n\nI want to tell you. If I was her, I would abort. I told her I wouldn't have blamed her if she did. She had to look at me every day of my life as a constant reminder of what she went through. \n\nShe said that it wasn't my fault. \n\nI work hard everyday and have become very success and I feel she deserves everything for keeping me. I will give her what this man took. I will be buying her a house as soon so she can live comfortably out the rest of her days.\n\nI am the product of my mother. I am her strength, and her will. I have become successful because of her influence. I help others and she does. She never makes me feel anything but love. I wish I could be half the woman she is!\n\nThis man has no claim to the person I am and the person I have become. I have seen him in passing in my hometown but he does not exist in my world. No anger or hatred, just existence. \n\nSo as the child of a situation like this or any situation where you feel you need to abort the child. If they were alive, they would understand. I'm alive and I understand. \n\nIf you decide to keep them and struggle through it all. Know they will love you with everything. \n\nI would love my mother either way. So make the decision that is right for you.  \n\nI want everyone to know that she has met the love of her life now and he treats her like the queen she deserves to be and has restored her faith. \n\nIn Summary: I was the child of rape, my mother chose to keep me instead. I told her I would have understood if she did abort because if I was in that situation I would have aborted my child. I told her I would love her even if she did. No woman should have to go through what she went through.  \n\nEdit: Wow. I just woke up and saw this. Your stories brought me to tears. Thank you very much for your kind words! My mother is my pillar of strength. I'm glad she trusted me to make the right choice. After I was born he left her life, she went to school and became an engineer. She didn't finish high school so it became a turning point to be independent of men as she says. She has raised my sister and I to be very strong. We know how to fix our own cars from oil changes to tire changes, use power tools, and take care on our own. Happy Mother's day to all of the mother's out there who kept us through the pain and healing!",

    "text": "The only female sales engineer in the class - a reflection on comments made by the instructor. I am a sales engineer in a male dominated field. More times than not, I'm the only female in a class or workshop. Today was no different. \n\n\nThings that have made me angry in today's training class:\n\n\"I'd like to point out our first woman to take the class, OP!\" \n\nOveruse of gratuitous adding of \"or herrrrrrrrrr\" with stares at me. \n\n\"Before we leave even OP will know how to program this!\" \n\n\"I want to see you trying this Op!\"\n\n\"Oh now, you didn't break it, did you OP?\" (At which point my table mate angrily said \"no, she didn't.\") \n\nHe came over to show me something. I was holding the programmer. He reached one arm on either side of me, like he was teaching me to play pool on a date, to demo the programmer.\n\n\"OP you have my respect. Every other woman salesperson I've dealt with has left after lunch.\" \"Well, that doesn't have anything to do with my gender. It has to do with me being good at my job and respecting my company.\" \"Nah it's because your boss is here, right?\"\n\n\n\n\nI'm fired up. I'm so mad. I'm also 7 weeks pregnant and hormonal. And I have to hold myself back because my boss is here. 99% chance of a rage cry on my way home. \n\n\n\nUpdate: I told my boss and he said \"eh that's not that bad.\" Then the sales manager from the instructors company asked why I didn't fill out an evaluation form. I told him that the constant references to my gender and the comments made were inappropriate and uncalled for, and if they ever wanted more women sales people to stick around this is not the way to do it. He agreed it was unacceptable, and said he'd set it straight. Don't know if I believe him but I feel good now that I got it out.",

    "text": "I'm an engineer. Let's talk about bras. This is a serious post and this seems like a respectable subreddit.\n\nI am a guy, an engineer, married and have a teenage daughter. I have the utmost respect for ladies. When I have gone shopping with them, I see their struggle to find that \"perfect fitting\" bra. At any given time, they only have 2-3 that fit really well. That, and washing bras can be so precarious... elastic bands losing their elasticity, wires coming out, etc, etc.\n\nI know there are custom bra-fitting stores, but they are also outrageously expensive. That, and as a girl continues to grow into a woman, she'll soon outgrow such bras.\n\nI'd love to see an affordable modular bra on the market. Since one breast can vary in position/size/angle to the other, I imagine steps to the perfect bra would be:\n\n1. Measure each breast's cup size and angle\n2. Measure the distance between your breasts\n3. Measure the distance from each breast to the top of the shoulder\n4. Measure the circumference around the torso.\n\nWith those measurements, you would then only purchase the modular components that hook together. Benefits of such a design:\n\n* No need to throw-out the whole bra if one wire is exposed / one strap loses elasticity, etc. Just replace that individual component\n* The components can be easily swapped out to grow with one as their body changes\n* Allows for easy styling. Example: Need black cups with transparent straps to match that dress? Need a strapless bra for that other ensemble? Want straps that pull together in the back? Need a larger cup for that special time of the month? None of these things would be a problem with a modular design.\n* Mix and match components. Once you know your size, you can purchase all kinds of variations: Thick and thin straps, various colors, various styles (lacy vs solid, etc.), various features (cups that open for breastfeeding so you don't have to pull the entire bra up, etc)\n* Components could be easily unhooked and washed separately. This would result in components lasting longer.\n* Components could be easily swapped-out during the day without having to swap out the entire bra. (I'm thinking of breastfeeding moms who want to swap out the cups mid-day for a fresh feel)\n* You could have components to match your activity. Example: Going jogging? Grab that sports cup that has a small side pocket or mechanism for holding your cell phone / money (in a way that doesn't get them sweaty, heh). Wearing that dress that is a little too large in the bust? Grab your extra-padded cups to fill it out. Getting ready for that sexy time? Grab your sheer / lacy cups.\n\nWith all the options we have for accessories in other areas in life (tech, mobile, auto, etc.), I am surprised this doesn't yet exist. Or maybe it does and someone well point me in the right direction.\n\nNow, I am not a woman and don't presume to understand a woman's perspective on some of the things I've said. Please take it with a grain of salt if I missed the mark.",

    "text": "Benign chats with co-worker have resulted in me being threatened by his girlfriend. I'm a female, married, engineer for a wood mill. It's a 25:1 male to female ratio. We use chats to communicate between departments. \n\nI've been chatting with a male co-worker, of whom I have a LOT in common with. He's the kind of guy I'd probably be excellent platonic friends with. But we keep it absolutely pro at all times. I knew he had a girlfriend and respected her enough to not flirt or imply anything that could be misconstrued as inappropriate work talk. \n\nI mentioned that my hubby and i built a kickass DIY hot tub over the weekend, big enough to fit four adults. He responded that he wishes he had a hot tub. I said maybe in the future, I could invite him over for a BBQ & soak with us. He joked that his girlfriend probably wouldn't be ok with that (Cause she's inherently jealous and insecure around other women)\n\nCut to 2am last night... I'm woken up from a dead sleep with chats from 'him' blowing up my phone. This wakes my husband and I up. Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...\n\n\"I read what you said to my man. Hes right, I dont and wud never approve of you. Be a rel woman and find a man who's not taken. You're a fucking horrible woman. I'll keep an eye out for you.\"\n\nThese kind of poor grammar and awfully assuming messages continue for an hour. I turned my phone on silent.\n\nThis morning I found out she stole his phone & car in the middle of the night while he was sleeping. Cruised around with her friend while basically messaging the two women he chatted with that she thought was a sexual threat (namely me and one other woman at the mill)... My co-worker was just written up for it (Cause the messages were awfully harassing of us women and all from HIS work profile)\n\nNow, I'm looking over my shoulder to make sure she's not stalking the mill. She now knows my full name, what vehicle I drive, my cell number, and work email. He told me she doesn't work at all, and is apparently affiliated with a local gang, and one of get last messages to me says if she felt threatened again she'd 'hire someone'...\n\nAll this is petty and incredibly immature drama, I'm positive nothing is going to develop from this after today, but I needed to vent... I've NEVER experienced someone so scared or angry at other women. Not in school. Not in slutty friend/fr-enemy circles... Never.\n\n- I've told my co-worker I cannot chat with him about anything other than work from now on. And told him that if she does this kind of shit in the middle of the night again (or anytime for that matter) that I'll call the cops on HER for ongoing harassment and intent for criminal mischief. He told me \"don't do that\" he didn't want the cops called cause \"she'd be arrested again\"\n\nFACE PALM.",

    "text": "I was tricked, hacked, and blackmailed with inappropriate photos and threats. Like a Black Mirror episode, but IRL. This happened on the 8th of Feb, 2017.\n\nIt is the fucked up story of how I got hacked and blackmailed and then fucked over when I refused to cave in because I was stupid enough to give private information to 'a friend'. I didn't think Black Mirror episodes were realistic, and then it happened to me. I am sharing this because I made an idiotic mistake and it took a while for me to stop blaming myself for it - I hope that other women can read this and protect themselves (this guy was only targeting women.. as you will read on)\n\n\n**2:20pm** *I'm at work*\n\nA friend of mind messages me on Facebook. She is actually the (current/ex?) girlfriend of my ex-boyfriend's friend (sorry). I have met and hung out with her a several times but I don't talk to her much at all, though we had gone back and forth on snapchat a few days before this incident and I didn't think the way she was typing was weird. \n\nShe asks me if I could vote for her in some project for a random program. Seemed like a modeling competition she's participating in. \n\nI said cool, send me a link. \n\nShe asked me if I could be added to her group to do this, and asked if I was Apple/Android? \n\nApple. \n\nShe asked for my apple ID, then my google-circles ID (Google+?). \n\nI gave them.\n\nThen she starts flipping out and saying that adding my email ID has fucked up the system and gotten all her requests stuck. She can't add anybody else without removing me, and needs to sign into my account to remove me. It's ruined everything, and could I please please give her my password for one quick second please *just* so she can take me off the system and at least go back to the way it was? *Her career was at stake for goodness sake*, she begged.\nI was sitting in a meeting and told her that. She kept messaging me over and over and I kept telling her to stop. Then she began calling me on Facebook messenger repeatedly. At this point, after 2 or 3 calls, I was convinced she was deparate and being honest. After going back and forth for a bit.. *I fucked up.* ***I trusted her***. I thought there was no harm and I would just change the password right after. It was the password to a Gmail ID I never use anyway, except for signing up on random websites when I don't want to get their spam mail but need to create an account, you know, we all have one of those.\n\n\n**2:45pm** *Just walked out of a meeting*\n\nI sat back down at my desk and opened my hotmail browser inbox just to check it^(yes, Hotmail was my primary email.. I got my full name with no dots or underscores or numbers @hotmail.com and there are several hundred people with the same first and last name as me in my home country >_>). \n\nI noticed some emails popping up about a sign-in from somewhere in Pakistan. Within minutes, I started getting signed out of things automatically.\n\n\n**3:05pm** \n\nMy tabs began to refresh on my laptop. I had been signed out of everything: Gmail, Apple IDs, Facebook, Hotmail. I picked up my phone and watched in horror and it started to simply get wiped clean before my eyes, hanging and disappearing. The bastard had put my phone in lost mode and remotely erased all my data. He also turned on **activation lock** so that I couldn't get back into my phone even if I wanted to.\n\n\n**3:20pm** *In a small conference room with a coworker*\n\nI am distraught and my coworker is helping me, getting info on identity theft and submitting a complaint online. I'm on the phone with Apple, explaining my situation. \n\nThe hacker had gotten into my Gmail first. It was the recovery email for my Hotmail, which is my primary account, that I have held for over 13 years. Every account I have on the internet if it is important is linked to Hotmail. Bank accounts, Facebook, LinkedIn, Squarespace, Amazon, you name it. He changed the Hotmail password, recovery email and phone. My Hotmail was also my Apple ID.\n\nHe had gotten into my iCloud. Changed recovery phone, email, birthday, security questions for my Apple ID. I wasn't able to verify my identity because my answers were incorrect, the lady on the phone couldn't let me in. She escalated my call to a senior advisor. Senior was an awfully rude woman, telling me point blank she couldn't help even though I was saying I had all my confidential information on my iCloud.. photographs of my identification, bank account numbers, things he could blackmail me with. And I wasn't able to use my phone because of the activation lock. She said I would have to go into a store and give the bill for the phone (which was given to me for free by a friend, technically third-hand) with the IMEI number.. \n\nI called the bank and blocked my account.\n\n**4:00-6:00pm** *I went home, in shambles*\n\n\n**6:00-8:00pm** *At home, frantically interneting*\n\nThe hacker had been online on my Facebook all day. I had my coworker help me get in touch with my boyfriend so he could message my Facebook, pretending he was just asking why I wasn't reachable. [**This is the conversation that ensued.**](http://imgur.com/gallery/vSecL)  The hacker is typing from my account, in blue. \n\nHe wanted to talk to me. I created a new Facebook account and added my original account. He started a chat with me. **He called me on Facebook messenger (audio)**. \n\n\n**8:30pm**\n\n> He already sounds like a creep. I decide to record the entire conversation (he called on my laptop, I took a voicenote on my phone). He begins by telling me he doesn't want any drama or tears. Of course I was distraught at first but then I calmed myself and asked him what he wanted. He told me he knows the kind of person I am. He has seen all my photographs, read all my iMessages and WhatsApp chats. Seen x-rated photographs. He has access to a lot of my information that I would not want to be shared. He lectures me about how I'm a bad girl, that I have smoked weed and had sex. That if my parents knew what he did, they would be happy. That he's hacked over 90k accounts in the past 4 months and he only felt bad with a handful of girls because their profiles and phones were completely clean, and they were 'pure' and virtuous, but he was very happy when he hacked me. That I deserve it. He said I was a slut because of the number of relationships I have been in/ people I have dated since I have had that phone. I asked him if he wanted money, anything of the sort. He said he could buy me with money, so I should drop that. So I asked him what he wanted from me.\n\n***He asked me to take my clothes off and touch myself in front of him on FaceTime. Satisfy him. Only then would he give my accounts back***\n\n**I refused.**\n\n> *He said that if I didn't do it, he would post compromising photographs of me publicly on Facebook as my profile picture.* He continued to lecture me about how I deserve this. He said he didn't care if I reported him, went to the police or the FBI. He doesn't care what happens to him because he doesn't love his life like I do and he has nothing to lose. He wanted me to do this, regardless of how it would get back to him. And if I didn't, that picture would be up within 2 minutes.\n\n> **\"Do it for me only or for the world only. There's no rush at all, you can decide.\"**\n\nAll this while I am texting my parents (who are across the world in a different time zone) and my boyfriend about what he is threatening to do. My dad got on the case immediately, contacting someone he knew at Facebook to get it shut down. [My boyfriend had amassed an army of friends (through a community he runs)](http://imgur.com/a/QjuQy) and had several people ready and waiting to report my profile the minute something wrong happened. I had also asked him to call 911 and was trying to stall and keep this guy on the phone until they showed up. But I began to get upset during this call, and telling him he had no right to morally police me and that I could be in as many relationships as I want and sleep with whomever I want and it is none of his business. This made him angry. He said \"check your dp in two minutes\". \n\nHe hung up.\n\n\n**9:01pm**\n\n[***He uploaded the photograph.***](http://imgur.com/gallery/bZPPa) I was calling my parents and my boyfriend. I was in tears. Within a couple of minutes, a random friend whom I hardly speak to called my phone and asked me if I knew what was on my Facebook. She heard me crying and I said I couldn't talk. My friends were reporting, reporting, reporting. I saw my profile change. It was fucked up.\n\n\n**9:10pm**\n\nMy profile was deactivated. It wasn't up for longer than 7-10 minutes. I think at least 15 people must have seen it. At least 5-7 reached out to me immediately, through some method or the other. Boyfriend lives 3.5 hours away, immediately left home to come to me. Cops showed up and basically said they could do nothing, the hacker was across the world in Pakistan and I 'wasn't important enough for a cyber crime investigation'.\n\n\n\n**Aftermath**\n\nThe next few days were a mess.\n\n\nSpent the rest of the month trying to recover things. I recovered my Gmail within a couple of days. I looked through the account activity and saw that the guy had changed my recovery email and phone number, and now [**I had a record of it with an IP address.**](http://imgur.com/gallery/AFJuA). He had activated two step verification but we were able to retrieve it. I got Facebook back too eventually. Microsoft, on the other hand, was a fucking pain to deal with. Terrible customer service. Took me weeks to reach an actual person instead of a computer, despite my dad knowing several senior people in the company and reaching out to all for help. Apple was on hold because they wanted me to get access to Hotmail first, so I could reset the Apple ID myself.\n\nEventually I ended up losing the Hotmail account for good. After days of emailing every day, following up with senior contacts my dad had, incessantly submitting report after report. After nearly 3 weeks, someone from Hotmail called me back and said he had activated 2-step verification and there was nothing more I could do. \n\nApple, on the other hand, recently had it escalated to the highest level of engineers, who asked me questions only I could know the answer to and verified my identity that way and let me back into my account. Thank goodness for them, they were so good and supportive. Fuck Microsoft and Hotmail. People used to make fun of me for still using Hotmail and I would defend them until the end. Now I hope they lose all their customers, the shmucks. \n\nIncidentally, when I got back on my Facebook, **I saw he had messaged another 20-25 girls from my profile pretending to be me.** He tricked another friend and she lost everything too. [**This is screenshots of his conversation with her, where she HAD 2 Factor authentication and he was STILL able to convince her to give all her info away because he was pretending to be me.**](http://imgur.com/gallery/EWFv5) He nearly tricked another but she was a bit smarter. Thank fucking goodness. \n\n\n***Things are better now, but remember kids: DO NOT EVER give your personal info away, even to a close friend or loved one. BE SURE YOU TRUST THEM. Anything can happen. I don't even trust the cloud anymore. Fuck this guy for ruining my faith in humanity.***\n\n\n**TL;DR - Fucked up by giving a hacker pretending to be my friend some email info. Guy hacked every single account I have, recovered compromising info from my iCloud, blackmailed me and threatened to expose me unless I did inappropriate things for him. I refused. He uploaded. I spent the rest of the month scrambling to fix it. This shit does happen IRL. Stay safe.**\n\n\nI hope they catch the bastard.\n\n\nEdit: hyperlinks with proof",

I've asked a few HVAC tradesmen about educational resources, and the universal reply is \"leave it to the professionals.\"\n\nI'd honestly prefer to.

Ever been woken up by a woman's cold feet at 3 AM as she gets back in bed? Nope, nope, nope.\n\n**Plan B:** Design the system myself using science instead of guesswork, get someone to help pick an exact model and help install it, and consider carefully any advice they might have.\n\nI can handle enough thermo and fluids to figure out what duct configuration will stay within a given pressure band, or how many BTUs of heating/cooling the house will need.\n\nWhat I don't know is what I don't know, and I'd rather not find out later that there was a better way to do it.\n\nDoes anyone have any textbooks, trade-published reference books, or even online resources they could recommend for studying up on residential-scale HVAC engineering?",

    "text": "I feel so burnt out. Is teaching not for me? I´m feeling extremely burnt out. I dread each day and when I´m in class I feel this sense of dread and agony. \n\nA bit about my situation:\n\nI´m a 24 year old American working as a language assistant in Spain. It´s a program through the Spanish government where you work for 12 classroom hours a week and get paid a monthly grant for basic living needs. I also have a 2nd job teaching Facebook engineers English over Skype through an American company which is great for a bit of spending money but also helping me burn out faster, but I´ll stick to talking about this actual classroom job for now. \n\nThe classroom job is only two days a week, 7 hours per day, which doesn´t seem like a lot at all, but after 3 years of doing this, I feel like I cannot possibly continue. I only work 2 days a week because my school was nice and adapted my schedule to the long commute. I commute 4 hours a day (2 there, 2 back). \n\nThe biggest problem with this job is that none of the schools or teachers actually follow  the contract. I´m supposed to just be a language assistant, but they treat me as if I were their slave, or a very cheap extra teacher to boss around. According to my contract, I´m legally not allowed to ever be alone with the kids, I´m not allowed to grade exams, I´m not supposed to have to plan all of the lessons... basically I´m meant to be utilized in the classroom as an assistant or a tool to provide English conversation with the kids. In other words, there should ALWAYS be the main teacher teaching in the classroom while I assist her. I do not have any teacher training. I majored in Spanish at university.\n\nIn my 3 years of doing this job I´ve had to grade exams, create exams, teach in classrooms of 25 kids completely on my own, plan daily lessons, come up with activities on the spot, etc. \nI changed to a new school this year and I only work with one teacher and it´s just... pushed me over the edge. I spend 7 hours a day taking orders from this woman while she basically spends those days taking a break. \n\nFor example here´s how my day has gone so far:\nFirst class was the kindergarteners. Main teacher drew ballpoint pen halloween pumpkins in their notebook and told them to  color it while I was meant to walk around and teach them the colors in English, teach them how to say different words, etc. So the main English teacher who is paid almost 4 times as much as me improvised a poorly drawn pumpkin in January and expected me to improvise a lesson out of that (to 5 year olds who don´t speak a word of English, no less). \n\n2nd class was with 1st graders. There´s a flu going around so only 5 kids showed up. Main teacher asked me to think of a fun game to play with them. Main teacher sat in the back of the class to grade papers while I was left in charge of the whole class with no lesson plans.\n\n3rd class was with 3rd graders. The main teacher did activities from the workbook with the class while she sent me to the back to work with 2 students at a time (I had printed out some worksheets in preperation because she does this often). She told me I could only spend 15  minutes with each group because she wanted me to work with more students. I had to improvise a way to drastically shorten the activity.\n\netc, etc.\n\nIt´s like this every day. She is lazy and unprepared and expects me to come in and have amazing lessons with a ton of energy. I´m sick of it. The kids don´t speak a word of English and it´s just painful and exhausting. \n\nThis is all AFTER I stuck up for myself and demanded they not take advantage of me so much. Before it was much worse. Before they wanted me to have a ¨story time¨ in the library every day during the break with the ¨punished students¨ where they basically  dump 20 5-10 year olds on me and leave me alone. The main teacher wanted me to work with the entire class on my own while she colored with a few in the back. So I´ve already stuck up for myself quite a bit. The problem is that it´s such a crappy program with nobody enforcing the rules, nobody in charge that cares, and the knowledge that if I quit, there are hundreds of Americans ready to take my spot.\n\nI feel so burnt out. I have 4 months left of this school year to get through. Is this what teaching with your own classroom is like? Am I so burnt out because this is a crappy situation or because I´m not meant to be a teacher?\n\nI think something that adds to it is the absolute disorder and chaos and low quality of the classroom. It´s obvious that the main teacher never ever plans any kind of lesson. There´s no order to anything. She randomly decides to draw a face in each student´s notebook for them to color. That´s the day´s lesson. Or she yells vocabulary words at them with no rhyme or reason. It´s chaotic and nobody learns anything ever. There´s constant shouting, no actual teaching ever (other than telling them to work in their workbooks), and it feels really.... empty.\n\nI could go on and on about this for ages but I feel like this is enough info.",

    "text": "Possible to start from the beginning in IT at 34 years old? Hi, just looking for some advice on the viability of starting in a totally new career at 34 years old. I'm interested in IT and where I should start (ie, should I teach myself, be going to classes?), etc. However, I also want to know if someone my age is even hireable in those positions with no prior experience. \n\nFor background, I've pretty much been lost my whole adult life as far as career goes. Got my degree in English with a technical writing focus. This was after dropping out of college the first time and getting my cosmetology license. Then pretty much just worked odd retail jobs, was a supervisor at a call center for several years and am currently a receptionist at a salon. I'm a woman, if that makes any difference. I've always been into computers and technology, I grew up around it since my dad is an engineer. But I never really considered it a career option for myself. Not really sure why. I guess because I did better in English classes then I did in math and science so something like engineering didn't seem right for me. But I really like working and learning with things hands on. \n\nAnyway, that's pretty much the gist of it. Advice, opinions? Even if it's just to tell me there's no way, that's okay.",

    "text": "Dislike career in civil engineering so far, should I switch to mechanical or software? \n I have a bachelor's and Master's in civil engineering and I am very unhappy in my field and I don't expect to enjoy it in the future. I enjoy design work, calculations, and modeling aspects of engineering and I feel like civil engineering (for me) has been less design (and the design I do is just trying to make the regs and limits work for the topography) and in the future I see myself headed toward a managerial “paper pushing” and report writing role. \n\n\nI work in transportation right now (storm water, rail, roadway design but also master plans and reports) for a consulting firm. Admittedly my particular office has been doing more master plan projects and reports than actual design work, and other offices do more design, but senior level engineers always seem to phase out of design and do managerial stuff. So managerial roles are in my future even if I asked to switch to an office with more design work.\n\n\nIs it possible to have the experience I want for my career within the field of civil engineering, but perhaps under a different subset or type of company? \n\n\nI enjoyed the programming courses I've taken, and I really enjoyed structures, strength of materials, and statics (Dynamics was so so for me). I even considered switching to mechanical engineering during undergrad, but after speaking to a couple professors i left feeling like maybe I'm too stupid for it (I'm a woman and generally an insecure person, and I didn't want to be a negative stereotype or a liability somehow so I just stayed in civil since I already knew what it was like). Anyway, with that in mind should I consider getting a second Master's in computer science or mechanical engineering (structures or materials emphasis)? Could I \"handle it\"?\n\n\nIt would be pretty unpleasant to drop everything (401k, health insurance, income) and go back to school, but I am really down about the type of work I do now (kind of depressed and feel like I'm at an intellectual dead end) so I think it'd be worth it from a long-term quality of life standpoint. However, maybe I'm blinded by the “grass is greener” fallacy? Is software or mechanical engineering unpleasant in ways I don't see? I understand they do work long hours (I have friends in aero and software) but usually when I work long hours in design projects I don't mind it so much. Are there any books, YouTube videos, blogs, podcasts, etc that I could read/watch/listen to get a better sense of what it's really like in either field? \n\nIs there any other advice, comments, ideas you might have? I appreciate anything you might have to say at this point",

    "text": "How do I advance my career in project management when my current industry doesn't typically use them? I've got a Bachelor of Commerce from 8 years ago, did two years of teaching abroad to see the world after graduation, then came back to Canada and started working in the Trucking industry. I've got 6 years of experience on my resume as logistics planner/dispatcher/project coordinator. Making about 60K.\n\nI've been unhappy with my job for a while now due to internal issues with management. I've been doing the project coordination for about two years now and I enjoy it - I get to use my multitasking, attention to detail and problem solving skills. Unfortunately the trucking industry doesn't really use project coordinators, so the likelihood of staying in Trucking is slim. Since I am the only project coordinator on staff, the likelihood of getting any supervisory experience is non existant, and since I am a woman I find it very unlikely that I would be able to transfer to a supervisory position in another department, as I work in operations and the only women in supervisory or Management positions are in administrative roles.\n\nI've been watching the job ads for a couple months now, but any job postings that I see for project coordinators, project assistants, project schedulers etc all seem to require engineering/IT/science degrees and supervisory experience. I'm married with a mortgage and I'm the main breadwinner, so I can't just quit and go back to school full time.\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on career paths for someone with a BComm and experience in logistics/project management?",

    "text": "Dream career or dream lifestyle? Hallo I am 24 years old and I am considering a future between academia and industry. I have a degree in mechanical engineering, with a very successful thesis in machine learning. I really loved the subject and with zero background in the subject, within a couple of months I managed to improve the work of the PHD student and I got one of the best thesis in the year.\n\nI graduated at 23 (I lost a year because of severe a health issue during university) and then I worked for a year in two companies, both being in engineering. One was about a computational fluid dynamics role and the other as a machine learning engineer.\n\nNow I got accepted for a masters in machine learning at a top university, however I feel extremely nervous about my next step. I really love research and I would have followed that path if not for external influence.\n\nOn the one hand, I have my brother telling me to not pursue a PHD, because in the end it will not provide you with enough benefits for the amount of work you will be putting in (please note that he has finished his PHD at a top university with a prestigious scholarship and also managed to do quite well in his PHD). In addition several PHD students in mechanical engineering have told that there are no career prospects if I follow that route (they are really negative, borderline depression). Finally in a recent experience with a girl opened my eyes about how other people see me. To elaborate, I knew her for 3 years as a friend and she told that she liked me, we managed to bond quiet well until she asked how much money I make. At that point I asked myself why a woman would be interested in someone else other than herself if not to provide her with some benefit and specifically in financial form (in short why would she care about me, only her own benefits). It is natural for me to ask myself how much money I would need if I want to have a family. If I follow the academic path it would be highly unlikely I would succeed in that regard considering the financial returns in academia.\n\nOn the other hand, my thesis supervisor thinks I am talented and I have high potential as a researcher, I have also been told from other academics that the academic path would good for me. Furthermore, PHDs student in computer science told me not to worry too much about getting a job after a PHD in machine learning, since it will not be too difficult to get one from there (in general I have observed that computer science PHDs are way happier than mechanical engineering PHDs, maybe because of publication rate and/or activity in their sector). \n\nCoupling my current worries about the future along with future worries that will manifest due to future experiences it is logical to assume I will regret either choice, hence I am writing this to ask for advice on how unfounded my worries are or are not.\n\nMy anxiety has reached extreme levels to the point I cannot sit down and study for a couple of hours without thinking about my next step, I have become desperate to solve the problem but I keep reaching an impasse. I am a bit more inclined towards industry because let’s face it, no matter how talented you are it is still way more likely to fail in academia (it is arrogant to assume I will succeed in academia), however I still feel really bad giving up on my dream career (I am guessing your advice is welcome to the real world).\n\nThank you for your time and your patience.",

So I had some sort of breakthrough, after a week of feeling like a piece of shit.\n\nShort back story: 6 years army, 2 years at Fortune 500 defense contractor as field engineer (no degree, army experience in missiles), lost it do to my fault, went through 1.5 years of hell/depression/hell, finally stopped blaming the world and accepted things as my fault, moved to The Philippines from US. Go to Culinary school. Not interested in the sham of culinary school. Sitting here using savings to live (have enough for like 15 years of doing decently). Met wife here, had child 1 month ago. Shit is serious now.\n\nOk, sorry if that sounded like a sob story, wasn't meant to be. \n\nBack on track, after having what feels like some crisis today, I decided to do something about it and reached out to an army buddy who does well now and has a technical field job (telecom or something). Got me working on my resume, which was good, but needed updating like crazy.\n\nSo my background is as a field engineer on a missile system. I worked alone traveling middle east countries checking on these systems and reporting statuses to the army higher ups and also to my company. Lots and lots of travel, Spare parts, logistics, and training of the soldiers. I did a great job, always fixed my technical problems, made successful relationships with army warrants who had never met me, and had positive reviews every mid year review. I got my raises. I say \"Army Warrants who had never med me\" because a small few of the ones I supported as a contractor I had also served with as a young soldier.  Regardless, my company had a contract to support the mission, which I loved. After 2 years, I was forced to quit do to family issues (Brother needed in home care as he is schizophrenic and he was having it bad, no one else could help.) The second reason I left was because I had gotten wrapped up with a psychopath woman who used the shit out of me, so it was time for me to go home and figure life out.\n\nHere I am 2 years later, in the Philippines, wondering where is my life going. I show a different friend my resume and he says:\n\n>You would be best suited of logistics coordinator or logistics manager bro. Thats what your resume screams to me.\n\nI have my resume scrubbed up and ready to go for a few specific jobs. Something is holding me back and I am having 'what if' anxiety. I started to ask my actual best friend 1 question then it turned into a bunch of career focused psychology ones. I didn't know these were the things I'm thinking about.\n\n\n>if i get a job as a logistics manager, what i'm worried about, is i don't know standard logistics industry stuff. i don't know how companies are different from each other; Like, the U.S. Army does things differently and so does *former employer*\n\nHowever, to finish that thought, I know I can do a logistics job that fits my qualifications, I am worried about what expectations a company might have of me should I be interviewed or hired?\n\nThe logical part of me tells me 'they won't hire you unless you are qualified and they will show you the ins and out of the company as every company is different', but since that's just me thinking that, I am honestly not sure how true that is.\n\n\nDoes anyone relate? Answers? Advice?\n\n\n*if my format is wrong or anything wrong with post, sorry, just had a long day, let me know*",

I'll try to get to the point, as I hate when others drag on in their writing.\nSo, I'm a 16 yo kid, I'm poor (single parent, low wages) and a minority (although I pass as an American). I used to be one of the really smart kids when I was little (winning awards and stuff) but that's changed over the years. I'm a little less active in school, I feel less smart, find it hard to get motivated and am mostly depressed all the time.\nThat said, I am excited for college. I have a scholarship set up already (basically I get to go to uni for free). I'm excited for uni for several reasons: mostly because I look forward to being free of the hindrances of living with my mom (an elderly, sick woman who I love, but who makes me feel old, too, sometimes) but also because I want to FINALLY be myself and pursue my interests. My aunt (a doctor) tells me I should become a doctor too. She thinks if I work hard enough and get off my ass and pursue the dream, I can achieve it. Other people have straight-up told me I'm dumb and lazy and irresponsible and would make an awful doctor. I've been thinking about healthcare, business, law/politics and construction/agriculture mainly as fields I'm interested in.\nFacts about me\nSmarts: 3.8 gpa, mostly A student (and that's when I'm lazy) but I still feel like I'm dumb, probably because I hate myself. I'm a procrastinator, and that makes me hate myself most of the time and I don't know how to stop.\nPros: I'm artistic, creative, good with my hands, imaginative and good at analyzing literature & interpreting stuff, helping others, reading (i love reading) writing, expressing my thoughts, and -sometimes- teaching.\nCons: I'm lazy (trying to be better, though), depressed, slightly erratic, spontaneous, self-belittling, introverted.\nThings I like: Art, Literature Science (even tho I love it, I suck at it sometimes), History, Politics, Social Sciences, Psychology, Health Science\nThings I suck at/would probably suck at: Math, Physics, Engineering, Finances\nI'm torn between wanting to stay here and pursue a cheaper education which probably guarantees more money and moving out in the future OR leaving as soon as I have my bachelor's degree and studying while working & living on my own. I really, really want to live on my own as I HATE my current living situation. But I'm also open to staying, especially if it means a better situation with work in the future.\nWhat do you think?

    "text": "Are women in tech supposed to wear makeup to work/interviews? Ladies who are engineers, do you wear makeup to work? And do you wear makeup to interviews? Even if you don't normally wear any? Is it expected for women in engineering to wear makeup?\n\n\nEveryone else, do you notice or have an opinion about female engineers wearing makeup?\n\n\nAlso, does it matter if a female engineer wears makeup? Will others think that a woman without makeup is less professional or less competent as an engineer?\n\n\nI'm asking this because, despite tech being known to have an overall more relaxed dress code than other industries, I noticed that most of the women in technical roles (and other roles) working in my office have some amount of makeup on. Additionally, some female CS friends from school would put on a full face of makeup for interviews, even if they usually didn't wear any or usually only wore minimal makeup.\n\n\nI also noticed that a lot of women wear slightly more \"professional\" looking clothes than the guys. And when the guys go in the office with some free t shirt they got in college, no explanation is necessary. But if one of the girls comes in with less makeup than usual or with a relaxed outfit, she apologizes for not looking put together, and explains how she was in a hurry in the morning, etc. It's all self-commentary, and I haven't seen or heard any instances of other people ever commenting on anyone else's appearance. But even so, it's kind of...concerning? Confusing? I'm not really sure.\n\nBut it's just that there seems to be some kind of unspoken difference in how women are expected to look compared to all the other engineers. I know that gender-based appearance expectations are a pretty well-known issue at large, but I thought that with how casual tech supposedly is in regard to appearances, it wouldn't matter as much. But it seems like it does.",

    "text": "We need to have a serious and frank conversation about sexism in this sub. I am appalled by the level of sexism that is prevalent in this subreddit. Most notably, two top threads today [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rorr1/my_friend_and_i_had_too_different_interviews_how/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rlijr/software_development_how_would_you_behave_with_a/), kept reinforcing the notion that oftentimes, when a woman gets a job at a tech company, it's often got it due to their gender. Seriously, you all should be ashamed of yourselves. All of these unsubstantiated allegations from anonymous people are being upvoted and giving women in tech a bad name. \n\nWomen in tech have it insanely hard. Imagine being the only dude in a nursing program and you can see what these women are going through. Additionally, imagine if all of your accomplishments were ridiculed by everyone because \"you only got this job/promotion/project/etc. cause you're a girl.\" That would really suck and would totally destroy your confidence. \n\nTBH, for me, the women I know in tech are some of the best engineers I've ever met. I know that this is anecdotal, but the women on my team are entrusted with the largest and most important projects. They regularly deliver outstanding results and they are critical to the success of our (very large and very important) product at a Big 4. There are only three of them on our team of 20, but without them, our team and our product would fall apart.\n\nCollectively, as men in tech, we need to do a better job of calling out sexism and supporting women in tech at all levels. The gender ratio is appalling and embarrassing and reflects very poorly on our industry. It is partially a societal issue because society does not expect women to become software engineers. But if you think that men in tech are free of all blame, then you are a part of the problem. We need to encourage and mentor women in tech. I'm not saying that all men are part of the problem, but collectively, we are the problem.  **We need to stop pretending that the problem doesn't exist and start asking ourselves what can we do to fix the gender gap.** Listing anecdotes of \"reverse sexism\" that you think you've experienced does not count.\n\nI'm not saying that some tech companies don't offer positions to less qualified applicants because they're women. It happens, and when it does, it sucks. It's not fair to men or women when it does. However, that's a minuscule problem compared to the sexism that women experience every day in the office and classroom. The levels of women in CS at top companies and at top CS programs is relatively comparable, so when people assume that women are less qualified, it's saying that men are smarter than women, which is wrong and incredibly demoralizing to the women who are trying their hardest to succeed.\n\nYou may not be sexist at the office, and I applaud you if you aren't. But being sexist on the internet isn't much better. You may not say anything sexist at the office or on the internet, and you may actually be a feminist, but your failure  to call out and challenge sexist men is deafening. We should all be proactive in calling out and fighting sexism, wherever it is.\n\nAnd before anyone dismisses me as a pissed off woman, I'm actually a pissed off straight white male. \n\nI'm very open to a discussion about this, but I think we can all work together to making the tech industry and CS programs nationwide more accepting for women. Think about how much better our industry, our jobs, and our classrooms would be if we eliminated the gender gap. Let's all be leaders in making it happen.\n\nEDIT: Grammar and formatting",

    "text": "Feeling invisible at school and with a future career as a developer. I’m a junior in the last legs of my CS degree, studying at an predominantly white college. Looking around at silicon valley and the dev communities in the cities near me (NY, Boston, DC), I honestly don’t feel like I belong in this field. I’m a woman and Pacific Islander, I didn’t grow up with a Mozart-like childhood, and only started programming when I took my first CS class freshman year. I didn’t have a lot of encouragement or role models before I entered college, (my older sibling went to college for a year, got kicked out, and went back to study a liberal arts field). Despite a bumpy upbringing, I graduated in the top 5% of my high school, and now attend a school in the top 20 for CS. I do fine in my classes, so academically, I’m fine. \n \nI haven’t met a single Pacific Islander at my school other than my own sister, and women in the CS department are scarce too (something to the tune of <15%). Because I’m Asian as well, I’m frequently lumped with the prodigy-Asian crowd, students who’ve been programming since they were 16 and are crazy connected. I can’t even apply to programs intended for racially underrepresented minorities since those are targeted towards Hispanic and Black students, and Pacific Islander folks are brushed over. Just talking with some of the other women in CS is pretty alienating for me, we don’t watch the same TV shows, read the same books, or have common experiences from our backgrounds. I don’t have anyone to look up to as a role model, save for maybe Melinda Gates and Sheryl Sandberg, but both those ladies are white. \n\nJust taking a scan across my classroom is disheartening, and I feel like me and my struggles are completely invisible. I feel capable as an engineer, but like I will never fully belong the way a white or Asian person will. I don’t think I can be happy just ignoring my background and cranking out code at a job when I graduate, yet acknowledging my race and ethnicity is incredibly difficult when there’s not a single person out there for me to look to. I’ve applied to a ton (70+) of internships, and gotten rejected from all, so that probably doesn’t help either. I’ve begun to think that CS just isn’t for me, and that I can still make a career out of non-tech roles. That’s really not what I want to do though, my dream is to work as a developer when I graduate. I just feel so swept aside and that there really isn’t a place I belong. What can I do to look forward instead of down? Is there a community out there that I can reach out to? Any other companies with jobs/internships that cater to minority students?",

I'm a CS engineer, we talked for a few minutes and then he left because he was giving a speech a few hours later, which he invited me to. I've been trying to leave the company I'm currently working for and this seemed like the best chance I could get so when he finished his presentation I waited until all the people that gathered around him were gone and made my approach. I straight up asked him what I could do to join his team.\n\n\nHe put me in contact with the right people and last week I had 2 phone interviews, one with the head of HR (thursday) and an other with the woman in charge of IT recruitment (friday). Both went great and this week I'm supposed to be having one with the person that would be my manager.\n\n\nI invited my dad for lunch on sunday since I hadn't seen him in like a month and this came up. After I was done telling him all the details he looked at me and said: 'You know you, your aunt is really close with the owner of that bank'. He said that she could help me land that job or if I happen to get it on my own maybe she could help me get a better salary.\n\n\nI have over 7 years of experience and I'm pretty confident in my skills, so I'm wondering if I should even play that card. Should I use this as my last resource? Should I just let it go if this weeks interview doesn't go well? If I do get hired because of this and people in the office find out, would they think less of me as a professional?\n\n---\n\nTL;DR Applying for a job and dad said his sister could talk to the owner or some other higher ups into hiring me / giving me a better salary",

    "text": "MeToo is a game changer -- but not in the way feminists think Feminists have never been very good at predicting the future.  \n\nThey assumed feminism would increase female happiness.   Female happiness has been declining since the 70's.   \n\nThey assumed that trying to eliminate the female gender role would create rough parity in previously male dominated occupations.   In fact, in countries where women have the highest degree of choice, women are *least* likely to become engineers; conversely, countries like Iran and China lead all nations in female engineering.  \n\nThey assumed that destroying the \"patriarchal\" family would eliminate child abuse and allow children to grow up healthy and happy.   In fact, children from single mother households fare worse on all quality of life indicators.   \n\nThey assumed that domestic violence was a patriarchal conspiracy.   In fact, hundreds of studies reveal that women are more likely to engage in unilateral violence against their partners, and lesbians have the highest rates of DV.   \n\nThey assumed that women in power would be more peaceful.  In fact, studies have now revealed that Queens were more likely to initiate wars than kings.  Female leaders ranging from Margaret Thatcher to Hillary Clinton were positively eager to engage in military violence.  \n\nI could go on indefinitely.   The point is that feminists have gotten *almost everything wrong.*   It is nothing short of remarkable that they continue to dominate academic discourse on gender given their near-100 percent failure rate.   Any theory worth its salt should be somewhat predictive; feminist theory is *counter-predictive*.  In no other discipline (save perhaps economics) do we see such a disconnect from reality.   \n\nI can only conclude that the wild success of feminism owes almost entirely to what they call \"benevolent sexism.\"   Men and women in academia have been exceedingly reluctant to debunk their arguments because patriarchy theory is, in fact, horseshit: men want to support women, not oppress them.   And they will support women even when they are clearly wrong.   \n\nThat brings us to MeToo.   Collectively it is Time magazine's \"person of the year.\"   The once charming and beautiful -- now wretched -- Ashley Judd even posed for the cover photo.   \n\nFeminists have been content to see their ideology run wild.   They have wielded female power (which they bizarrely deny even exists) to brutalize men and boys.   They were fine with denying children access to their fathers, turning fathers into indentured servants,  ignoring the role that women play in domestic/sexual violence, shutting down talks on male suicide, disadvantaging boys in \"education\", discriminating against men in hiring practices, allowing false accusations to run rampant, and so on and so forth. \n\nHowever, in the last week or so, I've noticed a change in tune.   Feminists are extremely worried that \"MeToo\" may end up creating a \"blowback\" effect on women.   We're talking about bourgeois women mind you -- because that's what feminists are.  Spoiled, rich, women.    I've noticed contradictory statements in \"MeToo\" articles within single paragraphs -- NO, men shouldn't flirt with women in the workplace, but YES, men should flirt with women in the workplace (the right *kind* of man, you see).   The unspoken subtext is that women should still be permitted to use their sexual power where they see fit.   Cake and eat it too.  \n\nThere is a growing recognition that a pandora's box has been opened.   What if men start to view women as threats?   If an \"alpha\" male can be taken down over a mere accusation with no proof, what about your average man?   What about my son!?  \n\nIn fact, wouldn't it be the *responsible* thing for a man with a wife and kids to make sure there is always a chaperone present so he doesn't put his family at risk?  \n\nAll of a sudden those stodgy old Victorian rules are starting to look mighty sensible.   Maybe the sexes *should* be segregated.   Otherwise, how is a man to protect himself?  Nevermind the woman's honor, what about the man's honor?  Hell, maybe that's why such rules were created in the first place!  \n\nFeminists are incapable of thinking too far ahead -- let's just say they're not exactly grand master chess players -- but the alarm bells are already going off in their heads.   \n\nWhat if men decide not to privilege me in the workplace?  What if I can't use my sexual power over men to get ahead?  What if I have to work for a living?   \n\nI'm sympathetic toward working class women.   They didn't ask for this neo-Victorian sexual panic.   They suffer actual hardships in life -- rather than a pat on the ass.  \n\nBe that as it may, MeTOO is a game changer.   Despite what some feminists think, men do not desire to be punching bags; they will try to protect themselves.   And that means no more special goodies and privileges for women in the workplace.  Women will have to pull their weight.   That also means no more drinks, lunches, and sincere efforts by older men to give young women a leg up.  \n\nIn fact -- and I hate to sound too MGTOW about all this -- but I think MeTOO will eventually bring us back to [sex segregation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGjidOQgGDE) -- precisely the thing the original feminists fought against.    You abused your power ladies, and now it's time to reap the whirlwind.  \n\nFeminists are now saying, \"It's time to take a step back.\"  Too late.  You made your bed.  Now sleep in it.",

    "text": "If you’re a man with a camera, you’re automatically branded a creep I used to work semi-professionally as a photographer.  What do I mean by that?  Essentially I was part time.  I had a great job as a software engineer that I liked and didn’t want to give up, but in my off hours I liked switching gears by earning extra dollars via photography.  I specialized in taking photos of the performing arts such as musical artists, plays, circuses, etc.  It was fun.  It was a very different challenge from writing code.  \n\nSo this 16 year-old girl found my web site and liked what I saw.  She needed some quality photos for her school’s yearbook and approached me to take them.  She asked me to take photos appropriate to the yearbook.  Not once did she ever request any nudity or anything else inappropriate.  She had an after school job and enough money to pay my rates.  Everything seemed completely legit.  Of course, I was well aware of the stereotypes that would brand me some kind of sick perv if I photographed a teenage girl.  I therefore turned to other photographers for advice on putting together a contract that would protect me legally.  She wanted a photos of her together with her horse.  There would be photos of her riding it, grooming it, and just standing beside it.  Nothing wrong with that, of course.  I still wanted a contract to protect me legally so that I would not end up falsely accused of any wrongdoing.  A protective instinct kicked in because I knew how hyper-negative people get toward men, especially a man with a camera.  \n\nI asked other photographers on a photography forum online if there were some kind of standard protective contract I could use.  Some photographers responded with good advice on where I could get such a thing.  Some also said I should require at least one parent present at the shoot.  Good advice.  However, others went berserk, accusing me of being some kind of perv out to rape that girl.  One asshole claimed that if it were his daughter he would immediately contact the police and the courts and get a restraining order against me.  He acted like I had proposed to make kiddie porn.  We’re talking about a photo shoot of a fully clothed girl in normal pictures with her horse – feeding it, riding it, normal stuff.  These were photos that were appropriate to a high school yearbook.  \n\nThese male-bashing bigots totally ignored my explanation of the content of the shoot and just assumed I would ask her to take her clothes off and do pervy things and that it would end with me raping her.  No amount of setting the record straight did any good.  It was unreal the hateful assumptions people made.  Some photographers came to my defense, appalled as I was at the overreaction.  Some correctly said that photographers photograph all ages.  Duh.  It totally depends on the content of the photos as to whether it’s appropriate.  It’s unreal how some people heard “fully clothed girl riding a horse” and translated that to “perv raping a teenager.”  \n\nI ended up doing the shoot, no thanks to the male-bashing bigots.  It went great.  I had a liability contract and I had her father present at the shoot.  Great guy, and great girl.  They were awesome people.  Neither of them made any of the absurd assumptions some idiots had made.  This was a case of a young woman who had earned her own money at a job and had chosen to spend it on some high quality photos.  Nothing more.  It’s unreal how some people will twist something like that into something sick.  \n\nOther photographers have told me about similar situations where they’re assumed to be some kind of perv because they have a camera with a telephoto lens.  If you’re a man and you take a high-end camera to a beach, you risk getting pestered and even arrested by police.  That’s a reason why I won’t even do beach photography.  Nowadays, I won’t even photograph someone who’s underage unless I know the people really well.  I was lucky at this shoot that they turned out to be terrific people, but if I had gotten the witch hunt idiots, it could have been dangerous for me.  I’m 100 percent certain if I were a woman, the whole overreaction and branding me as some kind of creep or perv would never have gone down.  “Girl with her horse” – he must be a sicko.  It’s unreal.",

My hope is that you all can glean bits and pieces to use for your own arguments in the future, and better prepare yourselves to disabuse people of the pervasive feminist ideology that surrounds education.\n_________________________________________\nThis is beautiful, like a pile of shit sculpted into an image of the Virgin Mary is beautiful. Yea, the sentiment is nice, but the content is still a smelly pile of shit.\n\nWhat he said may have been true for your generation, but his generation is facing a wave of feminist ideology and policy that puts women as frontrunners in any and all STEM categories. Beginning in grade school, where common core math was developed around the mind of girls, so that it may be more accessible and easier to learn for them. Basically taking traditional math and re-interpreting it through a verbal mindset. \n\nBefore I get into the education aspect, let me briefly refute his \"women suffer for being women\" bulk. \n\n\"I was not bombarded by images and slogans telling me that my true worth was in how I look\"\n\nReally? \n\n[Men are idiots](http://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/articles/1075515/commercials-sexist-towards-men)\n\n[Unrealistic male body standards](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jessica-lovejoy/body-image-issues-are-not-just-for-women_b_5034285.html)\n\nThe same issues exist for men and boys. We just don't talk about it. In the second article, where a boy posted a picture saying \"It's just as hard to be Ken as Barbie,\" the response was \"suck it up, white boy.\"\n\nWhen it comes to women, there is boundless empathy for women to be who they are and define themselves. When it comes to men and boys, it's \"sit down and shut up, because your feelings don't matter.\" \n\nNot only that, but women perpetuate the unrealistic expectations of male appearance. Men are willing to date down, and to date a variety of body types. Curvy? Sure! Slim, that's hot! Big booty? Sign me up! \n\nWomen? Not so much. Studies show women typically will not \"date down.\" So if a woman makes more than a man, chances are she will not date him. Even if he is more attractive. He has to be both attractive and successful. And attraction is more narrowly defined. Under 5'10\"? Move along, shorty. Chubby? Please. If you don't have chiseled abs and broad shoulders, you need not apply. Male pattern baldness? HAHAHAHA\nAnd I don't want no scrub.\n\n\"I was not overlooked by teachers who assumed that I did not understand a tough math or science concept was, after all, because of my gender\"\n\nIt's obvious from this statement that he's white knighting for attention, not speaking from experience. Because women make up 70% of teachers, and girls actually get better grades for the exact [same work as boys](http://www.returnofkings.com/75159/study-shows-girls-get-better-grades-for-the-same-work-as-boys). There is inherent gender bias in schools, but it's not against girls. \n\n\"Jared is autistic and he suffers from Lupus and avascular necrosis in both his hips.\" He wrote this editorial because he's a social outcast, and this is likely the only attention from women he's ever gotten. I know that's harsh. But he's whiteknighting for attention, looking for a pat on the cheek because he can't get a kiss, and his perpetuation of false bias against girls in education is harmful.\n\n[Common core for girls](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/education/reports/2014/10/28/99435/for-women-and-girls-the-common-core-is-a-step-toward-greater-equity/)\n\nThe feminist agenda is based on lies and misrepresentation, with the the core ideology that women are perpetual victims. This is why women who truly believe in equality and the capability of women reject it. Frankly, it's insulting. It's an ideology that, at it's core, removes the agency of women, by both making them into permanent victims and diminishing the value of their choices. \n\nLet's look at that article. \n\n\"In particular, girls of color and girls from low-income backgrounds underperform academically compared with their white, higher-income peers.\"\n\nFirst, it perverts a race and socio-economic issue into a gender-based one. It co-opts the struggles of minorities and poor people into a gender-based narrative, and by doing so, removes the focus from those disenfranchised groups. Instead of focusing on black and poor people in education, we focus on women. And so instead of developing a plan around providing those subgroups with equal opportunities to quality education, we developed common core. \n\nMisleading society to believe that women are suffering from \"the patriarchy\" by changing the narrative is not only morally reprehensible, it has a real negative effect on those groups who are truly suffering. By framing the education gap in racial and economic backgrounds as a gender issue, feminism has prevented those groups from receiving the redress they need and deserve. \n\nBy it's own damn source, linked as a PDF in the article, you can see that white girls (39% SCI/44% MAT) perform better than both all boys (35% / 36%) and girls (28% / 35%), in both science and math (using the National 8th Grade Assessment proficiency levels). Were it not for the extremely low outliers of black (9%) and hispanic (13%) girls, girls as a whole would likely perform just as well as boys in science. And they already perform just as well as boys in math (35% vs. 36%). \n\nAnalyzing the data correctly, the question isn't, \"why are girls performing worse in science and math?\" but \"why is there such a large disparity between minority girls and their boy counterparts, in science proficiency?\"\n\nBut instead of focusing on the real issue, that minority girls aren't connecting with their science education, and that minorities, as a whole, are receiving a poorer education than their white counterparts, this article talks about how girls the nation over \"also often lack access to high-quality, rigorous courses, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and math, or STEM.\" Which is total and utter bullshit. That access is based on socio-economic background, not gender. It should be overtly obvious that there is no barrier to entry girls face in the same school as boys, but feminism wants to paint a picture of female repression. So it goes on to selectively discuss lower rates of AP test takers in specific STEM fields. If girls are taking AP STEM classes at lower rates than boys, it MUST be because they simply don't have access to those classes, there must be something preventing them from enrolling, whether that be patriarchal gender norms, or a systemic failure to prepare them, right?\n\n\"Girls and students of color take the Advanced Placement, or AP, exam for computer science at lower rates and pass less frequently than boys and white students. About 30,000 students took the most recent AP exam for computer science...Less than 25 percent of test-takers were girls...Girls are underrepresented among AP test-takers in nearly all STEM fields. In 2013, for each female student that took the Physics C exam, more than 2.5 male students took the same test. Boys took the the Physics B exam at a rate of nearly 2-to-1 compared to girls and took the Calculus BC exam at a rate of nearly 1.5-to-1 in the same year.\"\n\nBeing an informed individual, I could smell the bullshit on this immediately, so I decided to go straight to the source, and found the [AP program summary report.](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/research/2016/Program-Summary-Report-2016.pdf)\n\nThey use 2013 numbers, but this is a 2016 report, so I expect some variance, but if the problem is systemic gender bias, the patterns should hold. Let's see.\n\nOut of 37 tests, women test takers outnumber men in 25 categories. Of the remaining 12, many were so close as to be negligible (4 categories separated by less than a 1% margin). So of 37 tests, female students were approximately equal to or above the number of male test takers in 29 of 37 tests. \n\nOh, but we're discussing STEM. It's a safe assumption that every test not used as an example in the article was dominated by female students, or at least had equal representation, because their selective citation bullshit is key to painting their narrative of female repression. Again, let's see.\n\nIn biology, female students accounted for over 50% more test takers than males. In calc AB, the variance was in favor of males by less than 2%. In chemistry, less than a single percentage point. In psychology, about a 90% gap above men. In statistics, almost 4% in favor of girls. \n\nSo literally the only variances that favored men were listed in the article. Notice how it tried to present those examples as a representation of the gender gap problem, not as the comprehensive list of every credible disparity in favor of males?\n\nIt's so bias it's almost laughable, except for the fact that people buy into this shit and boys are suffering for it the nation over. So because males represent 75% of computer science students, there's obviously a barrier to entry for women. Clearly girls don't have access to equal STEM education. The fact that girls represent almost 70% of all psychology test takers, or 65% of biology test takers, just means that feminism is working, and girls are taking their rightful place above men, though, right? \n\nThe fact of the matter is, girls don't like computer science. It's really simple. And is that such a big problem? Is it not enough that girls already match or dominate in 78% of AP classes? Are boys not allowed to have ONE educational field that they dominate without reproach, for simply being drawn to it? \n\n\"Girls are underrepresented among AP test-takers in nearly all STEM fields\" I've shown that that was a blatant, boldfaced, flat-out lie. Not only that, they are indeed overrepresented in advanced high school education. Girls were 56% of AP students in 2016.\n\nSo when do we decide we've reached equality? When girls are the majority and outperform boys in every category? Because the current statistics show that girls have every opportunity as boys do, if not more. Of course, the article ends with the all-time favorite feminist myth \"wage gap.\" Which, no matter how many times has been proven to be unequivocally false, a misrepresentation of statistics that doesn't take into account career field, tenure, etc., it still gets repeated ad nauseam. Similarly, we still propagate this \"girls are struggling\" bullshit, and focus our attention and resources on fixing that nonexistent issue.\n\nThe result is a lower quality education for both girls and boys. In grade school, he may not have been told that Legos were not for his gender, but god forbid the author of your editorial wanted to pick up a baby doll. The treatment amongst girls and boys for crossing the gender barrier is exponentially less forgiving to boys than girls. In fact, most little boys will accept the tom-boy girl once she proves herself to them. Boys will at first reject, and protect the group, but once you're in the group, you're in. A girl that proves she can hang with the boys is accepted. On the other hand, little boys who want to play with dolls or dress effeminately will face backlash from all sides of their peers. Adult society has come to accept them, and even welcomes them, as it falls in line with the pervasive feminist agenda. \n\nBut little girls want nothing to do with effeminate little boys, because they're still boys - they can't ever be part of the club. And other little boys will mercilessly torment them for going against the status quo. They will never find popular acceptance, and their isolation and abuse will only grow in time. There's a reason \"that's gay\" became synonymous with \"that's stupid\" in the 90's; without their knowledge, children were perpetuating homophobic attitudes that they absorbed from their parents and society, and it expressed itself through cognitive linguistics. Now, despite widespread support of the LGBT community, my generation struggles to overcome internalized homophobia that it wasn't even aware of, because it's been incorporated into their thought processes since before they even knew that \"gay\" meant anything other than \"stupid.\" \n\nThat doesn't take into account the hostile environment school is for boys, in general, now. It's no wonder boys are dropping out and performing worse at alarmingly high rates when \"no tolerance\" policies are the norm - when typical boy behavior, like roughhousing/mock fighting and fascination with guns and violence is outlawed. When you get detention for playing tag, when you can't wrestle with your friends like you do at home in your backyard, when you get suspended for drawing a picture of a gun, when GI joes are the devil's playthings, why would you like school? They've criminalized all the ways a young boy is naturally inclined to enjoy himself during his free time, and then have literally redesigned the entire education system and process to focus on girls - on the way they think and what they're interested in. Then boys grow up, begin looking at colleges, and are told that they've had all the opportunities and help, that no one wants them because they aren't a \"special group,\" and that they have to be twice as qualified as the next kid to make it anywhere. You're a white boy applying for a scholarship? Can't you just pay in privilege? Please, scholarships are for the disadvantaged women. You know, the one's who outnumbered you in your AP biology and psychology classes. And 20 others. Because they're underrepresented. Can't you just join the military and die for us instead?\n\nBut really, at the university level, there is absolutely no shortage of scholarships available to women to enter STEM fields. In fact, some universities went so far as to demand equal enrollment of women as men, creating an artificial equality that actively denied men the right to an education, all for the appearance of equality. The results were universally disastrous, with many programs being forced to shut down because they couldn't meet minimum enrollment requirements, with women as the limiting factors. There are universities that went a year without a chemistry department because enrollment fell when women decided they truly didn't want to be a part of the STEM program they were pushed into, and transferred to majors that were more suited to their actual desires. The fact is, most women don't see an appeal in classic STEM fields, but we've decided that equality doesn't mean equal opportunity, but equal outcomes. So it isn't enough for women to have more and easier access to STEM programs, they must also choose to enter those programs, even when it makes them unhappy. We're fighting for equality that no one actually wants; we're telling women to choose STEM, even when they don't want to, and in doing so are actually regressing equality by limiting women's choices, in admonishing any decisions they make that don't align with the narrative. We're telling women that their choice to enter social work isn't as valid as entering hard sciences. This is despite the fact that women provably prefer fields of study that involve social interaction and the study of people - fields where their feelings are considered important and pivotal, rather than dismissed in totality, like the hard sciences. This is why when women choose a hard science, they often choose psychology, or else in the medical field, pediatrics or general medicine. But despite the fact that psychology is an overwhelmingly female dominated field of study and profession, there is no call for a 50% outcome. Feminist ideology has conflated the belief that equal access, which is important, should result in equal outcomes, which is not important: outcomes are the result of personal choices, people making decisions that make them happiest. And by demanding equal outcomes, feminists are diminishing those choices of women to pursue the paths they feel a natural inclination for. \n\nEquality is recognizing that men and women both face unique struggles that may limit them from pursuing their hearts' desire, and trying to alleviate those disadvantages; feminism is the belief that there is no core difference between men and women, and therefore any difference in gender representation is a result of patriarchal repression, albeit systematically directly or systemically indirectly (eg. discrimination in admittance/hiring versus constructed gender roles and societal pressure/judgement). The result is that women feel diminished for following their dreams and face undue scrutiny for being gifted opportunities they didn't earn, but didn't ask for. The author addresses this scrutiny in his last paragraph, but fails to question where that scrutiny stems from. Feminism is creating the problems it seeks to address. And men are suffering as well. Besides the arbitrary rejection from the pursuit of their desired education and careers, the barriers to entry and exclusion from the education process has resulted in worse performance by men and boys at literally every level of education, from grade school through college. Not just worse than previously, but worse than women as well. It's not that men have it better but are seeing a decrease in their disparate well-being, but men are already worse off and are seeing steady decline.",

    "text": "Reading this practically broke my brain - not just what was written, but *where* - Rebecca Solnit (author of 'Men Explain Things To Me') - in the London Review of Books No joke - this is the *first* sentence of a 3,500+ word jeremiad ('essay' is clearly not applicable in this case):\n\n> Women told me they had flashbacks to hideous episodes in their past after the second presidential debate on 9 October, or couldn’t sleep, or had nightmares.\n\nLet me be clear - I think Trump is a buffoon. I stated this publicly long, long before his election. Just before his election, after the day of his election, and nothing he has done since has persuaded me from this opinion (it has in fact entrenched it).\n\nBut despite that, the way Solnit chooses to describe him in this essay - even to me, someone who is **not** a fan of Trump - is just beyond fucking absurd:\n\n> Trump roamed, loomed, glowered, snarled and appeared to copulate with his podium, grasping it with both hands and swaying his hips, seeming briefly lost in reverie. The menace was so dramatic, so Hitchcockian, that the Hollywood composer Danny Elfman wrote a soundtrack for a video edit playing up all the most ominous moments. \n\nReally? WTF???\n\nAnd yet still people find it hard to believe Clinton's campaign lost her the **actual** election (let's leave aside the popular vote issue for the moment - and perhaps longer than a moment, but that's a discussion for another day).\n\nMy italics in all quotes that follow:\n\n> ‘Watching Trump lurching behind Hillary during the debate felt a bit like a zombie movie,’ Elfman said. ‘Like at any moment he was going to attack her, rip off her head, and eat her brains.’ *Friends told me they thought he might assault her; I thought it possible myself as I watched him roam and rage.*\n\nIt's often said these days that 'hysteria' is a gendered slur on the grounds that the etymology of the word is, according to the OED,: \"via Latin from Greek *husterikos* ‘of the womb’, from *hustera* ‘womb’ (hysteria being thought to be specific to women and associated with the womb).\"\n\nBut ... almost no one who uses the word actually *knows* that this is its origin and on that basis it is a point of near total irrelevance to raise it at all - for its primary modern meaning (from the same dictionary) is \"a wildly emotional and exaggerated reaction\".\n\nTrying to claim that people *actually* and *genuinely* believed that they thought Trump \"might assault\" Clinton - on live television to tens of millions of Americans and that Solnit \"thought it possible\" herself is - *surely* - the very definition of hysterical, no?\n\nBelieve it or not, Solnit has made these points in just 253 words out of over 3,500! \n\nShe continues:\n\n> Like many men throughout the election, [Trump] appeared to be outraged that she was in it. The election, that is. And her space.\n\nAnd continues:\n\n> Earlier in the campaign he’d urged his supporters to shoot her. \n\nThis is so obviously false that it literally breaks my brain that the editors of the *London Review of Books* (LRB) allowed it to be published. Now don't let's be mistaken - the LRB is a Left, even far Left, organ and unashamedly so - and fair enough, right? Everyone is entitled to his or  her point of view, right? (Excuse the TYT Cenk-like 'right?', 'right'? verbal tic there). \n\nYet the calibre of its usual contributors includes the likes of Professor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford, [Diarmaid MacCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarmaid_MacCulloch),  Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, [Mary Beard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Beard_(classicist)), Professor of History at Columbia University, [Adam Tooze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Tooze), and Professor of Early Modern History at Queen Mary University of London. [Miri Rubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miri_Rubin).\n\nMy point being that even if you disagree with the beliefs and politics of such people as those I just mentioned, at least you can concede that they are not complete imbeciles that produce utterly baseless trash such as Trump had \"urged his supporters to shoot\" Clinton.\n\nIf that were **actually** the case, then Trump would be incarcerated right now. But not only is he **not** in prison, but he is in fact the President (elect).\n\nBut, perversely, that is yet just more grist to Solnit's mill - on the particular version of Bizarro world that she must surely inhabit, the very fact that Trump has not been incarcerated on the grounds of that frankly ludicrous allegation is - the reader is left to infer - the very proof that the United States is a society that - in the memorable words of of Chloe Angyal - [\"hates women. Just ... hates us.\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbfKzXa6pjg) (Angyal was, notoriously, saying this to [Sabrina Rubin Erdeley](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/oct/20/rolling-stone-reporter-admits-mistakes-in-jackie-article) following the publication of *that* *Rolling Stone* story ... you know ... the one that was [total and utter bullshit](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/rolling-stone-writer-uva-rape-story-nightmare-article-1.2698465)).\n\nSpeaking of which, Solnit is at this point just getting into her stride ...\n\n> Trump is patriarchy ...\n\nShe's dropped the 'P'-bomb already ... still barely past the beginning of this text by the way.\n\n> Trump is patriarchy unbuttoned, paunchy, in a baggy suit, with his hair oozing and his lips flapping and his face squinching into clownish expressions of mockery and rage and self-congratulation. \n\nWell, he is a 70-year-old man after all. \n\nI mean, Heaven fucking Forefend that [media commentators should see any reason whatsoever for shying away from making personal comments on the physical appearance of old people in the public eye ...](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/fashion/mary-beard-against-internet-trolling.html?_r=0)\n\n> He picked as a running mate buttoned-up patriarchy, the lean, crop-haired, perpetually tense Mike Pence, who actually has experience in government, signing eight anti-abortion bills in his four years as governor of Indiana, and going after Planned Parenthood the way Trump went after hapless beauty queens. \n\nIn other words, she suggests that Pence is 'grabbing women by the pussy' in his own way - by taking a stance against abortion. Just for the record, I personally do not oppose abortion - but that's not really the point.\n\nWhat *is* the point is how on Earth is Solnit going to square this narrative with the election results that show that, actually, a surprising number of women voted Trump, not Clinton (why this is just automatically assumed to be 'surprising' is a fascinating question in itself).\n\nAnd it is on this question that Solnit jumps the shark ... or she would jump the shark if that shark was atop the Empire State Building ... smoking a cigar and wearing a monocle ... while playing the base guitar on its fins ... (my italics)\n\n> The Republican platform was, as usual, *keen to gut* reproductive rights and *pretty much any rights that appertained to people who weren’t straight, or male, or white.*\n\nUh-oh, here we go ...\n\n> Misogyny was everywhere. \n\n> Trump’s surrogates and key supporters constituted a sort of misogyny army ... The army included Steve Bannon, who as head of the alt-right site Breitbart News *hired Milo Yiannopoulos and helped merge the misogynistic fury of the men’s-rights movement with white supremacy and anti-Semitism to form a new cabal of far-right fury*.\n\nActually, I agree that Bannon is an asshole, but that hardly justifies the wild and paranoid accusation that \"Milo Yiannopoulos ... helped merge the misogynistic fury of the men’s-rights movement with white supremacy and anti-Semitism to form a new cabal of far-right fury\"\n\n> It seems telling that the rise of the far right and the fall of truthful news were to a meaningful extent engineered by a television network that was also a miserable one-man brothel. *But that old right-wing men are misogynists is about as surprising as that alligators bite.*\n\nWell, that isn't racist or bigoted at all. / s\n\n> ‘No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public,’ Susan B. Anthony said ... \n\nSusan B. Anthony you say? Is that the same Susan B. Anthony who said:\n\n> “You have put the ballot in the hands of your black men, thus making them political superiors of white women. Never before in the history of the world have men made former slaves the political masters of their former mistresses!”\n\nI'm not sure, but [I believe so](http://intersectionalism.tumblr.com/post/130662354761/elizabeth-cady-stanton-1815-1902-social), yes.\n\n> No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public,’ Susan B. Anthony said in 1900. ‘For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonised.’ Or as Mary Beard put it last year, ‘We have never escaped a certain male cultural desire for women’s silence.’\n\nSolnit has yet more:\n\n> One got the impression that any power a woman had was too much, and that a lot of men found women very scary [...] Trump’s slogan ‘make America great again’ seemed to invoke a return to a never-never land of white male supremacy where coal was an awesome fuel, blue-collar manufacturing jobs were what they had been in 1956, women belonged in the home, and the needs of white men were paramount.\n\n> One might argue she lost because of ... years of negative media coverage; or because of foreign intervention designed to sabotage her chances; or because of misogyny. \n\nMedia coverage like the time they showed that when she said she remembered flying into the former Yugoslavia under sniper fire ... she hadn't?\n\n> *I’ve always had the impression –from TV, movies, newspapers, sport, books, my education, my personal life, and my knowledge of who owns most things and holds government office at every level in my country – that white men get a lot of attention already.*\n\nI see.\n\n> To be a feminist you have to believe in your equality and rights, which can make your life unpleasant and dangerous if you live in a marriage, a family, a community, a church, a state that does not agree with you about this. For many women it’s safer not to have those thoughts in this country where a woman is beaten every eleven seconds or so and women’s partners are the leading cause of injury to them. And those thoughts are not so available in a country where feminism is forever being demonised and distorted. \n\nSpeaking of \"demonised and distorted\" I'm having trouble digesting quite what Solnit means by the following point:\n\n> It seems it’s also worse to vote for a racist if you’re a woman, because while white women were excoriated, white men were let off the hook (across every racial category, more men than women voted for Trump; overall 54 per cent of women supported Clinton; 53 per cent of men voted for Trump).\n\nWhat?\n\n> ... one could argue that Trump had said, incessantly, aggressively, I’m a white man, vote for me, and even that Sanders implicitly conveyed that message. \n\nCould one?!?\n\n> Many supporters fell silent or took to supporting [Clinton] in secret ...\n\nEh? What?\n\n> ‘I’ve come to believe,’ Sady Doyle wrote, ‘that, in some ways, saying nice things about Hillary Clinton is a subversive act.’\n\nWhat? Eh?\n\n> Mentioning that [Cinton had] won the popular vote *upset many of the men I am in contact with* ...\n\nNone of the women then?\n\n> ‘With their deep belief in their own special monopoly on objectivity, slightly too many men assure me that there is no misogyny in their subjective assessments or even no subjectivity and no emotion driving them, and there are no grounds for other opinions since theirs is not an opinion.’\n\nSolnit *really* fucking hates white men.\n\n> A lot of people, *particularly white men*, could not bear her, and that is as good a reason as any for Trump’s victory. ... They did not blame themselves or the electorate or the system for failing to stop Trump.\n\n**TL;DR** What's above is actually the TL;DR believe it or not - you can read the thing in its entirety [here](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n02/rebecca-solnit/from-lying-to-leering)",

    "text": "A Socialist Defense of Gender Roles Edit: wow.  I've never seen such quick downvotes.   Remember that this is supposed to be a discussion forum not an ideological purity contest.   Only downvote if you think this post has contributed nothing to the debate.   \n\nEdit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   \n\nUnusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  \n\nMRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Women must serve in army If there are more boys in your family, than girls, but in other families, for example, there are girls only,  then why your children should serve and be cannon fodder, what is their guilty? The fact that they were born the wrong gender? Have you invested in them less effort, money and love, than parents of girls? Think about your children's children, as if they, too, will be boys? If, in some countries, for women quotas are introduced in parliament, then they should have quotas in squads involved in a military combat. Why do men agree to be lower than women, has it been been seen in the history, that the man should have fewer rights and more responsibilities? It used to be quite the opposite, for example,the penalty for killing a woman was twice less than for killing a men. If some men think that women are  more important than them, then they should serve in the army in the first place.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is believed, that in the past, women were the property of men. Property can not fight, so in those days women didn't serve in the army. Today, men and women have equal rights - and rightly so, and therefore the man should no longer protect women as their property, and the woman should protect herself as a complete person equal to man. Actively fought women of such nations as the Celts and Sarmatians, the Scythians, the Nordic Valkyries also did not arise out of nowhere. And Cimmerian, from whom came the Slavs, their woman could not marry until they bring the enemy's head. But the women who fought,  had the same rights, so in the history there always has been a direct link between the military duty of citizens and civil rights.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course, not every country has the military conflict, but there are countries where such conflicts may arise. Even in calm countries where forced recruitment is not planned, there are still discriminatory laws, giving privileges to women in recruitment matters. The question arises - why do they exist? Yes, then, that in emergency situations to make man meat. And if you, gentlemans, don't want to become meat, you need to protect your rights today, and not when it is too late, and there will be no time to change something. In the wild nature, for example, in most species, males and females live equally and have equal rights, responsibilities and survival, and the distribution of people like cattle, when most males go for slaughter - is manifestly fascist.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nImagine if in an army served only women, do you think they would have suffered, or demanded equal rights and responsibilities with men? The worst thing is not that men are discriminated and are forced to become meat on the basis of sex, but that they do not even require the equal treatment of both sexes. They do not realize that childbirth is just a job, which is much easier and safer than, for example, the work of a miner, and for the work no one should receive an exemption from the military service or any special privileges other than monetary rewards. Yes, childbirth, sometimes is painful, but no one is exempted from military service, from those who have passed, for example, through a painful reception at the dentist. After all, the main burden of child raising are, again, in the men. While women work for childcare is usually not as hard. But most men are working hard, earning money for the children. Do not forget, that women who do not have children, or are infertile, or even those who claim that they did not ever think about childbirth - childfree - also dont have to serve in the army. Is that normal?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven if we imagine, that discrimination on basis of sex may be economically beneficial to the country, as, for example, once, slavery was profitable, it does not mean that such discrimination is permitted. Neither slavery nor conscription of men to the army, in the absence of conscription for women can not be justified by any economic or demographic benefits, because above all this, there are human rights. In addition, conscription of women equally with men, most likely, will improve the country's economic and demographic indicators. Therefore, any rights of men must be greatly expanded, and we are not talking about the benefits of plots or free transport tickets, or women should be deprived of many rights and are endowed with additional responsibilities, for example, with army tax, or women should be drafted into the army.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe scale of the threat to Israel, North Korea or Norway is not as great as for our country, but even there, women are encouraged to join the army. In Georgia, too, there was introduced a bill on compulsory military service for women. In some places such practice has already been applied, that men and women live in the same barracks, and are washed in the same bath, so there is no need for additional infrastructure for a women conscription. Naturally, the appeal of women should not be sham, as it happens in some armies of the world, when they only shift the papers, and then receive military pensions and apartments, and a woman should be fully participating in the military combat.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWomen are conscripted into the Kurdish militia, where they account for 30% of participants, and after a month's course of study their effectiveness is not inferior to men in battle. According to the latest research and the experience of fitness trainers, muscles of women often grow even faster than that of men, and, as a result of physical activity during pregnancy, childbirth, then, passes even better. The reproductive cycle of women, although it may be suffering from stress, but even women who passed the concentration camps or the Second World War combats, in the majority, then successfully gave birth. It is believed also that psychologically women are more stable and more executive than men.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen women are deprived of their duty to marry and have children, then men are not deprived of their duty to serve in the army. Women did very tricky - they have equal rights, but forgot about equal responsibilities. We must understand that equal rights mean equal responsibilities. It is because responsibilities restrict rights, and thus make them unequal. Society should not be considered as two separate gender or sex. Society is one unit, and if some people can give birth, it does not mean that they should have more rights and fewer responsibilities than those who can not. If women take equal part in the elections, so they influence to the policy of the state, then they must carry equal responsibility on the battlefield, if this policy, for example, led to war. Just because of the equal rights and opportunities for women leaving abroad, demographics is suffering, but equal rights is correct, only with equal responsibilities and therefore men and women have on an equal basis to serve in the army.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is unclear why the men are compulsory drafted, but not women. After all, there are enough man volunteers and contract military serving in the army. It means that the male half of the population does so much more to the Army than women. Therefore, primarily woman should be compulsory drafted. Some say that the women compulsory conscription will not make life of men better, and therefore it is not necessary, but it's just not the case. If, for example, all women wold be extempted from taxation, then perhaps it would be positive discrimination? It is quite obvious that it would be a negative discrimination in relation to men, and therefore, regardless of whether this will be better for life of a men, or not, but women should be recruited into the army.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLack of conscription or military draft for women is not positive discrimination, because those men who serve in the place of women are discriminated. If, for example, some citizens are physically stronger or better able to fight, it does not mean that they should forcibly, for free, to work in mines for those citizens, who are physically weaker, or die for them on the battlefield. Stronger citizens are not worse than the weaker, and all citizens are equal under the constitution. Some people say that the conscription of women into an army is hate of woman. So, if some citizens say that only man should be conscripted into an army - isn't it hate of men? Why women do not serve even the alternative community service?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo not affect a demography, it is possible to conscript women after 30 years old for active participation in military combat, and the father of their children can stay at home for childcare, and the children can be fed with a special child food. It is sufficient to note that many women do not breastfeed, so their breast doesn't not lose shape. Demographics can be encouraged by the fact, that women who have not given birth to two children under 25 years, can be conscripted to participate in military combat, not at 30 years old, but at 25. By the way, father's right to education of the child should be the same as mother's, because the genetic code of a child is by half father's. And younger woman can be consсrited to protect the safer parts of the front, as well as for logistics and engineering. In case of pregnancy, if women is conscripted for the year, then she would be able to serve the major part of military service before childbirth.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTo prevent pregnancy, women can set special intrauterine device , use of oral contraceptives. and in case of failure - the woman herself is responsible, and her pregnancy is regarded as a negligent attitude to military service, and shall be punished by imprisonment accordingly. However, if a pregnant woman can continue to perform combat missions, the punishment for her can be canceled. There are examples of women who engaged in kickboxing at nines month of pregnancy, and it didn't not harm the baby. The combat vest can be replaced by larger, because the soldiers who have additional weight and have belly can serve too, and special combat jackets for pregnant women could be bought. In the case of the death of a pregnant soldier, the number of population of the country may suffer a bit, but in the peacetime women use contraception and make millions of abortions, and they do not see any problems with it.",

    "text": "How can I get out of retail hell? I'm a 26 year old woman. I turn 27 in May. I graduated in 2013, with a BA in Political Science. When I first started college, I thought I wanted to go to law school. But after taking a few law-specific classes, I realized that I wasn't really interested in law. Then, I realized that I really liked international politics, international relations etc. I took the GRE, but my GPA is just dismal (2.75). No grad school is going to accept that, and I wan't too sure about going to grad school anyway.\n\nAbout 8 months later, I got a job as a substitute teacher. I worked a few assignments, but wasn't getting as many. But I thought I'd give actual teaching a try, so I enrolled in an alternative certification program, and in October, I started working at Ross Dress for Less in October of 2014. I was still enrolled in the program, until August of 2015. I got a full time teaching job. In an alternative certification program, you have to teach for a full school year, as a teacher, before you become fully certified. So I thought I'd teach for a year here, get certified, then I would do what I *really* wanted to do; which is teaching English abroad.\n\nBut when I started teaching, it was a terrible experience. It was so bad that I started having panic attacks, was diagnosed with anxiety, missed two weeks of school because I was so sick, and resigned in October. My therapist had advised me to not start looking for a job until December of 2015. So I started applying in 2016 and I got a job at Sears and I've been working there ever since.\n\nI've been applying for other jobs that aren't retail. I've been , relentlessly, applying to teach abroad, but nothing is working. I still live with my parents and I desperately want to get a better job and move out. It just seems like I'm going nowhere, no matter how hard I try. It just feels hopeless, and what's worse is that I just don't know what I want to do.\n\nOn top of that, I've been having some medical issues (that are finally resolved), but I just feel like whatever I do, anxiety is going to creep in and I won't be able to handle it. But I hate this job so much! And even worse, I feel like I'm running out of time since I'm almost 27, living with my parents, with a degree, and working a retail job.",

    "text": "My friend and I applied for Walmart So last week me and a friend both applied for our local Wal-Mart, and luckily both of us received a call, and we both now have a job offer. But here's where things get a bit messed up. During high school, he was a person who kind of half-cared. He made it through, but with some major setbacks because of his unwillingness to do the work. I on the other hand took college courses exclusively during our senior year. I finished them with good grades, and now already have college started. During his interview, he was asked about schooling and told them his plans. They then changed his schedule to meet his needs. When I went in for my interview a couple days later, I was never even given an opportunity to tell the woman interviewing me my plans for college. My friend was given a position where he maintains the meat section, keeping the most out of date meat in the front, and unpackaging boxes of meat and placing them in the store floor. He said that he was told there is a minor health risk so he gets paid a bit extra, which I can understand. He got a schedule from 8 am to 5 pm, which is pretty much what I was hoping I too would get. But that's not the case. I was offered a position in which I unload the delivery truck, sort the merchandise, bring out merchandise onto the store floor, and stock the shelves. My position is actually harder than his, and on top of that, I was given a 2pm to 11pm schedule, which is almost exactly what I DIDN'T want. But after all of this I didn't really care. I said oh well, I'm getting paid, so that's all that matters. But then I found out that not only am I doing more than my friend with a schedule I don't like, but I'm getting paid $1.95/hour LESS than him!\n\nWhat do I do? Should I look for a better job? We only work 4 days a week, but he makes over $70 MORE per week for doing less work. Had I not known he makes more than me, I would honestly have been happy with my pay-rate, but I KNOW that he's making more than me. It frustrates me so much that someone who half-a**ed their work up to this point got the better job, and then there's me. I have never gotten a grade below a C in my life, and the only C I have ever gotten was from a drama class because I wasn't a very good actor and the teacher picked favorites (I was not one of them). I honestly don't know what to do. I'm supposed to fill out the Wal-Mart background check today so that I can begin orientation at the end of the week, but now I'm not sure.\n\nWhat would you recommend?\n\n\nEDIT: Because I get asked this a lot, I do NOT live in LA, it's just a name I made up a long time ago when I was into LA Noire",

    "text": "Looking to start a career in robotics - did not get my degree in science - Help Okay, I'm having a hard time editing my whole spiel on this - because I feel like all of it is important info to reach out for help. I'm probably wrong... but bear with me if you can. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nMy whole life I have wanted to work in the field of science, but I have never had the self confidence to believe I could do it.\n\n\n&nbsp; \n\n\n**I just want to know the initial steps to driving my career this way.** I have not received my degree in engineering, and I've been in the workforce for about 3 years - none of my jobs relating to what I want to do. (*Except for MAYBE when I was a \"product designer\" for Leapfrog*)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nIdeally I would love to leave my job for some sort of entry level position at a job related to **robotics**. Right now I am working long and inconsistent hours, its making it hard to properly schedule my free time to move in the right direction. I would just do volunteer lab work - but given my lack of spare time I haven't been able to find something that works, while I still can pay for things like rent and food. I would love to just leave my job for a full time entry level position in a lab environment, something like a research assistant... but perhaps wouldn't require a degree? Does that even exist?\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy interests lie in two realms of this field - one pertaining to creating “artificial bodies” and one to creating “artificial minds”.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nStarting with the first; I feel the best fit would be seeking out a career in mechanical engineering. I’ve worked with “making things” my entire life to know that it's something I enjoy thoroughly and could do for a lifetime. I attended Cooper Union - which is an especially technical school; the quality of something we crafted / built was heavily stressed. I've learned to create a \"product\" from various materials, and I’m confident that I possess the grounding skills in design, physics, and construction; that would give me a solid base to grow from when acquiring the technical knowledge of machine making. I'm trying to find affordable mechanical engineering classes... but again - with my current job situation - it's hard to find something that will work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nMy other career interest pertains to skills that are more foreign to me, (which, ironically, makes me want to pursue it more) developing AI. The appeal of this field for me stems from my ongoing interest in cognitive science. During my education, these were the classes that I was very successful in, and enjoyed the most. My teachers really appreciated the projects I would present, and I was fully absorbed and involved. Though I wouldn't say I’m an expert in this area - I wouldn't say I’m a layman either. What I am lacking in is a background in computer science. Though I dedicate most of my spare time to educating myself; tinkering with basic configurations, and reading up on various subjects pertaining to it - I’m looking into taking my technical knowledge to the next level by taking classes geared towards this field. I want to turn the energy from my interest in cognitive science into fabrication, I want to learn how to materialize the thing I’ve only been able to learn about on paper and see in nature, like the mind and consciousness. So these would be the fields that would be more geared towards becoming an algorithm specialist / computer scientist of sorts. Right now I am taking some online courses... but obviously would need to do more to actually dive into this field.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n**Ideally** - I would want to find something where I could be involved in the production of both these facets… but I don't know if a career like that exists.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n**Creation of a product is the essential goal**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n*I do have a driving force behind this passion that I know is unrealistic but could maybe help contextualize what / why I want to do with my life ( in a diluted way)*\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor the past couple of years, I've experienced this recurring dream :\n \n&nbsp;\n\n>In my old age, I have created the first “true” AI, that manifests itself as a small childlike robot - thus initiating the onset of the technological singularity. I am being interviewed by a woman while holding the robot in my lap. She asks if I have any regrets, and mentions that I have given up finding love, starting a family, and other things of that nature. I well up and tell her that though at the time it might not have seemed beneficial to go through those pains and hardships, finally creating this machine was my purpose and I live with no regret. I feel an overwhelming amount of happiness -- and then I wake up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nThough this is obviously fantastical; this \"dream\" encapsulates what drives my passion for this field. It might make me seem melodramatic (or even make me look like a loon) but I am willing to take any steps - to start making moves towards this career...as long as they are moving me toward the right direction. I just feel like I'm golfing in the pitch black right now... I just want to be able to at the very least see the direction I should be swinging - no matter how far away the hole is. lol god sorry for these corny things i just don't know how to describe myself\n\n&nbsp;\n\n \nI would be immensely grateful for anyone that would be willing to guide me!!",

    "text": "Advice? Job doesn't satisfy me anymore, should I quit? Long story incoming, I'll try to do a TL;DR at the end, but I can't assure anything.\n\nSeven months ago I was called to work at a toy store (my boss buys containers to Toys R' Us and basically my job is to test the toys and others and give the ok to sell those products). At the next day, June 15th, I started to work in this job. At that time I was on the classical honeymoon. Nice work, nice work hours and nice companions. \n\nThen, the guy that was my companion was sent to the principal office. So I started to work with my boss' brother. He is such a guy. I was made this branch office's boss so  I took the important decisions while consulting with my boss. I was getting more responsabilities and I could do that so I stayed happy with that. \n\nTwo months after that my boss opens the fourth branch office in another city, so his brother takes that office as his own. I recommended a friend and we performed well but my boss didn't think that way. My boss hands his wife the \"personal\" issues like contracts and salaries and others. \n\nThen he puts cameras that are watching me the 11 hours I spent in my job. As I'm kind of introvert dude I give the customer his space and then I go and speak with them. Boss' wife don't like that way. She calls me and tells me: \"OP, you are not caring for the customer. You only say hello and don't do additional things. If we don't sell, how can you expect we pay your salary?\" I try to give my point of view but she says \"No, you are not allowed to say anything. I've been watching you through the cameras many days in a row\". At that moment I didn't knew that that shit is illegal.\n\nThen my boss fires my friend and hires his sister-in-law. She portrays the first days the self-image of a caring woman but nope.avi, she is a manipulative woman who bullies me to the point I've reconsidered suicide (which I had haven't thought in a while).\n\n16/12 she gets and talks me almost yelling me, and forces me to yell her. I don't follow her game but when she talks to me again she tells me that I'm a bad guy and I mistreat her and bullshit aside. I said: \"This is a thing I want to say just once, you are like the guys who bullied me in highschool\". Then she starts to shout at me that she was recording the things that I was saying and she will send it to his brother-in-law (my boss). She doesn't chill out and keeps yelling at me. I collapse, started to cry and run away. I told my boss that I want to quit because of her and he tells me that I should not react like that. That I'm an adult and he should not care about this situation because he is the boss.\n\nHe then tells me that I'm not a cooperative worker and his SIL starts to victimize herself, that I almost treated her like the worst person in life. I received a warning because of my \"run away\" even though what I did was \"run away\" in my lunch hours. After that my boss' wife sends me another warning because of \"I wasn't working like my contract said\" even when my boss told me that I could do that, but he said he didn't told me shit.\n\nSo I've been thinking in quit, but I get paid like 500 USD for my job (in Chilean pesos). What do you think, Reddit? Should I quit?\n\nTL;DR: Job was amazing, but the conditions changed a lot in the next months since I was contracted and the girl who I work now is a manipulative one and I'm not that happy with my actual laboral conditions, but my salary is high compaired with anothers and I'ven't found a job in my profession (teacher).\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "I was a victim of abuse and the only one who didn't know it. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind words and for sharing your stories. I encourage those above all else! I love reading your personal opinions and your experiences and I'm sure many others do as well. I try to reply to as many comments as possible and I will continue to do so. I cannot express how thankful I am for the support I found in this sub and I hope others will as well!\nAlso: Thank you to micktorious for the gild <3\n--------------------------------------------\n\nI grew up in almost every area you could find a Marine Corps or Navy base, Honolulu, Philadelphia, San Diego you name it; I've been there for at least a month. When my father was finally deployed to Afghanistan my mother and I moved back to her home town of Hueytown, AL to live with my grandparents. My mom, being a college drop out, worked most nights as a server while my grandmother entertained me. Life was different but for me it was all I knew. My dad eventually returned and retired so I thought my life would be normal but nearly 11 years later I find myself living in a world of constant fear and embarrassment far from the normalcy that most children cherished.\n\nWe'll call my mom Joan for anonymity.\n\nJoan had a nasty habit of alcoholism, she drank till she was buzzed nearly every night. When my paternal grandfather would watch me my mother would stay out till 3 or 4 in the morning while he awaited her arrival so he could go home. Joan would arrive smelling like her nights festivities and after changing she would simply tell my grandfather,\"You can leave now.\"\n\nThis behavior never changed, especially after the divorce. Joan would often leave me at home with no food or way to get any when I was only 10, not answering her phone or messaging me for days on end. She would even throw extravagant parties which she told me I was not allowed to attend. I would be forced upstairs and not allowed to come down for any reason except to clean her mess or let the dog outside.\nAs I got older, my mothers antics became more severe. She would tell me I was worthless, that I would never accomplish anything, no one would ever want to marry me and that I would end up on the street. I often ignored the comments, parents sometimes say things they couldn't possibly mean, right? \nThe problem with verbal volatility towards anyone is that they develop a fight or flight reaction if you do it enough, similar to being bullied. You either fight for yourself or run, and I chose wrong.\nI began fighting back, telling her she never even finished college so who was she to tell me I was a failure? She failed classes in middle school and I was an all A student. The comments turned to screaming, the screaming became frantic and frantic emotions lead to frantic actions. I showed up to school covered in bruises, being a sporty child everyone just assumed it was just a rough soccer game or I fell in dance. My dad ignored them, he told me she was my mother and the comments were just \"who she was.\"\nI remember when she pushed me down the stairs, she stood above me, *laughing*. Warm tears rolled down my face, it was just who she was.\n\nWhen I was 12 my dad took me to see a psychologist, we'll call her Anne. Anne was a specialist in child psychology, dealing with children of divorced parents. I saw Anne every 2 weeks for several years, but it wasn't until our 5th session that Anne asked me a question that changed my life forever.\nTears welled in my eyes in horror, even now I can't type the words without feeling them run down my face. Anne asked me if I had ever heard of child abuse or knew what it was.\nAt that moment I realized, everyone knew *except me*.\n\nI was a victim of abuse and the only one who didn't know it.\n\nEver since I left her when I was 13 I've had dance teachers,  old friends, ex-friends of my mother and even my own dad tell me they saw how she treated me. But why didn't I? I was so concerned with keeping my life as normal as possible that I ignored every comment, every hit and every lonely night. More importantly, why did everyone ignore it too?\nWhy did my maternal grandparents gloss over my concerns for her behavior, why did my dad ignore them as well? Why did my own school counselor call Child Services because she thought I was suicidal but never decided to investigate my horrible relationships with female teachers? Or my fear of being touched?\n\nI still don't know... and it haunts me.\n\nNow, nearly 20 years old, my friends call me a survivor of childhood abuse, but I'm not sure if you can call this surviving. Any time a female authority figure yells at me, I have to get up and leave immediately. I burst into tears, which is extremely uncharacteristic of me, I shake and struggle to breathe. I hear the echoes of Joan, telling me to shut up, to stop crying for attention. Sometimes I hear them in my dreams and wake up to my roommate or my boyfriend giving me my medicine to calm me down.\nSometimes I smell her perfume, hear her favorite song or see someone with her poorly permed hair. My heart stops, for a second I'm back in my room, my mother pounding on my door and screaming to let her in, I'm just as scared and useless until a friend asks me what's wrong.\n\nI shake my head, smile and tell a joke.\nBecause that's all I can do.\n\nSometimes I hop on Facebook and unblock Joan, see what she's doing. Usually the same thing, going to football games, partying, vacationing with money she doesn't have.\nThings my father and I can't afford to do.\nI wonder if she regrets anything that happened, I wonder if she even knows what she did.\nI'll never know, more importantly I don't want to. But what I do know is this entire ordeal set off a passion in me that no other sport, subject or speech ever has.\n\nChoosing a major in college was easy, I knew I wanted to help people like myself, if at least to help them with the after math. Psychology was my top scoring job on any personality test I took in school but I had already decided it was my calling. I decided I would bring awareness, before I left my High School, I worked to help women and children of domestic abuse, I set up several peer counseling groups as well as a club for people who wanted to help. I educated teachers in my school on the signs of child abuse and how to help children without breaking any laws or stepping on any toes. I left knowing I made that school a bit safer for people like me then when I came.\nI hope that I can continue this into a long and healthy career as a Psychologist specializing in PTSD, depression and anxiety disorders while raising my own children in the best possible environment, giving them everything I never had; a real mother who only cares for them, a woman who exerts authority in her tone, not her insults and a parent who uplifts her children rather than dragging them down.\n\nI hope to show people the one of the many faces behind childhood abuse, to make feel them a bit less alone.\nMost importantly I hope to be a role model to other girls, and even other women, of the strength behind the suffering and the bright future past the dark present.\n\n*Semper fortis, semper fidelis.* Always strong, always faithful.",

    "text": "Thank you for raising beautiful daughters - Father's perspective. I want to thank the amazing woman who raised two beautiful daughters.  \n\nThis happened yesterday while my wife, my 2 year old daughter and I were at LegoLand Discovery just north of Toronto.  The mall was packed as it was Family Day so all the families were there shopping just as we were.  My toddler is tall for her age so she was allowed entry to play in the indoor jungle gym.  She was having an amazing time and my wife and I were so happy for her as we try to let her experiment and try new things, until she reached a point where she was stuck. She was stuck on a platform that she couldn't get down from as her feet didn't quite touch the ground and she was scared of falling - understandably so nor could she go back up because it was too high.  The nice attendant asked if we wanted to go get her because she was doing that cry that isn't really a cry but more of a cry for help and my wife and I decided to say \"no.\" We wanted to encourage her to make the \"leap\" (maybe 6 inches) onto the platform.  This is where your daughters came in.  They were about 5-6 years old and started to cheer on my daughter. When other children were just going around my daughter they were saying \"you can do it, look at mommy and daddy. They think you can do it\" and with a little bit of help, she was able to put her feet on the platform.  We were both so happy for my daughter, as was she.  Your daughters didn't stop there.  They held her hand through other parts of the gym that my daughter couldn't get to on her own. My daughter followed your kids through tubes, rope ladders and slides which she never would have done on her own.  The expression on her face makes me smile just typing it.  When it was time to leave, my daughter looked up to your 2 girls with a smile bright enough to light up a room and said \"tank you\" and our hearts just melt.  We wanted to thank you ourselves but when I did, it was kind of awkward and creepy. Like here is this grown man thanking me for my daughters helping his daughter, kind of thing.  I wish there was a way to express my gratitude to you now so here's my best attempt:\n\nThank you for giving my wife and I hope that there are children who were raised to help others and do the right thing.  That your daughters will be there to comfort and console the girl being bullied in high school.  That you instilled a sense of \"treat others the way you want to be treated\" in them. That they saw my little girl and felt that being her friend was better than her being alone. I sincerely hope your daughters grow up to do amazing things because this world needs people like them to lead us places that we are too scared to go on our own; to go down the scary \"tube\" or climb the tall \"rope ladder\"; to lend a hand and a voice of encouragement when someone's afraid of falling; to make someone smile instead of crying because they said \"you can do it\" instead of \"do it on your own.\"\n\nI like think my wife and I are good parents, but I will strive to be the kind of parent you are.  You are a great parent and teacher to your daughters.  From our melted hearts to you...Thank You.",

    "text": "What can my mom do? Alright Reddit.. I've had several throwaways and small accounts, but I've never actually posted before. I'm really banking on some helpful advice here. \n\nMy mom graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, but she stayed home with my siblings and I while we were really young. When we were kids, she went back to school to obtain a Master's Degree in Science Education, and she started teaching high school Chemistry. She taught at her first school for a few years, but her contract wasn't renewed because she had run afoul of the head principal (not giving school board member's children grades they didn't deserve, not passing star athletes who didn't put in the work, and disciplining a girl for acting belligerent and skipping class, who in turn went to said principal and accused my mother of being racist and only disliking her because she was African American). \n\nShe found a new job for the next school year at a smaller school district teaching Advanced Biology and Environmental Science, and even though it was a smaller school (the previous high school had been a huge intercity school) her salary went up by about 10k per year. She taught there for 1 full year, and is in her second year at this high school. \n\nHowever, yesterday she was told that because the school can't pass a levy (it's a very small blue collar area who doesn't value education too much) her and a few other newer teachers are being let go and absorbed for the following year. She is still getting payed through the summer, and she's going to finish up the year, but she won't have a job after that. \n\nWe're not going to be without an income as my dad is a police officer and I'm moving out of my parents house when college is finished, but my question is what are her options? \n\nShe put so much into teaching and loves making a difference in her kids' lives, and she's a very good teacher. She's just tired of looking for a new job every couple of years, and anyone who is a teacher knows how hard jobs are to come by. She is a very smart woman, but she doesn't know what else she can do besides teaching. \n\nIs there any type of profession that those degrees can matter in besides teaching? I'm not sure what else to ask but if you guys could take a second and give whatever advice you have, no matter how small. I just want my mom to be happy and I feel bad that she keeps getting screwed by the education system. \n\nI appreciate everything you guys have to offer.",

    "text": "UK based student..How do I become a History teacher in Florida? Hey everyone!\n\nI feel I have reached a stalemate in my life and would much appreciate some advice for the situation that I find myself in....\n\nI am 24 year old woman from Cambridge,UK, who has a BA(Hons) degree in History and am just about to complete my Masters in Museum Studies. After giving things some serious thought and consideration, I have decided that I would very much like to be a History teacher however, a History teacher in Florida.\n\nI am fully aware that this goal as a whole is somewhat ambitious seeing as I have no connection to the US whatsoever - e.g a US passport/citizenship - and I understand completely that it is not something that will be easily achieved. I know it will take time, patience and a lot of hard work but, I am determined! Firstly, I have some volunteer experience of working within a secondary school so I am aware of what exactly working within this particular environment entails in terms of teaching expectations, learning/engagement techniques and so on and feel this really is the career path for me.\n\nI have done some basic research on the various routes in which I can become a teacher in the UK and I understand that I would have to be fully accredited here before I could even consider the US. However after that, I reach a point where my mind becomes overwhelmed with what I would need to do to become a teacher in Florida. I have spoken to my career advisers/researched online and there doesn't seem to be a clear-cut guide anywhere on how to achieve this goal.\n\nI obviously know that I would have to take the various/necessary steps to apply for a Green Card and that I would have to take the FTCE to become accredited to teach in Florida however, I feel that there is just so much information out there that I have no clue where to start. I honestly sit for hours trying to make sense of things e.g what test I would need to take/what form to fill in and just feel bogged down in so much information that it sometimes makes me think why am I stressing myself out so much and then at my lowest point, something tells me to give up. I then get myself back on track by thinking of the bigger picture and on I go again.\n\nOn a side note, I was also thinking of trying to bag myself some work experience at a middle/high school on an American Airbase here in the UK in order to assist with my understanding of the school system in America. Would this help in anyway?\n\nThank you for reading guys and as I said, any advice would be much appreciated.",

    "text": "Please tell me if hotell conference/reception is at least decent? (sweden) Hello. I'm 22 years old and this is my first course that im likely to actually finish and get a degree.\n\nIve spent a lot of time figuring out what id like to do.\nThe hardest part about it was having to figure it out myself. Isnt it ducking stupid that we have to choose it so quickly, sometimes resulting in us wasting a couple years?\n\nI've moved to Sweden about six years ago. I went to the language introduction school and finished it with a degree in swedish. At that time i was 19 and although my swedish was good enough to be able to hold a fluent conversation with let's say a cashier, I'd still have huge problems reading documents/newspapers and i think that stopped me from pursuing the usual college->university path.\n\nI've settled on a 1 year carpentry course thinking I'd be fine but boy was I wrong. There was no sitting in class. If the teacher had to explain something about the specifics of a certain type of wood or a machine, id be absolutely shocked at the amount of words i simply didn't understand. I didn't know the simpliest things like 'cut', 'board', 'saw' so when it came to more complicated things it was a huge turnoff. I also have a snapback and I realized how hard it would be to work as a carpenter when my head and chest just uncontrollably leans forward. And that was the end of my career as a carpenter.\n\nI'm now in a hotel conference/reception course hoping to find a job behind a desk. Ive also gotten to know a really nice woman who has contacts in the most amazing place I could ever work at as a receptionist, the Turning Torso, the biggest apartment building in Europe, located in the western port, where the architecture just makes it a dream place (mirrors edge style for reference). \n\nThis is really not my dream job, I'd really like to become something more, an astrophysicist for example, but I've decided to settle on that goal later once im at least a little established. Now I need to have a decent job that id enjoy or that I at least wouldnt hate. I live with my dad, he pays 10k SEK (which is way over the average rent) for a ducking basement and I ducking hate it with my whole self. I hold my tears everytime i see those huge spiders on the walls in my room. I try not to think about it but I'm already 22 and I cant really bring anyone home nor have a girlfriend because id never get through saying that I cant invite them home. \n\nCan you please tell me if being a hotel receptionist brings some decent money and if I can hope to become someone after working in this industry for years? My teacher keeps telling me that I shouldve looked to become someone esle than what im studying for right now (yeah i know, good thing for a teacher to say) but i think that with my 4 languages, good maths and computers It's just the right choice.",

    "text": "Would a career in nursing, accounting or computer science suit me better? Hi r/careerguidance,\n\nI'm 26 and graduated with a BA in Geography and Environmental Studies in 2014. I've been struggling with a lack of direction and general indecisiveness ever since. \n\nI currently am a consultant at an oil and gas company doing \n a mixture of HSE / document control / admin type work. The lack of stability is making me extremely unhappy. I find myself wishing I had an established career like my friends who are teachers, social workers, nurses, etc. (I know I shouldn't compare myself but this is easier said than done). I'm constantly worried about being 55 and working entry-level retail for minimum wage due to my lack of concrete skills and poor choice of a degree. \n\nI think I've narrowed my choices down to three careers, but am having a difficult time deciding on which one would be the best fit. I've narrowed down my core values in a career to:\n\n1. Stability\n2. In demand (how nice it would be to not have to send 100's of resumes out and hear nothing back)\n3. ~$60,000 or >\n4. Not *extremely* stressful  \n\nI've put together a simplified list of pros and cons (based on my personality, requirements and geographical location) for each position below:\n\n**NURSING**\n\n*Pros:*\n\n* Helping people\n\n* Interest in biology, diseases, etc.\n* Entry level pay: ~$34/hr ($68,000)\n* In demand\n* Can move anywhere and can find job\n* Stability (unionized)\n* Flexibility (can work part time, casual, etc.)\n* Many different subfields within nursing\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Constantly being around people (introvert)\n* Poop\n* Stressful (some positions)\n* Potentially 4 years of schooling; accelerated programs very competitive\n\n\n**ACCOUNTING**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Working independently (to an extent)\n* Entry level pay: ~50,000/yr\n* Once CPA, in demand\n* Stability\n\n*Cons*\n\n* monotonous\n* sitting all day\n* Entry level positions over saturated\n* Stress\n* 3ish years to get BBA + CPA courses\n\n\n**PROGRAMMER / COMPUTER SCIENCE FIELD**\n\n*Pros*\n\n* Working independently (to an extent)\n* Entry level pay: varies (~50,000?)\n* In demand\n* Enjoy coding and making websites\n\n*Cons*\n\n* Sitting all day\n* Being a woman in a male dominated industry\n* Advanced math..

    "text": "Karen Straughan's response to \"those aren't real feminists\" *The following is a very informed and highly reusable  comment by Karen Straughan in response to a feminist who thinks the many blatant sexists among feminists aren't real feminists:* \n\n\n\nSo what you're saying is that you, a commenter using a username on an internet forum are the true feminist, and the feminists actually responsible for changing the laws, writing the academic theory, teaching the courses, influencing the public policies, and the massive, well-funded feminist organizations with thousands and thousands of members all of whom call themselves feminists... they are not \"real feminists\".\n\nThat's not just \"no true Scotsman\". That's delusional self deception.\n\nListen, if you want to call yourself a feminist, I don't care. I've been investigating feminism for more than 9 years now, and people like you used to piss me off, because to my mind all you were doing was providing cover and ballast for the powerful political and academic feminists you claim are just jerks. And believe me, they ARE jerks. If you knew half of what I know about the things they've done under the banner of feminism, maybe you'd stop calling yourself one.\n\nBut I want you to know. You don't matter. You're not the director of the Feminist Majority Foundation and editor of Ms. Magazine, Katherine Spillar, who said of domestic violence: \"Well, that's just a clean-up word for wife-beating,\" and went on to add that regarding male victims of dating violence, \"we know it's not girls beating up boys, it's boys beating up girls.\"\n\nYou're not Jan Reimer, former mayor of Edmonton and long-time head of Alberta's Network of Women's Shelters, who just a few years ago refused to appear on a TV program discussing male victims of domestic violence, because for her to even show up and discuss it would lend legitimacy to the idea that they exist.\n\nYou're not Mary P Koss, who describes male victims of female rapists in her academic papers as being not rape victims because they were \"ambivalent about their sexual desires\" (if you don't know what that means, it's that they actually wanted it), and then went on to define them out of the definition of rape in the CDC's research because it's inappropriate to consider what happened to them rape.\n\nYou're not the National Organization for Women, and its associated legal foundations, who lobbied to replace the gender neutral federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act of 1984 with the obscenely gendered Violence Against Women Act of 1994. The passing of that law cut male victims out of support services and legal assistance in more than 60 passages, just because they were male.\n\nYou're not the Florida chapter of the NOW, who successfully lobbied to have Governor Rick Scott veto not one, but two alimony reform bills in the last ten years, bills that had passed both houses with overwhelming bipartisan support, and were supported by more than 70% of the electorate.\n\nYou're not the feminist group in Maryland who convinced every female member of the House on both sides of the aisle to walk off the floor when a shared parenting bill came up for a vote, meaning the quorum could not be met and the bill died then and there.\n\nYou're not the feminists in Canada agitating to remove sexual assault from the normal criminal courts, into quasi-criminal courts of equity where the burden of proof would be lowered, the defendant could be compelled to testify, discovery would go both ways, and defendants would not be entitled to a public defender.\n\nYou're not Professor Elizabeth Sheehy, who wrote a book advocating that women not only have the right to murder their husbands without fear of prosecution if they make a claim of abuse, but that they have the moral responsibility to murder their husbands.\n\nYou're not the feminist legal scholars and advocates who successfully changed rape laws such that a woman's history of making multiple false allegations of rape can be excluded from evidence at trial because it's \"part of her sexual history.\"\n\nYou're not the feminists who splattered the media with the false claim that putting your penis in a passed-out woman's mouth is \"not a crime\" in Oklahoma, because the prosecutor was incompetent and charged the defendant under an inappropriate statute (forcible sodomy) and the higher court refused to expand the definition of that statute beyond its intended scope when there was already a perfectly good one (sexual battery) already there. You're not the idiot feminists lying to the public and potentially putting women in Oklahoma at risk by telling potential offenders there's a \"legal\" way to rape them.\n\nAnd you're none of the hundreds or thousands of feminist scholars, writers, thinkers, researchers, teachers and philosophers who constructed and propagate the body of bunkum theories upon which all of these atrocities are based.\n\nYou're the true feminist.

    "text": "A point of irritation about this sub What's the deal with the most frivolous posts making it to R/all?   \n\nEveryday I read this sub and find horrifying examples of institutional discrimination against men and boys.   I find brilliantly written deconstructions of feminist theory.   I find brilliant lectures by figures like Karen Straughan.   I find rare but inspiring stories of men overcoming the odds in a gynocentric society.   \n\nYet it seems like every post that makes it to R/all involves some low effort shit post about feminism or some relatively trivial matter like women hogging seats with their bags on the subway or men having to pay on dates.   I'm not saying such posts should be banned, obviously, I just find it odd that they consistently end up at the top of the heap.   It gives the impression that the MRM is itself a trivial affair made up of whiners with no real concerns.   \n\nAnother type of post that commonly makes it to R/all is \"hot teacher bangs 17-year-old boy.\"   It that behavior wrong?   Yes (since she has institutional power over him).   But it hardly compares to posts I've seen here about women molesting, torturing and killing little boys only to be given a slap on the wrist.   I remember one post about a huge fat woman who molested three pre-pubescent boys in a trailer park over a period of several years and was given probation.   I remember another where a group of women in some quasi-cult locked their boys in cages, skinned them alive and forced them to eat their own flesh; the women were given a few years in prison.  That's an extreme example but you get my point.  \n\nAnd then there's the academic stuff.   There are fascinating studies posted here on a regular basis that effectively refute feminism.   Examples would include [studies on in-group bias](https://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/2004/041213.Goodwin.gender.html), scholarly papers on [female forms of power](http://www.jstor.org/stable/643334?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents), and non-feminist histories of female rights such as [\"Favored or Oppressed?   Married Women, Property and 'Coverture' in England: 1600-1800\"](http://www.academia.edu/746242/Favoured_or_oppressed_Married_women_property_and_coverturein_England_1660_1800).  \n\nIn the case of the academic stuff I recognize the problem: people generally prefer fast food to eating their vegetables.   But I still see a puzzling emphasis on the *really low effort* and relatively trivial posts verses posts highlighting the hair-raising discrimination that men and boys face.\n\nSo is this just an example of the average person being attracted to the lowest common denominator?   -- As in I'd rather watch wrestling than some high brow documentary?   Is the problem with R/all itself rather than R/MensRights?   (I've noticed that the number of actually sexist or misogynistic posts on this sub vastly increase when we reach R/all).   Is there a conspiracy afoot?  ;)  And finally, what is to be done?",

    "text": "I couldn't say no. A feminist piece. When I was five I started Kindergarten in Philadelphia. I was one of only a handful of girls in the class. At recess the boys would trip me and push me and call me names. I was small and not a fighter but to keep myself safe I would bite them. Everyday my parents would come pick me up and find me in the time out chair. The teacher would approach me and say, “Harley, aren't you sorry for what you did?” \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nWhen I was in fifth grade I was the only girl to join mathletes. I competed and won. I was the best person on the team. My teammates would tell me that if I were captain boys would feel intimidated by my success. They assured me that they would still let me have a voice but asked if I would be willing to not join the executive board and instead let four male peers run the team. \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn middle school I wanted to join the golf team. There wasn’t a girls team and a girl had never competed with boys before. They told me I had to drive a ball 100 meters which I could successfully do. They told me that as a girl, I could only join practice but not actually compete. They said I should be thankful they were even letting me do that. \n\nI said thank you and nodded my head because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn high school I started dating a boy. He was popular and well known in a city I was new to. He was funny and charming and smart. A few months into our relationship he confessed to a locker room of boys that we had had sex despite it not being true. It was important to him that people thought we had and my persistent protest didn't matter. He reminded me how much he cared about me and that I could depend on him for support at my new school. His friends would excitedly ask me if it had happened. I swallowed my pride and the truth. \n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nMy first year of college I met a boy that lived close to my dorm. We hung out many nights and became close friends. He was interesting and made me happy but never seemed too interested in me. My roommates assured me that if I gave up my modest fashion sense I could attract him. They dressed me in a skin tight red dress. They smeared dark makeup on my eyelids. They pulled and straightened my hair and put me in heels I could hardly walk in. When they were done they took me to a mirror and proudly said, “You look beautiful. He's going to love it. Don't you?” \n\nThrough tears and disbelief in how different I looked I said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn my second year of college I was out late studying. I didn't want to walk home in the dark so I called a taxi. I made clear to the driver that I had a credit card and no cash. He said that was fine and started the meter. 4 dollars later I tried to hand him my card. He complained that the card company would take a percentage and that this was too low a fee. I again explained that I had no cash. He locked the doors and became aggressive and angry. I paid him fifteen dollars. An eleven dollar tip to make sure I could get out of the car unharmed. As I left he said, “See that was easy wasn't it?”\n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nIn my third year of college I was walking down a back road in broad daylight. There were other students on the street and I felt very safe. I was wearing a summer dress and flats. An intoxicated homeless man grabbed me in places I did not consent to. I ran, crying, home and contacted the police. After several months of meeting with detectives and correctly identifying my assailant he spent one night in jail. My case worker called and proudly told me, “I told you, that if you are honest and diligent, the justice system does not fail. Aren't you proud of what we've done?”\n\nI said yes because I couldn't say no. \n\nNow it is my last year of college. I have become loud and to many people annoying. I call out the blatant sexism most of our society is willing to ignore. I worked hard to put a competent woman in the white house and had to watch her say yes too many times. I marched with thousands of women to protest an encourager of rape culture from sitting in the oval office. \n\nFor 22 years of my life I have been conditioned to say yes. Today I start to say no.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

Every time a woman talked about feeling uncomfortable around a man, calling them creepy or anything of the likes, everybody attacked her. It was all these \"niceguys\" who were saying she should be lucky to have the attention. Lucky to have the attention from somebody that robbed her of her feelings of safety. Just go on Google. Search \"creepy man\" for Social Anxiety Support Forum. And watch before your eyes, as people tear down uncomfortable women for being creeped out by somebody making them feel unsafe, even though they have a right to safety. For choosing who and who they don't want to date. Making them feel bad for turning down somebody who clearly was sending the wrong vibes. Smh. Hate to break it to them, but we won't bang every sleaze that comes up to us and says \"heeeyy pretty girl.\"  It makes me so upset that they expect us to want to do that in the first place. They're creepy because they reek of entitlement. Nobody's entitled to my vagina. I choose who I let in very carefully. We have a right to choose.",

    "text": "the effectiveness of the female perspective in podcasting I am a comedian, and I host a podcast with my girlfriend about the complexities of dating, and understanding the opposite sex. I want to tell a quick story about how I changed perspectives on the issues that women face on the day to day grind.\n\n'The Sex Actually Podcast ' is equal parts stories of sexual experiences, both successes and failures, and also cautionary tales of where past relationships have gone wrong. We talk about what drives us, improving communication in our dating lives, and how our family upbringing molded us into who we are today. One thing I've learned spending countless hours chatting with Tasha, my live-in partner and cohost, is that women don't always have the luxury of sharing stories of the freedom of a drunken night gallivanting around town. Too often the story ends with a man fucking up a woman's trust and freedom to be present.\n\nI guess this post is a 'feminist teacher appreciation post', which I look forward to doing more often. Instead of shaming me for not walking a mile in her shoes, or shunning me for not being able to relate, Tasha takes the time to explain to me her day to day experiences. I've learned to listen. Just last week, an innocent trip to the grocery store ended with her being followed around several aisles because a man decided it was the appropriate market to be hitting on women. He didn't accept her social cues and commented on her boobs by telling her 'looks like your girls are out to play'. Ya dude, Frozen Food aisle is the new tinder. And the thing about men is, he would have never made her feel uncomfortable if I was shopping with her. We respect women in the presence of other men, but then when alone, cowards like frozen food guy emerge with their witty pickup lines.\n\nTasha will never know the freedom that I have to get drunk with friends, stumble home on the subway, interview for a job solely based on merit, and so many other countless basic rights. I am a comedian, it is a privilege to speak my opinions. Tasha works as a model. She's a brilliant thinker, very well read and a major advocate for the feminist movement. Yet, she is encouraged to not show emotions, never mind take a stance on social issues. Some men want to look at models, not hear them think. It makes the models human, and that ruins their experience. Can't keep that boner hard if these models keep yapping about ways to improve humanity. Yuck.\n\nThis past election season Tasha posted an instagram pic in support of Bernie Sanders. She was nervous to share her opinion, as most of her photos are lifestyle images, showing off a carefree and opinion less side of her. Most of Tasha's following was supportive, but it only takes one asshole to highlight the issues women face. “You're not pretty enough to offer thoughts on politics. UNFOLLOW”. Quick research showed us that this comment was written by a dude who is a college football coach and father to a teenage girl. THIS opened my eyes to the shame and control of thoughts that men put on women. Now clearly this man has issues, but he said what a lot of men think. 'Not now honey, the men are talking...'. A quick attempt at doing something meaningful that doesn't exactly fit into the confines of her job description was swatted down effortlessly by a stranger online. I was there to comfort her, but the helpless feeling of not being able to confront this dude face to face helped me realize that women feel that feeling everyday. Not being able to fight a fare fight. Unfortunately it took the ignorance of another man to show me which side I want to be on. Tasha and I bonded that day.\n\nWhat I love about our show and our relationship in general, is that we challenge each other's point of view. We are fortunate enough to be having a dialogue together that I've never had with women before. We don't always agree on every issue, but I hope other couples are having similar discussions. Understanding each other will help us resolve the issues that come from a lack of empathy. Respect isn't something owned only to our mothers, sisters and wives, but also to the stranger at the grocery store, or woman walking alone on the street. Men, we aren't losing our seat at the table, we're just finally letting women enjoy the meal with us. Lets listen.\n\nThanks for reading my 'appreciation post'. If you want to listen to our podcast, here's the link. Thanks so much for the love! -Dave Neal\n\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/sex-actually-with-dave-neal-and-tasha-courtney/id744156889?mt=2",

    "text": "My employer is insisting that I am the victim of sexual harassment even though I said I am not. They even hired a lawyer for an investigation. I WAS NOT SEXUALLY HARASSED WHY ARE THEY SAYING I WAS??!?!?! Obvious throwaway account, because... yeah...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI dated a guy. I started working at his family's business. (About 50 employees) We broke up. (My idea) It was hard, but we made it through and continued to work together. We had some emotional struggles, but whenever something came up at work, we took distance or a mental health day or some space. Our work was not impacted. We did not have discussions or anything of the kind in the workplace. We kept that stuff at home, because we're adults. We even own a business together on the side.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFast Forward to 6 months after the breakup, and the business owners (his parents) inform me they are investigating allegations that I was sexually harassed at work. I didn't make any complaints. In fact, I told his mother in a personal conversation (so personal we discussed her granddaughter's need for easier access to tampons in the conversation), that we had resolved everything and our friendship and business relationship were better than ever.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne working day later, she tells me that he is suspended from work. I will now only work in the office under her direct supervision, literally across my desk from me. (I do all their web design, social media, marketing, etc) She tells me they have hired an investigator to look into the sexual harassment that happened at work. I tell her there was nothing, and I don't want an investigation. She tells me she would like me to cooperate with the investigator but I don't have to. I told her I was uncomfortable with the new work situation and wouldn't be into work for a while, jotted off an email about training a replacement if that became necessary (NEVER SAID THE WORD QUIT), and went home. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am getting phone calls at home from coworkers I have never even talked to outside of work, asking questions about this alleged sexual harassment. Someone even suggested there was a quid pro quo sex for employ situation. My reputation has been utterly trashed. According to someone else, patrons of the business (I work in the back office, I never encounter patrons) have come forward as witnesses to events that never happened. A coworker I have literally never spoken to allegedly made a report about witnessing an incident... This is the worst game of telephone ever. Everyone is getting in on the action.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy Ex/BusinessPartner/NotHarassingBoss is banned from talking to me by his parents. I cannot conduct my own business. (Crucial tight launch schedule, he is integral to our business, this is damaging our business)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI didn't tell anyone at work about the process of our breakup. Nothing happened at work beyond one or the other of us taking a long lunch break or day off without any drama. I never made any allegations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI feel like I am being gaslighted. How can the owners, the coworkers, etc. keep telling me I was sexually harassed, if I wasn't? Can they even do an investigation into something on my behalf if I say it didn't happen? I worked SO HARD to keep it together after the breakup and be a strong business woman and handle things with dignity and I was really proud that it didn't damage my work. But here they are, insisting I am the victim over and over and over with lawyer's letters and investigator phone calls, and emails.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe owners have moved my full-time position to seasonal employ and said that even if I did come back, I would end when the season ends on Oct. 31, so I have basically gotten fired. I can't find an attorney who wants anything to do with a mess like this in my small town. Even if I could, I am a single mother of two. I don't have cash for an attorney. I barely have the cash to pay my bills.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am trying to hard to deport myself with dignity, but it is not happening. I feel like it is worse harassment to insist to me that I have been harassed when in truth I worked very hard to keep my work life professional to the utmost extent.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTLDR: I said I wasn't sexually harassed. Why won't they believe me and why are they having a lawyer investigate? This can't be right.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Adding in tons of stuff because I can.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone for the friendly conversation and suggestions. I haven't been able to discuss this with anyone due to my desire to be discreet, and it has been enormously therapeutic and helpful to vent a bit and hear others thoughts on the issue. I'll be sticking around for a while because it feels really good to discuss this after a long week of keeping everything bottled up. Thank you Reddit.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEDIT: If I feel like I can update without complicating the situation further as things progress, I will. Thank you everyone.\n/endrant\n\nEDIT2: I have details to update. This is structured firing. No question. I have document to post & etc, since nothing can get worse and I appreciate everyone's input and support. I'd rather make you guys happy since the job is already hell. Update post coming shortly.",

    "text": "My niece is being stolen from us because apparently the rights of a bio-mom matter more than the safety of a child. I'm sorry Reddit, but I need to vent and I can't think of anywhere else to do it. Feel free to ignore.\n\nMy sister did what a lot of people wouldn't do, and accepted my now brother-in-law's child, a little girl of 3 years old, with open arms. We welcomed that little girl into our family with happy open arms. I suffer from depression, but I swear to get to have the chance to hear her scream \"UNCLE!\" and run into my arms never made me feel better in my whole life. My sister took to motherhood so well it honestly shocked me. She had always been level headed, strong willed, and creative, but these traits magnified when it came to taking care of this sweet kid. In situations where I was sure a screaming fit would be oncoming, she could work miracles, and we saw her behavior improve vastly from when we first met her.\n\nBut there is her bio-mother. A woman who admitted that my sweet little niece is just a paycheck to her. On record no less. That she poked holes in my brother in law's condom and had been shocked to find out that he wanted to be part of his kids life and that he was just \"Suppose to go away and make the damn support payments.\" This woman was toxic, but we could deal with it.\n\nThen she started showing up with bruises. She wouldn't be changed, wouldn't get fed, would have clothes or precious toys \"Disappear\" and go silent if asked what happened to them or just say \"Mommy was angry.\" or \"Mommy's boyfriend was angry\". We pushed to take custody of her and finally got the majority. However, the GAL said that the \"Biological mother\" should retain half custody and so she got sent back to her mother's. But the bruises got worse. We documented, and pushed, but the court ignored most of the evidence, even such lovely gems as the above comments.\n\nThen came the bomb shell. One of the other little girls in the bio-mom's house had been raped and was abusing my niece. At the advice of my niece's therapist, and my brother in law's lawyer, they took her away from that home. As things have been pushed further, it was found out not only was my niece abused by the other little girl, but that Bio-mom's boyfriend had raped her too. \n\nI didn't want to believe it, but no child should be able to describe the things she did to her therapist. So, the therapist reported it. We all geared up to fight what was gonna be a painful to fight battle. \n\nThen, the GAL tipped off the rapist. Told him the identifying features that my niece had given, and he changed things (Piercings and removals, ect) to prevent ID. She also tipped them off to a polygraph weeks in advance so he could pass it.\n\nHer response when confronted with her actions? \"The mother knows best for the child no matter what dangerous situations other people put her child in.\"\n\nWe're all heartbroken. We could easily lose this fight with such an important figure in the proceedings deliberately moving against us. It isn't fair. My sister is the best mother this girl could hope for, especially with all the pain she's dealing with. But she's going to be stolen away because the Bio-mother matters more than the father or the mother who actually cares and takes care of her. My sister is 100X the mother that awful woman is, but because she isn't \"Blood\", they don't care.\n\nI don't expect anything to come of posting this. I just needed to scream into the void as it were.",

    "text": "How do I get a job out of college? I graduated college. Had nearly a 3.5 GPA. Got on the dean's list my last year of college. Got my degree in psychology. And now, I can't get a job.  \nIt's been 7 months since I've graduated. I've put in applications from everything from HR positions to psychology research internships. The ones that I have heard back from denied me instantly. One job, which emphasized that it didn't require any previous experience, denied me after the interview (in which the interviewer continuously mentioned the fact that you don't need experience), with an email stating that I wouldn't be hired due to lack of experience. I thought the phone interview went well. I thought all my cover letters have been very good. Thoroughly researched the companies, followed guides for cover letters online, the whole nine yards, and now I wonder if they even read the letters or just see my resume and say \"nope.\"  \nThe only job I could get was in fast food, which was supposed to be temporary.  \nMy resume was created with the help of the career counselors at my school, so it should be proper format, well written, etc.  \nI don't get why I'm getting denied instantly from the over 100+ jobs I've applied to, including ones that don't even require a degree. Some only required a high school diploma or GED, or even associate's degree. I had quit my warehouse job, which paid well enough for me to get out of my parent's house, had a 401k, had vision/dental/health, and was steady, because I was always told that college would get me farther in life, so I prioritized school over work and left that job. And now, I lost the best job I had ever had, and can't get hired anywhere else, had to move back in with my parents, and I have no foreseeable future.  \nI have a college degree, and I work with 16 year olds in fast food. I'm 25, live with my parents, and I can't even afford health insurance. My job has no chance of moving up. I can't even get my foot in the door with any company, whether they are big companies or small companies.  \nI've had a diverse background of jobs, mostly low paying minimum wage standard jobs, from fast food to cashiering, with my warehouse experience and an internship in a completely different field sprinkled in between. Nothing has lasted more than months or a few years, due to the majority of the positions being seasonal. Maybe that's the only reason I get denied from everywhere, because \"jumping around between jobs\" looks bad...but you can't really help that when the only places that will hire you are temporary.  \nI also fear that one of my previous jobs, which I quit due to a hostile work environment, may also be giving me bad recommendations. The boss was extremely discriminatory toward me and other previous employees, and I wouldn't put it past her to lie, or even to disclose confidential information to other companies to get them to not hire me as well. I don't know if she is doing that, and I have no reason to believe she is, but I wouldn't put it past her-this woman bullied and harassed a coworker of mine to the point of suicide, so I wouldn't put much of anything past her. I also know that she knows that I can still sue her for harassment, and also that I refused to give a statement to her lawyers when she was trying to cover her ass from a wrongful death lawsuit. I generally put \"do not contact\" under this employer when applying for job applications, which probably looks bad as well, the whole \"if you don't have anything to hide, then you won't hide it\" reasoning. Even when I do put do not contact under that employer, that probably doesn't guarantee they won't contact them, and if they don't have that as an option, it's just on my resume. I wonder if I should leave that job off my resume, but I don't know if I can, or if having a year gap of unemployment would look worse.  \nI know the biggest thing that would help my resume is experience in a particular field...but no one will give me a chance, so I can't get my foot in the door anywhere. I feel trapped, like I'll never be able to progress in life, that I'll be stuck in fast food forever, that my college degree was useless, that maybe I'm a victim of circumstance or maybe there's just something wrong with me. On paper, I've qualified for nearly every job I've put in for. I've even applied for bullshit data entry positions. I was told that for many jobs, it doesn't even matter what your college degree is, just the fact that you have a degree is enough. So far, it doesn't matter even if the job posting asks specifically for my degree or the area I studied in school, I still get denied.  \nI don't know what else to do. I can't really afford to have an unpaid internship just for experience, and even if I could, the ones I applied for within the past two years all denied me anyways. I don't know if returning to school will help or not. I'm told it would, getting a higher degree would get me the job, but that's what I was told about my first degree, so I'm inclined to think that's bullshit. Everyone I've talked to with decent jobs only got in because of friends or family-it seems like it's all \"who you know\" and not \"what you know\", many of which weren't qualified at all for their jobs. Unfortunately, all the people I know are in the same boat as me.  \nHelp?",

Would greatly appreciate some advice. \n\nMy circumstances are as follows:\nI'm an almost 30 years old woman, and with a young toddler. Have immigrated to New Zealand, now living in a small  town. I'm not a native English speaker, although my English is very good. \n\nPre-baby I trained as a lawyer (in a non-English speaking country). I enjoyed studying law, and wouldn't mind working in that field, but i can't say that i'm passionate about it. Retraining as a lawyer would carry a significant cost and time commitment. I have no ambition for ever becoming a partner either. I would quite happily settle for a mid-level position.

I don't mind trying something new, but I also know that ideally I wouldn't like being in front of a computer all day. \n\nAs far as personality, I tend to be just slightly on introverted side. I get along with people reasonably well, however I find it hard to connect with people. I enjoy quiet nature walks, gardening, spending time with my son. I don't need expensive things, but value stability, being able to pay the bills and purchase health insurance. \n\nAt one time as worked as a court clerk and greatly enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of people interaction and rules/structure for me. Unfortunately this career is on it's way out, court clerks being replaced by technology.\n\nI've also dabbled in teaching, non-profits, retail and bakery but concluded neither of these were a good fit for me.\n\nWhere should I turn next in my career search?\n\n**tl;dr: tried many careers, not passionate about any of them. is it worth trying to get into IT?**",

Even talked through property, civ pro, and contracts with counsel at Apple (whom I babysit for) who told me I was ready for finals. \n\nA week before Finals I panicked, went in to try to withdraw and the school didn't let me. \"You'll be fine,\" they said \"you're just paranoid.\" I ended up DQing. It is the hardest thing I have ever been through. I was the first woman in my family to go to any type of graduate school and I failed. The last 3 months have been hell. My confidence is too low to take the baby bar and I had a professor tell that I won't pass it. \n\nI wanted to go to law school to join the fight for criminal justice reform i.e. stopping solitary confinement, bringing awareness to sexual abuse in prisons, decriminalizing the severity of drug offenses...what have you. After DQing another professor  recommended me to a part time non ABA law school that will transfer my credits but will take be 3-4 more years.

I know I won't be complete in life until I shed light on the injustices in the criminal justice system and until I personally do something to fight it.

    "text": "If women shouldn't have to explain anything when getting an abortion, and can get an abortion whenever they want, men should have the right to disown an unwanted child if the woman doesn't wants to have an abortion. Children should not be used as one sex's financial shackle to the other. After seeing a post on the front page about women never having to justify abortion, and worse, to be able to use it as a form of birth control, I feel this should also be mentioned.\n\nStory time! Sorry for the grammar and everything, English isn’t my first language.\n\nThis happened to a family member of mine. He and a girl he met slept together without using a condom. Alright, up until now I'd say screw them both, they knew what they were risking; however, they seemed mature about it. The man (Family member) couldn't financially support a child without dropping out of university. The woman wanted to keep the child for whatever reason (I think it was about morals or something along those lines), but accepted to take care of the child and sever ties with him.\n\nAlright, great yeah!? Mature, reasonable decision on both sides. The man would stay in university and the woman would take care of the child she wanted to keep with the help of her family. That should have been the end of it right? Wrong. Fast forward a couple of years. Yes, YEARS! The man is contacted again by the woman. She wants him to meet her child. I say “her” because it was decided they would sever ties years ago.\n\nAlright, I get news of this. And I'm rather a huge jerk and always assume people will act towards me as I act towards them. They want the upper hand and never do anything out of the kindness of their heart, but we’re not here to judge my character people, it’s just relevant to the story.\n\nSo I tell him not to respond, I tell him NEVER to reply to anything she sends. I explain to him that she just wants money out of this, that it’s not worth it. She’ll fuck him over because she lives in a shit town in a shit part of the country with no jobs and failed relationships and she’s seeking easy money to feed herself because she’s probably a failure.\n\nDid I tell you this family member is sentimental? Well, he is. So the woman beats me by showing him picture of that kid to him and telling him that since she told him stories of his dad the kid wants to meet him. He gets emotional and suddenly he wants to meet the kid and talks to him on skype. I knew where this was leading, he was being manipulated, but I couldn’t reach his guilt tripping mind about how this was only a ploy to get him to get more involved in the life of this kid until she would demand money. \n\nAfter a while, what do I learn about this fuckass woman from nowhere? Just before contacting the family member she had broken up with her loser junky/pusher boyfriend. It didn’t matter though, because he already went to meet that kid and see them in person (kid and woman). They live really fucking far away too. I’ll also mention that he has a good job, north of 45k a year, I just *know* where this is going. So I tell my family to somehow convince him. It fails.\n\nA couple of weeks later what does she asks? That’s right! MONEY. SHE WANTS ZE MONEY. I’m not fucking rejoicing here. This was a failure on my part, but this is only the beginning folks. So the family member says he can take care of them if they move into his town and he’ll visit often. Fair, right? He’s got a heart of gold that guy. He does all this while being married to another woman who’s understanding enough to support him through all this.\n\nWhat’s the response from fuckass woman up in nowhere city? She doesn’t want the kid to meet family member’s wife, and wants him to only have supervised visits at her own place in nowhere. She also wants the money, of course, but the kid is only a tool to get that at this point.\n\nFamily member really fucking wants the best for this kid, so he tells her he’ll accept to have the kid during the summer and pay child support. That’s not enough, she wants more money than that, so she uses the kid again, denying him visits altogether and telling the kid his father doesn’t want to help.\n\nNow, family member paid over $10 000 in lawyers’ fees getting the ball rolling to get full custody of the kid. He and his wife live in one of the big city of the province, making north of 65k a year together. They are married, have a stable life with a lot of relatives living near them. Meanwhile, fuckass hoe has no job, a string of junkie exes trying to get (fuck) her back, live in nowhere town, can’t pay the bills, and is using the kid as an emotional weapon to get money out of him. \n\nFamily court is heavily stacked against men here. You know what his lawyers told him? He has less than 50% chance of even getting custody let alone full custody. Because women, for no good reason, are heavily favored in the courts. It takes child abuse to even nudge the court towards taking the men’s side in most cases. Short of child abuse or a really strong argument by them that would blow the judge away, he’ll only get to see the kid once every two weeks and have to pay out his ass in child support while junkie woman sleeps around and never works a day in her life.\n\nThis is why men should have the right to disown a child before birth up until the time a woman cannot get an abortion anymore. Never having to pay a dime to the woman. Right now, children can be used as financial shackles on men and often are used that way. If a woman can abort a child because of financial reasons, without asking the permission of the father who might want to keep it, that father should be able to disown that child for the same reason and never be bothered by the woman again.",

    "text": "My Harvey Weinstein was my high school teacher. This is my story. It happened in a small, wealthy, Catholic high school--run by Catholic brothers, fairly conservative, extremely sexist, extremely homophobic, extremely white, highest position held by a woman was guidance counselor. As a senior, I chose psychology as my second semester elective. The instructor was an alumni, been teaching a few years after 20+ years in law, and well regarded in the school/entire community because he was also the football coach. His son was a student in my year. To the football team, he was not only Coach, he was also their best friend's/teammate's dad. People hung out at this guy's house. This teacher was also my home room teacher all year. He knew exactly what rules to break to make him popular as a teacher--never marked you late no matter what time you strolled in, let you do homework, and didn't care if your shirt was tucked in. Every female was \"sweetheart\". He gave every male a personal nickname. He was very dad-like. \n\nSecond semester, day one of his class, he shut the door and it started. Basically, we were told that what happened in that class, stayed in that class. We were going to talk about things that the \"boss\" wouldn't like--sex, drugs, rock and roll type things. He set up an \"us\" against \"them\" mentality really early. He told us we were going to get really close. He made it clear that if you weren't going to be cool about it, you needed to drop the class. Then, he specifically stated: \"if i ever make you uncomfortable, come to me and we'll work it out, don't get an administrator involved and ruin it for everyone else\". He started slow: making stupid sex jokes, telling us about his glory days as a lawyer in the 80s, making comments here and there about women's bodies in general. Then the \"jokes\" got a little more graphic--throwing in lewd hand gestures. When we got to a lesson that included sexual harassment, he told us that sexual harassment doesn't happen anymore. Women routinely lie or exaggerate and it ruins men's careers. And when men do cross a line, it's because they don't know any better and women need to lighten up. In his unit on abnormal psychology, he thought it was important for us to know that \"some doctors\" say that homosexuality fits the criteria of a mental illness. About this time in the semester, his style of dress started to became more relaxed. He started wearing basketball shorts with no underwear rather than his usual khakis. This was a very small classroom so he was less than a foot away from you if you sat in front, which I did. He told us that he had \"friends\" that commented on how hot the girls were at our school. \n\nOne day at lunch, sitting with 3 girls from my class, I worked up the courage to say, \"so Coach is like...a creep, right?\" The response was essentially \"yeah, you didn't know?\" He only taught 2 classes each semester. All seniors. He was a guaranteed A. That's how he got away with this shit. Nobody is going to rock the boat a few months before graduation and he knew it. Right before final exams we played his version of \"Girls ask Guys\". We were encouraged to ask ANYTHING, without embarrassment, because questions were going to go in a hat. What happens in class, stays in class, remember? We were graded on our discussion participation but we could say \"pass\". A lot of sex questions came up because we were all 17/18yr olds trying to play this demented man's game. We went around the room and were pressured to talk about sexual fantasies, masturbation habits, penis size etc. There was several days of this. Looking back, I think he humiliated us for his entertainment. This was in 2010. Last I checked, he is still teaching. Every word of this is true and I would testify in court if his day ever comes.",

    "text": "Talk radio host Michael Savage's Depressing Attempts to Demonize Feminism (Among Other Things) Hey everybody. I haven't posted here before but I thought this recollection is relevant, both in an alarming way and as an example of the kinds of anti-feminist rhetoric making waves not only on r/Men'sRights, r/the_donald and the alt-reich pits of 4chan, but also on nationwide daily conservative talk radio.\n\nAs a fiction writer intrigued by the depths of conspiratorial thinking, conservative talk radio is like a nightmare paradise. I started tuning in pre-election to try and comprehend some of the right's perspective, principally the stuff the right is being told by their media. Aside from a constant stream of slant and innuendo, and general fear-mongering, this segment from a few weeks back really stuck out.\n\nSavage's topic: \"an epidemic of false rape allegations perpetrated by radical feminists.\" Fitting neatly with the \"Look at what's happening to our poor boys!\" trope, he asked for callers to relay experiences of faked accusations for the purpose of slander and character assassination. His first caller was a woman in tears. She was barely able to speak about experiencing a rape in her youth that she was never able to get herself to publicly admit before. It was very hard to hear, particularly when Savage was less than accepting at first, asking her why she never came forward, asking what she hoped to get out of admitting it now. Eventually he relented and wound the conservation toward some notion of an older, better America where \"your brothers would take care of it.\" \n\nThe next caller was a guy who was utterly on board with Savage's thesis. He said that his sister-in-law cooked up a story about him molesting her kids, even coaching them to lie to lawyers, in order to discredit him and get him fired from his job (which was successful.) When asked why she would do this, he said \"she just didn't like me\" (the most suspect sentence I've ever heard, BTW). Regardless, this fakery, while manipulative and wrong, had nothing to do with feminism and/or sexual assault of feminists. So Savage was 0 for 2 on his big evil topic. \n\nThe third was a guy who was raped while attending a christian monastery. It was another sobering discussion of sexual assault and the effects it has on the body and mind, denial, acceptance, the unstable road to recovery, etc. \n\nCaller after caller...zero examples of false rape allegations. The segment concluded with a nurse who specialized in processing rape victims, she laid out all the gory details of examination, while Savage tried to derail her data and facts with ideas like \"Well if there's no clear DNA evidence, the claim must not be believed, right?\" He didn't get far on this tract. Strangely, they ended up on mutual terms when ascribing a rise in rape incidents and rape culture to violent video games, violence in films and, both inherently racist and lazy, on rap music like Kanye West. The segment trailed off into Savage basically thanking his audience for a frank discussion of a very hard topic, and then the station was barraged by ads. \n\nConsidering where things ended up, it was easy to forget how it began-- Savage wanted to hear about devious man-hating and man-destruction by means of what he sees as a pivotal radical feminist tool, the pointed finger of accusation and the presumed guilt of the men being accused. But when exposed to real people in the audience, with real experiences, there was a near unanimous 180 degree turn. As brutal and frightening as his initial topic was, and how horrific it is that such concepts are preached to the masses as being some epidemic feminazi plot, he totally failed. It was heartening in a grim way. \n\nAnyway, thought I would share this attempt to demonize feminism, particularly because the response was not only lackluster but such a reversal. Other such BS, particularly online, gets hateful and vile very quickly.",

I had an interview a week ago for the most perfect job for me but to get the time off I said I had a doctors appointment in the morning. The previous afternoon the Principal (yes I work in a school) emailed saying I needed to speak to her before she could authorise my absence? She wasn't available all afternoon so I was feeling anxious all day, not knowing what to do. My line manager has been very reassuring saying it's normal behaviour here. The Principal came into my office at the end of the day and put me on the spot interrogating me about the appointment. She asked me what it was for as if it's a routine appointment she can't authorise it (?) but I said I'd been unwell at the weekend (had been off sick anyway) and that I still didn't feel right and I need to have some tests. She then asked if it was a fasting blood test and being on the spot I said yes and she continued to put words in my mouth that \"those appointments tend to be first thing so you should be back by 9:30 right?\" Me:\"Erm well last time I had to wait hours to be seen\" \"but you can turn up early to avoid that can't you?\"\nShe agreed to the morning off but then after speaking to HR came back asking me why I'd said I might not be back until 1pm? My job interview was the other side of the city at 10am and lasted 2 hours so I knew 1pm could be doable. So the interview ran over and the trains were all delayed so the earliest I could get back to work was 2:30! I decided to lie even more to my kind boss that I'd been ill at the doctors and was sick on the bus so wasn't going to make it in. I felt so guilty! She said that HR will want to see my appointment card! But I never get given an appointment card or letter unless it's something serious like a hospital appointment. I'm feeling super anxious about it now especially if I don't get this job. I'm actually thinking to hand my notice in and join an agency. I have a bit of money saved and a supportive partner but there's that risk of not finding work. I don't know what to do. An agency rang be back straight away after I submitted my cv to say they have clients always looking for my skills so I'm feeling a little more confident.\nThis Principal is a sociopath. She sacked a cleaner for taking unauthorised leave even though the cleaner gave 9 months notice and it was her step sons wedding she wanted to go to! Also she refuses people dentist appointments even if they're at the end of the day when it's quieter. I just want to get out of there. Its really stressful too 😢 Today they handed me a formal letter saying I have to meet with them to discuss my sickness absence as it's gone over their limit (they have a ridiculous HR policy) and that I might be given a written warning! Plus also I was emailed today that I have to start covering on the reception desk as they are short staffed. That job is my worst nightmare I hate anything people facing and it's a really high stress job as the parents that come into the school are abusive and sometimes violent :( plus I've always been let off other duties as my role is so busy that I can't be away from my desk.\nI still haven't heard about the interview and they were supposed to let me know 4 days ago but when I emailed them they said a decision hadn't been made yet. So there's still hope.\nI cried in the toilet at work today and then on the bus home. I feel like handing in my notice asap but I don't think it's a good idea. My boyfriend thinks I should do it the day before the meeting which will be in over a weeks time so maybe between now and then the agency or job offer will come. But also it'll mean I won't have to go through the emotional trauma of that meeting. The last time I had one they told me I need to wash my hands more if I'm getting ill all the time! I told them the stress of my job and the fact we work with over 1000 kids with constant colds is the reason why I've been ill! Plus I had flu and was signed off by my doctor but they just dismissed it. Plus yesterday I found out the head dismissed the manager of the school care takers because she didn't like him! He's a nice guy and works so hard but this woman is so evil! I just can't understand her logic. I think she just sees us as a resource and not humans with lives.\nI'm so sick of this bullying dictatorship and I'm seeing others being treated even worse than me 😢Really wanted to just walk out today and not go back.\nI should also say that this isn't what I really want to do with my life as I'm an artist and I'm getting more and more success and publicity so I know that if I worked somewhere with more flexibility and less hours like temping I could propel my practice. I just need to encouragement and to hear stories from others who may inspire me 😊",

I work for an artist and his very small company (3 people max) operates by its own very unique rules. I am essentially my boss's right hand woman and handle the maintenance of is studio, online existence, and assist in the art process itself. I have worked for him for three years and am ready to move on. Unfortunately, the position I am in will take some time and training to fill being that the relationship between artist and assistant is very personal/important. Do I notify him at the beginning of my job search and spend that time searching, and eventually training my replacement? What do I do in the event that a great job opportunity should pop up before a replacement has been found? I have all the respect in the world for my boss and want to handle this as professionally as possible despite the lack of traditional company policy. But let's be real... I am in my mid-late twenties and cannot miss the opportunity for better pay and health insurance. Thank you for taking the time to read and appreciate any and all advice!",

    "text": "(Help) Do I hold out for better work conditions or do I gtfo? P.S. my mom is my boss.... I'm a 20 year old woman that lives in an incredibly small town in BC, Canada, and I have been working at the same job for almost two years. It is a receptionist position for my boss who does taxes and bookkeeping, but not just that - we are the local Greyhound (bus) depot; we sell clothes, art and office supplies, and also display and sell art pieces from local artists. And that's not really the worst part.\n\nMy mother is the \"manager\" here and she got me the job.\n\nNow when I started working here it was ok. Gradually it just got worse, with my mother skewing the line between \"boss\" and \"mom\" (if her and I had a fight outside of work she would call me at work to scream at me over the phone, or show up while I was working to try and initiate a screaming match.) It was very unprofessional and stressful.\n\nThe most recent problem I have had would have started a few months ago when my mom, Lana (the boss lady) and I had a \"staff meeting.\" (Also to clarify - my mom and I were the only employees at the time). The meeting was to discuss giving me extra training to prepare for September / October because my mother was going to have surgery and needed 6 weeks off to heal. We were also going to hire another person to help me while my mother was off work.\n\nFlash forward a month later, and we had hired the new person. Except my mother had actually come over to my house after work to inform me that this new employee is going to be getting my training - because I \"simply wasn't ready for it.\" This was decided without talking to me at all. I was pissed but decided to just go along with it.\n\nFlash forward again to September when I am working with the new employee.... and found out they are getting paid more than me to do my exact job PLUS get the training I was promised.... PLUS getting guaranteed full-time hours, WHILE I WAS STILL TRAINING THEM TO DO EVERYTHING ELSE. \n\n(To just add insult to injury, I have never gotten a \"proper\" raise while working here in 2 years, the only time my wage went up was when minimum wage was raised. I'm currently getting paid $11.50 / hr with forced part time hours, and the new employee is getting paid $13.00 / hr, full time, to do my exact freaking job.)\n\nTo wrap it up my mother came back to work recently and I had explained my frustrations I had while she was gone. My boss had me coming in 6 days a week but made me fudge my hours so it looked like it was only 5; she makes me come in every Sunday morning to do greyhound stuff but refuses to pay me the minimum two hours she is supposed to; I was stuck training the new person and helping them while they somehow got the training I was promised. \n\nShe seemed understanding and said that she was going to schedule me to come in for a few extra hours and she was going to give me the training I had asked for, so I was excited! But, lo and behold, she comes to my house yesterday and said that she and Lana had a \"lunch\" and decided I still wasn't \"ready for this training\", that I needed to \"be the best I could be at my current position\".\n\nTheir reasoning as to why I am not ready for this said training is, get this - *the floors weren't clean enough and you didn't do a good enough job sweeping*. \n\nSo in between being underpaid, over worked, belittled and shafted at every turn, I don't know what to do. The reason I have stayed so long is that it's within walking distance from my house, and since this is such a small town there is rarely ever job opportunities. I am too chicken to ask for a raise and I am terrified of being jobless. It doesn't help that my own mother doesn't support me and will sit there and tell me \"you don't deserve shit, you don't do enough.\" Any help / suggestions are greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post.",

    "text": "I'm 45 and just realised that I am who I am. I look the way I look. And that is ALL THE WAY OK ! Lately I've been reading posts from girls/women strugling and asking advise on how to dress, how to act more business like and how to act more \"grown up\". All of this is something I have been struggling with for decades now.\n\nI'm surrounded by females who daily wear skirts, high heels, perfect hair and make up etc. And every goddam time I open Facebook I'm being bombarded with makeup tutorials by girls who look like greek goddesses even without make up.\n\nI have spent so many years of my life feeling inadequate even though I was lucky enough to have a mother who always reminded me of how beautiful I am. And on top of that, I have a husband who loves me. For me. For my looks. My brain. My humor. But still.....I'm 45 years old so WHY do I still feel like I'm not good enough.\n\nI'm chubby. I have large breasts (an added bonus according to my husband). I fit a L/XL. My hair is all over the place. Compared to my friends and female coworkers I have an eccentric dress sense. I'm always clean, and wear makeup and try my best to look good. I like Converse shoes. Moon boots. Ballerina shoes. Anything made with flower printed fabric. Oversized blouses worn as dresses. Pyjama pants. You get the picture.\n\nBut today, after a shower, I'm standing in front of the mirror doing my makeup. And I began trimming my \"gorilla\" like eyebrows. And it hurt like a mother*****. So I sat down on the toilet and gave myself a VERY STERN talking to.\n\nLook, I'm 45. I'm done with feeling inadequate. And so should all of you guys who have writing stuff like this here! And this is why; Tuesday I had a job interview with this famous photographer/artist. I was wearing my favourite outfit (dark blue multi flowered pyjama pants, gold ballerina shoes and a white oversized chiffon blousy thingy, unruly hair in a bun, and light make-up). When this woman (50+) open the door, she was wearing a bright red Chinese kimono, bare feet, and her hair was all over the place. She was so comfortable with herself that it somehow transcended to me. We sat barefoot in her kitchen and talked art, work, life and whatever else. She was just such an inspiration. Because she new who she was. What she was worth. And couldn't give a rats ass about what other people thought about her appearance. \n\nSo, sitting on my toilet this morning I have decided that who cares if I like to wear pyjama pants with flower print. I will never be one of those high heeled perfect hair office women. And at 45, so what ! \n\nRight now, I guess I feel exactly how my mother felt when she burned her bra !\n\nYoutube makeup girls - keep doing your thing if that makes you happy. \n\nAnd to all you other girls with tummy rolls, big breasts, gorilla eyebrows and no fashion sense what-so-ever! Keep being awesome unicorns. You got this !!! It's not the way you dress that makes you grown up. It's how you act. It took me 45 years to get here. \n\nPS. I got the job :-)",

    "text": "America Ferrera's Fiery Speech at the Women's March on Washington My name is America Ferrera and I am deeply honored to march with you today as the Chair of the Artist’s Table, as a woman and as a proud first generation American born to Honduran immigrants. It’s been a heart wrenching time to be both a woman and an immigrant in this country. Our dignity, our character, our rights have all been under attack and a platform of hate and division assumed power yesterday. But the President is not America. His Cabinet is not America. Congress is not America. We are America. And we are here to stay. We march today for our families and our neighbors. For our future. For the causes we claim and the causes that claim us. We march today for the moral core of this nation. Against which, our new president is waging a war. He would like us to forget the words “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” And instead take up a credo of hate, fear and suspicion of one another. But we are gathered here and across the country and around the world today to say — \n\nMr. Trump, we refuse. We reject the demonization of our Muslim brothers and sisters. We demand an end to the systemic murder and incarceration to our black brothers and sisters. We will not give up our right to safe and legal abortions. We will not ask our LGBTQ families to go backwards. We will not go from being a nation of immigrants to a nation of ignorance. We will won’t build walls and we won’t see the worst in each other. And we will not turn our backs on the more than 750,000 young immigrants currently protected by DACA. They are hard working, upstanding courageous individuals who refuse to live in the shadow of fear and isolation. They bravely took to the streets to declare themselves and to provide a voice and hope for their community. Today, we march with and for them. Together we, all of us, will fight, resist and oppose every single action that threatens the lives and dignity of any and all of our communities. \n\nMarchers, make no mistake, we are, every single one of us, are under attack. Our safety and freedoms are on the chopping block and we are the only ones who can protect one another. If we do not stand together, march together, fight together for the next four years, then we will lose together. Our opposition knows how to stick together. They are united in their agenda to hold this country back and to thwart progress; it is in their slogan. So we too, must stand united. If we, the millions of Americans who believe in common decency, in a greater good, in justice for all, if we fall into the trap of separating ourselves by our causes and our labels, then we will weaken our fight and we will lose. But, if we commit to what aligns us, if we stand together, steadfast and determined, then we stand a chance of saving the soul of our country. So let’s march together.",

    "text": "Business Careers for Creatives & Empaths? (ENFP) I feel as though I am shooting myself in the foot by setting my trajectory for a life path in a career that doesn't exist. \n\nAre there any business careers that would be fitting for artistic, empathetic, intuitive, charismatic, high emotional IQ, highly observant, innovative, extroverted, and emotional individuals?\n\nPersonally: \nI am a 24y/o female with an exceptionally established resume in retail, branding, and marketing. I've worked in the video game industry for 9 years (yes) and I am looking to transition to a completely different industry. If I didn't care about being successful, having loads of money to travel, and comfortably living in NYC I would be an illustrator for children's books and a wife. My passion is in the arts but I gave up the practice right before tablets started becoming a thing. (Kicking myself.) Although I was above average in art, I would never make it as an artist. Especially when your immigrant parents kick you out at 15. As a once bullied introvert I forced myself to step into communication-demanding jobs and I have surprisingly excelled to an impressive extent. I can handle jet lag, take on large projects, and philosophical, creative, and theoretical thinking is no thing for me. I might not be able to draw anymore but dare I say I am a visionary with a brain on fire. I want to create beautiful things and share with the world. So I picked up marketing (still earning my degree, paying tuition out of pocket. Sarcastic yay for the pressure put on first gens), managed to settle into NYC (and I got laid off in Dec, so if I don't figure something out quick I'm back to couch surfing.) \n\nIn a nuthsell I'm a once upon-a-time artist who's set her sights for a more left brained career path, but alas, my right brained skills will always be the stronger skill set. I CAN be business savvy if I educate myself but I will never understand numbers. I've learned to tailor my abilities for the business world, I'm an opportunist, I am energetic, I can lead when given the chance, I can figure problems out in unconventional ways. I feel the need to point this out purely for any reader's generous interest to help me out....sorry for how tacky this is going to sound...I'm a very attractive woman. Unconventionally attractive in my opinion (hello adult acne) but my appearance seems to have a significant effect on people when I interact with them. I hate having to describe this! I'm mentioning it because it hasn't worked as an asset for me yet, I don't think. Picture a 5'10, fit, overwhelmingly friendly blonde in a power business suit. Legally Blonde meets actually down to Earth, professional, and even socially awkward when you get to know me personally. I've been turned down and judged for my appearance and have actually had to turn to zero makeup and loose clothing to be taken seriously. I know some of you are rolling your eyes but this is a genuine issue for me. What I'm trying to get at is...does a career exist that would need attractive and highly intelligent people with an intuitive skill and understanding for humanities? A job environment where looks are either irrelevant or a preferred plus? Again, really sorry if I haven't described this in a more modest manner, it bothers me too and is cringey to describe myself in this way. To sum up, I can be presentable on demand and I can fine-tune or adjust my social settings depending on who I am talking to. I know how to talk to luxury-oriented critical types, business men, Type-A's, children, gamers, teens (I was a suicide counsler for a little while for troubled teens) and animals. LOL! I don't know, people! I'm blushing! Sorry! I'm being honest though! (Let me babysit your dog please.) \n\nUpon first impression someone would suggest that I be a spokesperson or a model. Great, I roll my eyes each time, but then after talking to me I'm always told that being a counselor or psychologist is \"my calling.\" Truth be told I am too sensitive for my own good and would never be able to carry the weight of other's trying times without taking it home with me. I become very invested in people I barely know should they signal that they need my help. I have to selfishly say that I cannot imagine helping people for pay and would not want that sort of pressure. Nor do I have the backbone for it.\n\nAfter a lot of research I've landed possible fitting careers for someone like me but its seemingly still kind of a reach:\nBrand Strategist / Director / Ambassador \nCreative Strategist \nMarketing Researcher / Media Planning \n\nI am capable of understanding analytics and utilizing them to solve problems. An example would be an extensive study on a particular target market and getting down and dirty with marketing acquisition. But my real dream is to work with a creative team where I don;t necessarily MAKE the work. Its all up in my head. Ok...if I had to describe my dream job casually it would be one that would enable me to call the shots on creative strategy decisions for a particular campaign, event, design, would demand that I travel and meet with high ranked reps or clients (I love that kind of pressure to represent and perform), would have me work alongside directors, and ultimately would utilize my educated baseline knowledge and experience on how marketing, demographics, trends, and how people generally work either in isolated groups or an entire community as a whole. I'm always expanding my cultural intelligence as well. I've been able to connect exceptionally well with almost all nationalities with a genuine interest in getting to know and respecting their customs.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Am I making the right move by considering something like \"Creative Strategist\" that would perfectly combine my Marketing Degree and natural born ability as an innovator and communicator?  Is there any one else out there with a similar dilemma? \n\nAn artist who can't draw. (Or super behind by art industry standard.) And a strategist who can't do numbers. HA! What dooooooo?????",

    "text": "Teenage Crisis: What should I do with my life? Hey, guys! I'll try to get to the point, as I hate when others drag on in their writing.\nSo, I'm a 16 yo kid, I'm poor (single parent, low wages) and a minority (although I pass as an American). I used to be one of the really smart kids when I was little (winning awards and stuff) but that's changed over the years. I'm a little less active in school, I feel less smart, find it hard to get motivated and am mostly depressed all the time.\nThat said, I am excited for college. I have a scholarship set up already (basically I get to go to uni for free). I'm excited for uni for several reasons: mostly because I look forward to being free of the hindrances of living with my mom (an elderly, sick woman who I love, but who makes me feel old, too, sometimes) but also because I want to FINALLY be myself and pursue my interests. My aunt (a doctor) tells me I should become a doctor too. She thinks if I work hard enough and get off my ass and pursue the dream, I can achieve it. Other people have straight-up told me I'm dumb and lazy and irresponsible and would make an awful doctor. I've been thinking about healthcare, business, law/politics and construction/agriculture mainly as fields I'm interested in.\nFacts about me\nSmarts: 3.8 gpa, mostly A student (and that's when I'm lazy) but I still feel like I'm dumb, probably because I hate myself. I'm a procrastinator, and that makes me hate myself most of the time and I don't know how to stop.\nPros: I'm artistic, creative, good with my hands, imaginative and good at analyzing literature & interpreting stuff, helping others, reading (i love reading) writing, expressing my thoughts, and -sometimes- teaching.\nCons: I'm lazy (trying to be better, though), depressed, slightly erratic, spontaneous, self-belittling, introverted.\nThings I like: Art, Literature Science (even tho I love it, I suck at it sometimes), History, Politics, Social Sciences, Psychology, Health Science\nThings I suck at/would probably suck at: Math, Physics, Engineering, Finances\nI'm torn between wanting to stay here and pursue a cheaper education which probably guarantees more money and moving out in the future OR leaving as soon as I have my bachelor's degree and studying while working & living on my own. I really, really want to live on my own as I HATE my current living situation. But I'm also open to staying, especially if it means a better situation with work in the future.\nWhat do you think? What should I do? What should I study?",

    "text": "Uncomfortable situation in a kindergarten class. Hello! So this literally just happened and I just need to vent. I work as a behavioral therapist primarily in the home but on some ocassions at school. Well, today I was working with a child during art class. The class is lead by the most air headed individual I've ever met. She has no control of the class, is constantly giving these little five year olds assignments they can't do making no effort to include the child I work with who has special needs, and just does dumb shit. The school is a nut free environment, because allergies, and yet the other week she brought a big ass tub of peanut butter to make a bird feeder with. The class freaked out on her about how some kids in class were allergic, I reminded her it's a nut free school and she said she didn't know. \n\nFast forward to today, after a ridiculous collage assignment we have artist of the day time. Now this is usually inappropriate as well, she picks artists, elaborated on their lives and deaths (sometimes including inappropriate information about how one artist tried to kill themselves and the other hated women) and will like have little discussions with the class about how artists died. It's just weird and inappropriate for a bunch of five year olds. Well today she picks an artist, I forgot his name, who basically tended to draw and paint lot of scenes about Boy Scouts and political issues going in. Well, she's flipping through this book showing them pictures and talking about it and then lands on a picture of Ruby being escorted going to school. It's a great painting and I wouldn't mind have had a problem with it if it wasn't for her commentary. \n\nHome girl keeps going on and on and on about how cute it is. Like \"awww look at this little girl going to school. Are those officers? Yeah those are officers taking her to school how lucky is she!\" And she's showing the class and I'm like \"I think that's Ruby Bridges going to the first desegregated school.\" And she says like \"yeah, isn't she so cute? She just looks like she's having so much fun.\" And as she makes her rounds around the class, I realize he n word is written on the wall Ruby is walking in front of. These kids are kindergarteners yes, but they're a year ahead in terms of academics and all know how to read. And it just irked me so, so, so much. She is a white woman, by the way. \n\nLuckily none of the kids tried to pronounce what it was or anything. And while I get it's just a painting she shouldn't have even showed that picture. A book full of paintings by this dude and you chose this Inez she could have used it as an age appropriate lesson on how it was dangerous for her to go to school or something that wasn't as ridiculous as that. I don't think I can like complain to the school about her or anything it's just really really annoying.",

Okay let me explain\n\n[Here is a pic of the artist and her sculpture](https://i.redd.it/zg8lweixf3oz.jpg)\n\n[She's really good. Here is some more work and background](http://mymodernmet.com/realistic-sculptures-luo-li-rong/)\n\nSome people on a reddit thread were arguing with a white guy who asked this same question. They said that it is his Eurocentric view that makes him assume this sculpture is a white woman.\n\nSo...\n\na) am I being an asshole for even questioning her preference? Because I'm going to fess up right now and say that seeing her next to her sculpture my mind just went straight to self-hate for some reason. And I'm just like, \"woah, I should take a step back. Why'd I go there so fast?\" I mean, it's obvious she has strong European influence, why not leave it at that? \n\nb) me and the white guy diverged because then he started talking about how there are a lot of white anime characters. He had a pic of a \"white\" one and then an \"asian\" and there was hardly a difference, imo. He could easily have claimed the Asian one was white. It was just hair color and bigger eyes that made the difference to him. \n\nc) I don't know that much about art and I can't help but feel like I looked at this in the simplest way possible. \n\nd) It made me realize if I were an artist I don't think I would ever draw/sculpt/paint white people.\n\ne: oh if you are a POC feel free to chime in, not just black ladies",

    "text": "Angry Letter I Wrote 2 Years Ago I can’t help but to think the only real reason I can’t seem to get any type of  production artist/ graphic design/ or screen printing position is because I’m a young black female. I usually hate throwing the race card in but I don’t know where else to turn. Never mind the fact that I have the degree required for these companies in the first place. It’s strange how every time I contact these companies when I see that there is a new space open they’re either “too busy” to take a minute to talk to me or the position has been filled. I polish my resume and cover letter well and because my name isn’t ethnic sounding I usually get asked to come in for an interview (Why is that still a thing in 2015?) Professionally dressed and well spoken. Only to keep getting turned down because I’m not the blonde Brittany stereotype that was assumed on paper.\n \nI can’t even seem to get a position at art retail stores. I don’t seem to fit the mostly white male hipster vibe most of them seem to have. When asked how I could contribute to the sales I explained how I do my own illustration and how I can give others that come into the store my own input on supplies and materials. Even left business cards at the end of the interview but I either get told that I’m too over qualified or too under qualified and don’t get the position. Most of the yelp reviews of one art supply store in particular was saying how most the sales associates don’t even know their products at all. \n\nThe summer between my junior and senior year of college I had applied to an AC Moore where the hiring manger was an alumni of the school I was going to and saw how qualified I was but did I get hired nope! I went back a few weeks later to pick up supplies for a watercolor painting I wanted to do and I happened to pick up a sheet of Arches cold press watercolor paper that didn’t have a code bar. The red haired girl ringing me up got confused and to this day that statement still rings in my head as she asked her co-workers “How much is this poster board?” I was done literally just done right then and there. I didn’t get hired but this girl who does not even know the difference between watercolor paper and poster board got hired probably solely on her looks alone.\n\nSame thing goes for all those companies that turned me down. One screen printing place had a manager that told me that he couldn’t hire me because he couldn’t afford to pay me. (But he sure as hell paid for a damn chiropractor the same day he let me go and spent half the day shooting hoops smh). Not all young black people like myself are the way Fox News likes to portray us; most of us have goals and aspirations outside of twerking or being labeled “thugs”\n\nI’m not “right” for those jobs but I sure as hell was qualified to waste seven months of my life working in a burger joint. Not once I did have the energy to even do my illustration pick up a pencil or paintbrush because of that dead end low paying barely making it job. Didn’t learn any new pen and ink styles I wanted to further develop but I was pretty damn good at salting fries all day. I was tired all the time and at 22 to 23 years old I should have all the energy in the world but I didn’t. In fact when my manger let me go he had just hired his brother as a line cook despite him not shaving his Santa beard and working the grill (nasty) must be nice.\n\nSo now I’m back to square one once more trying to hopefully get employed again soon. But right now my main focus is trying to get new artwork done since I spent the past year just kind of drifting because of financial worries. I have lost sight of this is something that I love and it’s not a job it’s me building a career. I still dream of being a children’s book illustrator and I’m not ready to throw in the towel just yet. In fact I want to strive to be the very first African American woman to win the Caldecott Medal. That the type of quality illustration I want to be making and if I ever get to that level they’ll be the ones sorry for overlooking me.",

    "text": "If you’re a man with a camera, you’re automatically branded a creep I used to work semi-professionally as a photographer.  What do I mean by that?  Essentially I was part time.  I had a great job as a software engineer that I liked and didn’t want to give up, but in my off hours I liked switching gears by earning extra dollars via photography.  I specialized in taking photos of the performing arts such as musical artists, plays, circuses, etc.  It was fun.  It was a very different challenge from writing code.  \n\nSo this 16 year-old girl found my web site and liked what I saw.  She needed some quality photos for her school’s yearbook and approached me to take them.  She asked me to take photos appropriate to the yearbook.  Not once did she ever request any nudity or anything else inappropriate.  She had an after school job and enough money to pay my rates.  Everything seemed completely legit.  Of course, I was well aware of the stereotypes that would brand me some kind of sick perv if I photographed a teenage girl.  I therefore turned to other photographers for advice on putting together a contract that would protect me legally.  She wanted a photos of her together with her horse.  There would be photos of her riding it, grooming it, and just standing beside it.  Nothing wrong with that, of course.  I still wanted a contract to protect me legally so that I would not end up falsely accused of any wrongdoing.  A protective instinct kicked in because I knew how hyper-negative people get toward men, especially a man with a camera.  \n\nI asked other photographers on a photography forum online if there were some kind of standard protective contract I could use.  Some photographers responded with good advice on where I could get such a thing.  Some also said I should require at least one parent present at the shoot.  Good advice.  However, others went berserk, accusing me of being some kind of perv out to rape that girl.  One asshole claimed that if it were his daughter he would immediately contact the police and the courts and get a restraining order against me.  He acted like I had proposed to make kiddie porn.  We’re talking about a photo shoot of a fully clothed girl in normal pictures with her horse – feeding it, riding it, normal stuff.  These were photos that were appropriate to a high school yearbook.  \n\nThese male-bashing bigots totally ignored my explanation of the content of the shoot and just assumed I would ask her to take her clothes off and do pervy things and that it would end with me raping her.  No amount of setting the record straight did any good.  It was unreal the hateful assumptions people made.  Some photographers came to my defense, appalled as I was at the overreaction.  Some correctly said that photographers photograph all ages.  Duh.  It totally depends on the content of the photos as to whether it’s appropriate.  It’s unreal how some people heard “fully clothed girl riding a horse” and translated that to “perv raping a teenager.”  \n\nI ended up doing the shoot, no thanks to the male-bashing bigots.  It went great.  I had a liability contract and I had her father present at the shoot.  Great guy, and great girl.  They were awesome people.  Neither of them made any of the absurd assumptions some idiots had made.  This was a case of a young woman who had earned her own money at a job and had chosen to spend it on some high quality photos.  Nothing more.  It’s unreal how some people will twist something like that into something sick.  \n\nOther photographers have told me about similar situations where they’re assumed to be some kind of perv because they have a camera with a telephoto lens.  If you’re a man and you take a high-end camera to a beach, you risk getting pestered and even arrested by police.  That’s a reason why I won’t even do beach photography.  Nowadays, I won’t even photograph someone who’s underage unless I know the people really well.  I was lucky at this shoot that they turned out to be terrific people, but if I had gotten the witch hunt idiots, it could have been dangerous for me.  I’m 100 percent certain if I were a woman, the whole overreaction and branding me as some kind of creep or perv would never have gone down.  “Girl with her horse” – he must be a sicko.  It’s unreal.",

(my experience with waxing salons) I'll try to keep this brief:\n\n  I'm an artist and have been subsidizing my income by working as an art model for a few years.  Because of this, I have to take extra steps to be fully groomed.  This involves waxing and shaving.  Because there are certain areas that one can not easily reach on ones body, I decided at one point that I would pay a professional to do certain things for me.\n\nI got turned down by about a dozen (no exaggeration;  It might have been more in fact) salons that refused to provide the service for men.  One woman actually said to me, \"No, we don't do Man-zilians (Brazilians for men).\"  I was basically given the boot by tons of places that said \"women only.\"  Turns out most of these salons don't like to serve men because they think we're all a bunch of perverts coming in for the wrong reasons.  It was near impossible, but I had to get it done.  I spent almost a week and a half looking for a place, and it was getting incredibly embarrassing for me (this was what discrimination actually feels like).  I finally found someone who would provide the service to me. \n\n*side note: She was nice, but what I found ironic was that while she was performing the waxing [we had a lengthy discussion about news], the topic of Rachel Dolezal came up and she said something about how women already have it much harder than men.

    "text": "For your information - a note about Linda Nochlin's \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\" If you haven't yet heard, the feminist Art Historian Linda Nochlin passed away earlier.\n\nIf you haven't yet heard of her, you likely will over the next few days or so.\n\nSpecifically, you will probably hear - and see - the following quote from the 1971 essay 'Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?' that made her name and reputation:\n\n> If, as John Stuart Mill suggested, we tend to accept whatever *is* as natural, this is just as true in the realm of academic investigation as it is in our social arrangements. In the former, too, “natural” assumptions must be questioned and the mythic basis of much so-called “fact” brought to light. And it is here that the very position of woman as an acknowledged outsider, the maverick “she” instead of the presumably neutral “one”—in reality the white-male-position-accepted-as-natural, or the hidden “he” as the subject of all scholarly predicates—is a decided advantage, rather than merely a hindrance of a subjective distortion.\n\n> In the field of art history, the white Western male viewpoint, unconsciously accepted as the viewpoint of the art historian, may—and does—prove to be inadequate not merely on moral and ethical grounds, or because it is elitist, but on purely intellectual ones. \n\nHowever, you are very, *very* unlikely to see some of her other comments made in the same essay - precisely because to many modern feminists nowadays it would be a practical heresy:\n\n> The fact of the matter is that there have been no supremely great women artists, as far as we know, although there have been many interesting and very good ones who remain insufficiently investigated or appreciated; nor have there been any great Lithuanian jazz pianists, nor Eskimo tennis players, no matter how much we might wish there had been. That this should be the case is regrettable, but no amount of manipulating the historical or critical evidence will alter the situation; nor will accusations of male-chauvinist distortion of history. The fact, dear sisters, is that there are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt, Delacroix or Cézanne, Picasso or Matisse, or even, in very recent times, for de Kooning or Warhol, any more than there are Black American equivalents for the same. If there actually were large numbers of “hidden” great women artists, or if there really should be different standards for women’s art as opposed to men’s—and one can’t have it both ways—then what are the feminists fighting for? If women have in fact achieved the same status as men in the arts, then the status quo is fine as it is.\n\n[ ... ]\n\n> Now the “Woman Problem,” like all human problems, so-called (and the very idea of calling anything to do with human beings a “problem” is, of course, a fairly recent one) is not amenable to “solution” at all, since what human problems involve is re-interpretation of the nature of the situation, or a radical alteration of stance or program on the part of the “problems” themselves. Thus women and their situation in the arts, as in other realms of endeavor, are not a “problem” to be viewed through the eyes of the dominant male power elite. Instead, women must conceive of themselves as potentially, if not actually, equal subjects, and must be willing to look the facts of their situation full in the face, without self-pity, or cop-outs; at the same time they must view their situation with that high degree of emotional and intellectual commitment necessary to create a world in which equal achievement will be not only made possible but actively encouraged by social institutions.\n\nI find it interesting that she is likely to be lauded as \"groundbreaking\" or \"pioneering\" as a feminist and celebrated by people who - if they actually cared to read the essay they are celebrating, would determine to dig up her corpse for the purpose of defiling it.\n\nI'd say it's worth your while to read the whole thing (archived [here](http://archive.is/F4eFQ#selection-629.0-637.429))\n\nEspecially the parts below:\n\n> “Why have there been no great women artists?” The question tolls reproachfully in the background of most discussions of the so-called woman problem [ ... ] The feminist’s first reaction is to swallow the bait, hook, line and sinker, and to attempt to answer the question as it is put: i.e., to dig up examples of worthy or insufficiently appreciated women artists throughout history; to rehabilitate rather modest, if interesting and productive careers; to “re-discover” forgotten flower-painters or David-followers and make out a case for them ...\n\n> Another attempt to answer the question involves shifting the ground slightly and asserting, as some contemporary feminists do, that there is a different kind of “greatness” for women’s art than for men’s [ ... ] No subtle essence of femininity would seem to link the work of [other women artists;] women artists and writers would seem to be closer to other artists and writers of their own period and outlook than they are to each other.\n\n> Women artists are more inward-looking, more delicate and nuanced in their treatment of their medium, it may be asserted. But which of the women artists cited above is more inward-turning than Redon, more subtle and nuanced in the handling of pigment than Corot? Is Fragonard more or less feminine than Mme. Vigée-Lebrun? \n\n**TL;DR** Feminist art historian has passed away aged 86; You're likely to see or hear a lot about her in the press and on social media in the form of inspirational quote, moody looking memes & etc. but I reckon 99% of people sharing her story won't have a clue what she actually wrote and would be quite appalled if they actually did e.g. she wrote that: \"The fact of the matter is that there have been no supremely great women artists, as far as we know, although there have been many interesting and very good ones [ ...] no amount of manipulating the historical or critical evidence will alter the situation; nor will accusations of male-chauvinist distortion of history. The fact, dear sisters, is that there are no women equivalents for Michelangelo or Rembrandt, Delacroix or Cézanne, Picasso or Matisse ...\"",

    "text": "Woman Excerpt from *All Things Considered* by G.K. Chesterton, Chapter 12:\n\n>\"Would not our women be spared the drudgery of cooking and all its attendant worries, leaving them free for higher culture?\" The first thing that occurs to me to say about this is very simple, and is, I imagine, a part of all our experience. If my correspondent can find any way of preventing women from worrying, he will indeed be a remarkable man. I think the matter is a much deeper one. First of all, my correspondent overlooks a distinction which is elementary in our human nature. Theoretically, I suppose, every one would like to be freed from worries. But nobody in the world would always like to be freed from worrying occupations. I should very much like (as far as my feelings at the moment go) to be free from the consuming nuisance of writing this article. But it does not follow that I should like to be free from the consuming nuisance of being a journalist. **Because we are worried about a thing, it does not follow that we are not interested in it. The truth is the other way. If we are not interested, why on earth should we be worried? Women are worried about housekeeping, but those that are most interested are the most worried.** Women are still more worried about their husbands and their children. And I suppose if we strangled the children and poleaxed the husbands it would leave women free for higher culture. That is, it would leave them free to begin to worry about that. For women would worry about higher culture as much as they worry about everything else.\n>\n>I believe this way of talking about women and their higher culture is almost entirely a growth of the classes which (unlike the journalistic class to which I belong) have always a reasonable amount of money. One odd thing I specially notice. Those who write like this seem entirely to forget the existence of the working and wage-earning classes. **They say eternally, like my correspondent, that the ordinary woman is always a drudge. And what, in the name of the Nine Gods, is the ordinary man? These people seem to think that the ordinary man is a Cabinet Minister. They are always talking about man going forth to wield power, to carve his own way, to stamp his individuality on the world, to command and to be obeyed. This may be true of a certain class. Dukes, perhaps, are not drudges; but, then, neither are Duchesses.** The Ladies and Gentlemen of the Smart Set are quite free for the higher culture, which consists chiefly of motoring and Bridge. But the ordinary man who typifies and constitutes the millions that make up our civilisation is no more free for the higher culture than his wife is.\n>\n>Indeed, he is not so free. **Of the two sexes the woman is in the more powerful position. For the average woman is at the head of something with which she can do as she likes; the average man has to obey orders and do nothing else.** He has to put one dull brick on another dull brick, and do nothing else; he has to add one dull figure to another dull figure, and do nothing else. The woman's world is a small one, perhaps, but she can alter it. **The woman can tell the tradesman with whom she deals some realistic things about himself. The clerk who does this to the manager generally gets the sack, or shall we say (to avoid the vulgarism), finds himself free for higher culture.** Above all, as I said in my previous article, the woman does work which is in some small degree creative and individual. She can put the flowers or the furniture in fancy arrangements of her own. I fear the bricklayer cannot put the bricks in fancy arrangements of his own, without disaster to himself and others. If the woman is only putting a patch into a carpet, she can choose the thing with regard to colour. I fear it would not do for the office boy dispatching a parcel to choose his stamps with a view to colour; to prefer the tender mauve of the sixpenny to the crude scarlet of the penny stamp. A woman cooking may not always cook artistically; still she can cook artistically. She can introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the composition of a soup. The clerk is not encouraged to introduce a personal and imperceptible alteration into the figures in a ledger.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNote that I have my disagreements with Chesterton (he was talking about me in *The Song of the Strange Ascetic*); he was fundamentally conservative while I am fundamentally liberal, but he was forthright about his views, held them honestly, and changed them when he felt it necessary.\n\nI would much rather be friends with someone like that with whom I disagree with than someone who agrees with me perfectly, but is dishonest, manipulative and closed-minded.\n\nYou don't have to agree with me, just don't try to bullshit me :)",

    "text": "Job Hunting Tips/Considerations from a Recent Grad I am a recent grad who spent over half a year to find my first full-time job (Tech Consulting) and wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding recruiting for a new job in my context. I am a young professional and would like to see comments about how I can improve the following notes.\n\nApplications: 400+\nInterviews: 20+\n\n--\n\n**Job Hunting Tips**\n\n1.\t**Align your interests** – Explore and identify various careers and industries that interest you. This requires experience, research, or networking with other professionals. Additionally, bringing awareness to what you are NOT interested in is as important as knowing what truly excites you.\n\n2.\t**Recognize your value proposition** - View yourself as a brand and highlight the skills which you can sell to an organization to benefit their business operations (soft/technical skills). Distinguish yourself as the best fit candidate for a role by elaborating on your unique knowledge or experience.\n\n3.\t**Create a company database** - Develop a list of companies which peak your interest by researching their mission, values, business model, etc (LinkedIn.com, Glassdoor.com, Indeed.com). Then, organize the list appropriately to efficiently filter them during your application process.\n\n4.\t**Strategize your search** - Using job search engines such as Indeed.com and LinkedIn.com are great; however, these platforms often fail to retrieve numerous job postings! Therefore, by applying for job applications directly through company websites, you will have full coverage of the public job postings. As a result, you may have a higher probability to interview for positions which receive lower levels of public exposure.  Lastly, familiarize yourself with specific search terms relative to your interests such as the following: Associate, Entry-level, and Junior.\n\n5.\t**Take advantage of your network** - Once you familiarize yourself with a company and its respective job postings, distinguish whether you have connections to the organization through LinkedIn. Expressing your interests to a network of professionals already associated with the company and sharing job requisitions may enable you to directly reach out to hiring managers. However, acknowledge that a professional will only assist you given that he or she believes you are fit for the role, since your profile directly affects his or her reputation for future referrals!\n\n--\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n1.\t**Don't close the door** - Apply for positions and companies above and below your ideal standard. It is possible that you may be interviewed for positions which you may feel are beyond your qualifications, but let the recruiters be the judge. Occasionally, recruiters forward resumes to other recruiters in the event that there is a job posting more suitable for your candidacy. Additionally, by participating numerous interviews, you will practice your interviewing skills and be more comfortable with the various processes.  \n\n2.\t**Preparation for perfection** - It is important that you practice your interview skills and be familiar with specific information regarding the company and the respective role. When interviewing, demonstrating your knowledge of the industry or company’s business operations will highlight your proactiveness as a candidate. \n \n3.\t**Reality vs Expectations** - It is important to be realistic with your expectations and capabilities when applying for a new job. Having high standards is important; however, be aware of the opportunity costs of chasing the ideal job. Thus, developing a timeline with milestones is a great way of keeping yourself accountable throughout the recruitment process.\n\n4.\t**A competitive pool** - You must acknowledge that each job posting potentially receives tens or hundreds of applications. Similar applicants may be applying for positions left and right each day; therefore, reflect upon your recruiting practices relative to the competitive pool.\n\n5.\t**Be persistent, not annoying** - When reaching out to a professional or recruiter, be certain that your tone expresses curiosity and excitement. Sometimes getting your foot in the door requires persistence and careful communication; however, be conscious of how you may be perceived on the other end.\n\n6.\t**Keep your calm** - After you have completed a step of the recruitment process and  are waiting for further instructions or information, try to focus your attention on other job opportunities. This is the time to be patient and allow the company to deliberate for further feedback. Remember, there is no harm to taking a break from applying to jobs and participating in various hobbies to momentarily clear your mind.\n\n7.\t**No written offer, no stopping** - Do NOT stop applying or participating in any recruitment process until you have received a documented offer. It is possible for an organization which has extended you a verbal offer to suddenly decide to rescind their invitation.\n\n8.\t**\"Resume Black Hole\"** - Applying for jobs may feel like countless hours of throwing your well written resume into a Black Hole. People often refer to recruiting as a “numbers game.” Although this may be a valid argument, it is probably still within your best interest to act strategically when on the job hunt. Lastly, searching for the next chapter of your career may be incredibly discouraging and upsetting; nevertheless, you must remain determined and gritty to succeed!",

    "text": "Trying to understand why I agreed to date my psychotic ex...... and really wishing that I hadn't Really need to get this off of my chest.............. The red flags were OBVIOUS, why did I waste my time?\n\nWe met last fall, in music fundamentals class at the local community college. Professor asked the class \"does everyone have their text book?\" \n\"No.... where's the book store?\" I announced to the professor and the whole class without much thought beyond transparency. There was a pause, professor blinked at least once and took a long few seconds to recover from his slight mental derailing. He answered with a helpful smile \"it's across the quad from the cafeteria.\" \n\nDuring first day introductions I noticed one person staring at me.... staring pretty hard.... plus staring is pretty hard to hide. So staring boy with the owl eyes approached my desk after class. He's wearing all black and has the longest black hair I've ever seen, so long it goes behind his knee caps. He says with a slight lisp \"I heard you don't know where the book store is, I could walk you there if you're not busy.\"\n\"Sure! That would be awesome! How nice of you to offer, thank you.\"\n\nBeau (pronounced Bo), my ex, was.. to be perfectly honest..... strange. very different from everyone else, but friendly with a heart of gold. He had a soft gentleness about him, made silly jokes, was always relaxed, listened intently and asked lots of questions. Not the type of person to judge anyone, more so the kind who gets judged by everyone as a \"freak\". His hair and finger nails were unusually long, he had a lisp, lacked confidence, carried a cloud of melancholy, was home schooled and wore finger less gloves. He was always true to himself, never caring if anyone else understood.\n\n\"Why judge this person? He's so kind. I'm open to making friends with anyone and everyone.\" That was the mentality that kept me walking with him after class, day after day, and saying yes when he asked for my phone number. \n\nOne day, we were sitting on a stone bench in between classes. I complimented his shoes, they were high top Vans with Disney's Alice in Wonderland characters floating on a black background. \"Thanks...\" he said \"... there's something I want to tell you.\" I stopped eating my banana in preparation for the news. He unrolled his tale: \"I contracted Limes Disease when I was 4 years old. It was left un-diagnosed until I was 15. When the disease effects someone that long, it begins altering their mind. I now have clinical depression and mild bi polar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as arthritis (the fingerless gloves have copper woven into them and actually help with stiff joints). All these things are side effects of the disease. I also had 20 surgeries in 19 years at UCLA to correct my clef lip and pallet. That's why I was home schooled.\"\n\nDamn. Can you really blame the guy? That's a rough childhood, medically. Seems like he'd really been through a lot and it deeply effected him, both mentally and physically. \n\nMaybe I felt bad for him, maybe I empathized with him. After all, he's not a monster. No one with a mental disorder is a monster just because they have a mental disorder. His news didn't change the fact that I enjoyed walking and talking with him after class. \n\nUnstable mental conditions happen to all of us at times in varying degrees, it's okay, it's natural. Brains and emotions are awesome and complex. That being said, I have an issue when someone begins making unstable decisions.\n\nWhat later ensued were, looking back upon it and reflecting, three MAJOR RED FLAGS that happened in a row. I should have listened to my gut and not continue to see this person. Instead I would urge myself to be less judgmental. But sometimes, we make instinctual ideas about someone for a reason. Maybe it's self preservation.\n\nLater that week he texts me, asking the address of where I work and what time. It seemed like harmless chit chat in the moment. ProTip: THIS IS TOO SPECIFIC OF A QUESTION TO BE CHIT CHAT, BE CAREFUL WHO YOU GIVE THIS INFORMATION TO! Beau shows up at my work at 5am....... first walking around the building, circling it a few times then after he realized we were closed he waited 1 + 1/2 hours until we opened. His behavior creeped out the regular early morning patrons of the cafe, my coworker and myself!!! He ordered food, ate it, then sat and watched me work.... I can't even describe how creepy his fixed look felt.... like something unclean was on my skin and I couldn't get away from it. I was so flustered and distracted that I asked to leave work. I asked Beau to follow my car back to my house, so I could properly explain how creepy his actions were, how uncomfortable he made me feel, and why I didn't think I wanted to continue our friendship. \n\nSo we get to my house. Protip: DON'T INVITE SOMEONE WITH STALKER BEHAVIOR BACK TO YOUR HOUSE, JUST SAYING, THEY'VE ALREADY DONE IT ONCE THE TRUST IS WEARING THIN. Hindsight is always 20/20. We start to chat and he explains that he has insomnia and because he was homeschooled and bed ridden most of his life, he's hardly made any friends. and he genuinely didn't realize how creepy his behavior was. Okay..... that reason was understandable, I suppose. But still, come on dude. I decide to not hold his actions against him and since I got the day off, we spend it listening to music and talking. Not sure what it was exactly, but something about Beau's personality charmed me that day. Did I mention what a fat crush this kid had on me? I thought to myself \"why not give this kid a chance? He's veeerrrrryyyyyy naive but has a good heart.\" \n\nWe decided to drive in his car to get sandwiches. Mostly, he wanted to show off his car since he built a lot of it himself and holds pride in maintaining it. We get less then one block from my house and Beau is shifting gears like a maniac. Suddenly we see a truck not quite making a U turn in front of us and flipping on his reverse lights to back up a little so he can complete his turn without hitting the curb. Yes, reversing was a dumb thing for this truck to be doing on a busy street. But Beau sees the reverse lights and instead of breaking he turns left- fucking left! into opposing traffic! Luckily, well not so lucky really but in comparison to how bad things could have been; lucky. Beau hits the middle divider and rips off his bumper while scrapping and flattening his tire. It was unreal. Looking back I should have recognized Beau's poor decision making, but I chalked the whole thing up to an accident and didn't hold the incident against him.\n\nAll these things happened in the same day... I shouldn't have deepened our friendship. this was an obvious indicator of what it's like to be around Beau. Why did I do it?\n\nWe continued hanging out as more then friends for another month. In that time I got an up-close look at his depression and other mental instabilities. He would talk in his sleep like no one I've ever known. Everything he said was loud, clear unsettling inner turmoil chatter. It was like hearing all of his deepest, darkest and most frightening thoughts..... I couldn't sleep next to him. I was freaked out at what I was hearing. Plus he would violently shake and spasm while he slept too. When we would be hanging out he'd randomly start crying, and not know why. he would text me or call me when he felt suicidal... at least once a day. he carried so many heavy feelings, it was weighing me down too. I began to feel trapped.... what if he killed himself because I broke up with him? He was that unstable...... \n\nBut enough was enough. I gave him so many life coaching tips about focusing on what he enjoys and all of the good things that were happening to him. he couldn't do it. Or maybe, he couldn't figure out how. I told him that the relationship wasn't enjoyable for me, and that he needed to work on himself. He asked me if I would stay with him if he saw a psychiatrist. I said yes...... but after another week I was still miserable, his presence was toxic. He had so much self-work that he needed to do on his own.\n\nThe break up was difficult.. he stalked me at work, school, cried on the phone for multiple days in a row. He sent relentless texts, voicemail and facebook messages asking for me back while simultaneously threatening suicide. It was so hard...... The only thing I could do was send him positivity that therapy and alone time will only strengthen him as an individual, and help him enjoy his life and eventually become stable enough to have a long lasting relationship with the right person. But that person was not me. He couldn't stop contacting me... I was his only friend. But he was exhausting, I couldn't be around him at all and had already given him too many chances... I blocked his phone number and all online social media. \n\nThen, he ran away from home. walking 26 miles with bare feet to come to my work and try to talk to me. Ironically for him, it was my day off... He told a coworker that he was homeless, he had no shoes and has been walking for 10 hours. I knew something was amiss, his parents coddled him and would never kick him out. I called them, and sure enough he had vanished after getting in a fight with his parents. They were worried sick and driving around all night. His dad told me \"We know that you don't want Beau contacting you anymore... We're sorry he keeps showing up at your work and in your life. we'll talk to him. and if he bothers you again; call the police.\" That was the last I heard from him..... that relationship was unsettling, toxic, heavy, unenjoyable.\n\nI ask myself; why did I do it? Why was I such a fool by ignoring the red flags?\n\nOut of curiosity and concern, I went to his twitter page today. He wrote a couple of days ago \"I doubt I'll ever get over you.\" Beau, I really wish you would. Moreover, I really, really wish I never dated you at all. If I could go back in time, I would have walked myself to the bookstore. Please heal, and be healthy Beau.",

Looking for help **Edit for details and now it might need a [Trigger Warning]**\n\n\n\n   **what happened;** in case anyone is reading this:\n   I have this really deep-seated belief that I'm filthy,that it's inherent and present regardless of what I do, and that I'll make anyone who gets near me filthy, too. \n\n\n\n   I wish I could talk about it with certainty, instead of feeling like I'm shrugging my shoulders and pointing to what's most likely. \n\n\n\n   My parents had a really volatile relationship. There would be bouts of fighting, with screaming matches and nasty accusations (from what I remember when I was a teen), interspersed with splits or times when they were trying to get along. \n\n\n\n   My dad cheated in ways that linked him to words like \"non-consensual\", \"underage\", \"illegal.\" All that happened mostly outside of my awareness when I was growing up, but my mom had a temper and a tendency to fling accusations when she was angry. \n\n\n\n   When I was in second grade, I remember doing things involving sex and stripping with friends, which seems weird, and I know we didn't want to get caught.\n\n\n\n   When I was in fourth grade, I think, I had a there was a month, at least, where I felt like someone was listening inside my head. I think I sort of made up a friend to talk to inside my head, but I'd talk to them, all *nudge, nudge* ~I know you're listening. \nI don't know why that happened or when exactly it stopped.\n\n\n\n   There wasn't a lot of content control in what I watched/read etc growing up, and I ended up reading a lot of books with rape in them at a young age.\n\n\n\n   When I was in fourth or fifth grade, I made a friend who I ended up always being vehemently furious with, though she never did anything wrong. I kept the anger bottled up, but it was always there when we were together. Her dad made my skin crawl; he made me feel absolutely disgusting, but he never did a thing to me.\n\n\n\n   I started truly, deeply believing I was too old and it was too late for things to be okay when I was 9.\n\n\n\n   In sixth grade, I started having intense depression feelings and suicidal thoughts and began publicly hurting myself in school in hopes of getting some help. I had one or two black outs during minor, non-stressful situations that I can remember then. I stopped sleeping in my bed.\n\n\n\n   I snapped in seventh grade. I was hurting myself more intensely then, could barely let anyone touch me. I liked a boy, and I think I slept with his shirt in my bed because it made me feel safer. I don't even know about any of this mess.\n\n\n\n   The night he asked me out is when I snapped inside. The short version is I'd always sort of thought I had to be able/ willing to sell myself, meaning give guys what they want, meaning be brave enough to kiss guys, meaning I don't know what- because I was 12 and had intense anxiety issues- since I was 9-ish. So, cute boy asked me out, which I was okay with and wanted, because we were friends. He was nice, and he, himself, never scared me or made me feel dirty. He's the one that made me feel safer when I hugged him. Before he asked me out, a lot of it was nerves, because he had already had sex etc with his last girlfriend, and I was very, very shy. But, the problem wasn't in what he did.\n\n\n\n   He asked me out; I said yes; he gave me a peck on the lips, and I felt nothing but this frozen, numbing terror and sickness inside me. And, there was the snapping, I guess. I thought the fact that I didn't feel anything meant I could only feel things when something bad was happening. I thought it made me disgusting like \"them,\" but I don't know what \"them\" I was thinking of. I was a monster. I was convinced, there was a twisted, sickness deep inside of me, and I couldn't let anyone know. It covered my skin, and I was sure anyone who looked at me would be able to see it. I broke up with the boy a few hours later, and I shut down.\n\n\n\n   I stopped talking to my friends, mostly, I was so ashamed in school, that everyone would see what a monster I was. I had panic attacks in school. I had mornings where I'd find myself in a lump on the floor, aching in the worst way, so afraid the sickness would break out or something. I spent some weeks obsessed with the concept of starving myself into a skeleton or eating until I was ballooned, because either way no one would ever touch me, and I couldn't let anyone ever touch me.\n\n\n\n   That same boy told me later in the year about times I'd come up to him in school to talk to him, where I'd talk about hurting myself (I was still self harming) but I had absolutely no memories of these moments, even when he would tell me te day they happened. He asked me out in the winter, and I remember a day in the spring, in the afternoon at school, where I was walking through the halls, and I just sort of didn't know where exactly the time had gone, in a strange way. I don't know.\n\n\n\n   By the next year, I couldn't look anyone in the eye. I couldn't make words come out of my mouth, even when I desperately wanted someone to ask me how I was so I could ask for help. I had panic attacks multiple times a day in school. I barely left the house. \n\n\n\n   My mom asked if I had PTSD, but I only associated that with 9/11 and war, and I didn't understand, so I said no. \n\n\n\n   I could never be honest with the one therapist she tried to get me to see when I was in ninth grade. It kind of felt like he was making fun of me, but that might have been teen angst. I do remember one therapy session where I sort of came to awareness hunched over with my hands over my ears and my eyes closed tight. He and my mom were both there and were trying to talk to me. I'm pretty sure some of the session must have been about my poor performance in school. I don't know why I sort of blacked out, or whatever.\n\nWhen I was 19, some of my friends, who I thought were sensible, told me they thought rape was the victims fault. They said it, just so matter of fact, and I couldn't stop crying for two days. Not always sobbing, but these streaming tears I just couldn't stop because it *hurt.*\n\n   I guess that's all I can remember right now. Like I said, nothing ever happened to me. I probably just read the wrong book at a bad age and heard my parents say weird shit. I don't know. But it's still like that same filthy sickness is inside me and covering me skin, and I guess I just don't know how to get rid of it, because nothing ever happened to me.\n\n\n\n   I'm very confused, and I'd love any help.\n\n\n\n   Please forgive typos and terrible grammar/punctuation and my complete inability to format this nicely, because I am trying, but it isn't sticking.\n___________________________________________\n\n\n   I'm not sure how to start this or what to say. \n\n\n   I want to see a therapist or call a crisis hotline for sexual assault or abuse, but I don't think what I'm dealing with counts as anything like that. It's from when I was a kid, but I never remembered any one touching me. I don't remember specific abuse, assault, violence.\n\n\n   I just had strange things happen, and some were shameful and some never seemed strange at all, until years after. I had a moment when I was 13 where I sort of snapped, and I kind of broke inside my head, and my word crumbled, and I've never recovered from that. I've never told anyone about it. Not in specifics, not all of it, but, again, none of it counts.\n\n\n   I used to tell myself, all the time, from a few months after the snap happened up til now, that if I just write it all down, all of it, get it out on paper, I could make it make sense, and it will stop infecting me and haunting me. I've never, ever been able to do it.\n\n\n   I tried to tell a friend once, about 5 years after the snap happened, and, without meaning to, lies just flowed right out of my mouth, because the situation is and was so embarrassing and pathetic.\n\n\n   Right here, what I'm writing, I'm still not talking in specifics, because how can you talk in specifics about something that made you filthy, when it came from inside, when you did it to yourself? But I still don't understand what happened.\n\n\n   I was only able to start thinking of talking about it  about three years ago, 8 years after the snap, when I was about 21. I don't have anyone I can trust not to tell other people or to judge me. I don't know where to go, what to do. It's eating me alive, and I don't know what to do. I'm not able to access any therapy right now, which is why I'm here.\n\n\n   I have memories of my third birthday, of being five and six and onward, so I don't think I have missing chunks of memories. I had blackouts starting a year before the snap. I don't remember anyone ever hurting me. It doesn't count as any kind of sexual abuse. \n\n\n   Is there anywhere I can go to talk? It feels like a sexual assault hotline would be the place, but what happened to me doesn't count. \n\n\n   I'm too scared to even write it here, because I know it wasn't real. It was me being weak and things I don't understand.  I'm afraid some one might recognize it, too, however rare the possibility may be. But I really need somewhere to let this out, because I've been trying to work on a Cognitive Processing Therapy workbook about it by myself, and I am not okay. I need help. Where do you go when you need help, but you're the monster?\n\n   Please help. \n\n\n   I don't know if I'm asking for somebody to tell me it's okay to write about things I felt and did and had happen that revolved around filth+sex here for some kind of guidance, or if I'm looking to be pointed towards a hotline or a forum. I know that most of the text of this post is just confusing, but I feel so stupid typing out what actually happened, because it wasn't anything. So, I don't know what to do.",

    "text": "I've lived in Iran and in the U.S. Anti-feminists on both sides mirror (and feed off of) each other. Warning: Long post.\n\nI grew up in Iran but moved to the U.S. about a decade ago. You can say I've seen \"both sides of the coin\" as far as societal attitudes towards feminism is concerned. Here are some of my observations:\n\n* Here in the U.S. you often see people admonishing feminists for focusing on \"first-world problems,\" while women in developing countries are grappling with much more serious issues. \n\n\n    You might be surprised to know that a very similar argument is used against women's rights activists in Iran, not necessarily by the state, but by conservatives at large. Iranian feminists are told that their focus on the mandatory dress-code (including hijab), on [the right to ride bicycles in public](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37430493), or on [the right to enter sports stadiums](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/30/banned-stadiums-being-woman-iran) is frivolous. \"What's the big deal about wearing a scarf on your head?\" \"Are you so defined by your attire that a piece of cloth is going to oppress you?\" \"You are diverting attention from real issues by focusing on getting women to stadiums.\" \"Not everyone can afford a bicycle. This is merely a middle-class issue.\"\n\n\n    Iranian women are also told they should be thankful to live in a state that keeps them safe from ISIS, because things could be a lot worse. Sound familiar?  \n\n* Statistics around issues like the wage gap, rape, and male-on-female violence have been contested over and over again in the U.S. They are called bogus, misrepresentative, and at best inconclusive. Meanwhile, statistics on mortality, longevity and well-being are used to show that American women have it better than men. \n\n\n    You'd think anti-feminists couldn't use the same argument in Iran, but they do. Longevity is similarly female-skewed in Iran ([and in most countries of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#List_by_the_OECD_.282013.29)). So we're often asked: \"how come you live longer if you're so oppressed?\" These anti-feminists point out that [Iranian women have a higher penetration in STEM fields than American women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyguttman/2015/12/09/set-to-take-over-tech-70-of-irans-science-and-engineering-students-are-women/#7b9d107e44de). That Iranian women are not subject to compulsory national service, as opposed to some developed countries such as Norway. That Iranian women are [less likely to have body-image issues](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/09/15/347083281/covering-up-with-the-hijab-may-aid-womens-body-image). In a way, we're told that we have it better than some Western women in some aspects, so we should stop being greedy about pursuing other aspects. Sound familiar? \n \n* Iran's theocratic regime has often argued that women have a natural tendency to nurture, and therefore need to stay home and take care of their children. Recently, they've discovered the fields of evolutionary/developmental psychology/biology and try to argue this point from a \"scientific\" perspective ([non-English link 1](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iILWu2n5hOEJ:www.tebyan-zn.ir/News-Article/zanan/2010/10/10/5607.html+&cd=12&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), [non-English link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0JZm_2vbc)). [Sound familiar](https://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/837287933312909313)?\n\n* In the U.S., some people argue that family courts unfairly favor women, especially in issues related to custody and child support. You might be surprised to hear that there are similar arguments in Iran, not around custody (which almost always favors the father), but around [Mahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr). Anti-feminists have vehemently opposed and dismissed the mandatory Mahr payout as a law that disadvantages men, conveniently forgetting that the scale is tipped the other way in almost any other legal issue. \n \n* The red-piller ideology has also found its following in Iran (and other countries I imagine). I've seen an increasing number of my old college mates and friends turn to red-pill/mgtow-type communities, especially on reddit. They even have a prophet (Roosh-V, who was born to Iranian parents). You might wonder, what makes them think they're disadvantaged and oppressed by feminists, despite living in country where a woman is literally worth half a men ([+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#3), [+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#22))? Is the illusion of victimhood so pervasive that it can elude some of the most gender-privileged people on the planet?  \n\n* The Islamic Republic has repeatedly accused women's rights activists of being Western stooges, for defending Iranian women's right to dress as they choose. Feminists in the West are repeatedly called terrorist sympathizers for defending Muslim women's right to dress as they choose. Both arguments twist the reality and turn a very simple issue (the right to choose your attire) into a tool for geo-political conflict. \n\nI expect some of you to say: but anti-feminists in the U.S. *do* have more convincing points, seeing that their country doesn't deprive women of their most basic rights. The ridiculous rhetoric of anti-feminists in Iran doesn't undermine the fair points raised by anti-feminists in the U.S.\n\nWell I do agree that objectively and definitively, Iranian law is far\nmore backwards in terms of gender equality. But there are three points to keep in mind:\n\n1. U.S. law didn't use to be very progressive either. Progressive ideas had to be argued into the law, by people who fought for them. The law often doesn't change as long as public opinion around it doesn't start to change. In that sense, anti-feminist rhetoric in the U.S. is not as innocuous as it's made out to be. I'm sure 100 years ago when women did not have the right to vote, most people were able to rationalize it as a necessary disadvantage for women, similar to how denying women a decent maternity leave is rationalized now. \n\n2. It's always easier to judge a nation from the outside. But when you live inside a country, you are exposed to the nuances and complexities of social issues, and might lose sight of the big picture. For instance, a Swedish citizen might view the U.S. as remarkably backwards in terms of gender equality, when it comes to access to abortion and affordable healthcare, violence against women, representation in politics, etc. But to some people living in the U.S. the issue is not \"so black and white\" (to use a phrase so cherished by anti-feminists). Iranian anti-feminists use the same argument (\"it's not as black and white as the West would like to portray\") to justify their incredibly backwards ideas. Sometimes it's good to take a step back to look at the big picture. \n\n3. The Iranian regime has learned to play the Westerners' rhetorical game really well. For instance: studies [have shown](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/18/secondary-schools-girls-gcse-results) that girls perform better if they study in gender-segregated schools. The Iranian regime has flaunted these statistics in defending its segregation policies, *as if they segregated schools to help girls succeed.* This type of hypocrisy can be illuminating when inequality (in any context) is discussed: **It's not enough when things work out. Things have to work out** ***for the right reasons.***\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to look at the global context when issues of women's rights are concerned, and it's also important to see beyond the rhetoric.",

    "text": "Anxious over college (f26) after being bullied. English is not my first language.\n\nI'm 26 and I'm back to college because I felt like i need a new start and focus on my career (dont want to be a cashier all my life). I dropped high school when I was 16 due bullying and depression. I have always been bullied. I'm not overweight and even though beauty is in the eye of the beholder i'm what is considered attractive by society standards.  However, I have always been this socially awkward kid who liked indie music and wore black... and this gave me trouble. I got bullied in high school for being very quiet and also I got bullied in some after school classes my mom got me because my bad grades even though I went with different people and all. No need to say I didnt had any friends.  But I'm not this quiet goth girl anymore! I have been working in the past years in my confidence, I'm learning to love myself (this is hard), know what i worth, work hard for my future and education. I've got my savings, I take my responsabilities. \n\nBefore getting in college this year I tried a few years ago to take a course. I went with such a positive mind, I was always smiling, trying to be friendly and nice... I started conversations, asked questions and I presented myself as friendly as possible yet I felt like people only talked to me because I talked to them first. I got interested in the people I talked to, asking them questions and remembered facts about them they told me before yet nobody got interested in me. However,  the group of people i tried to blend with in class decided to isolate me at some point, exclude me from everything... this hurt me so bad. Like, even with my best smile and a positive mind people reject me. Sometimes I wonder why, if I'm  maybe boring or annoying or weird. *Like whats wrong with me that I repulse people?*\n\nSo, I just started college and I'm one of oldest people in class and yesterday a teacher pointed  my age in front of everyone and asked me \"*what i just did with my life*?\" and if \"*i have any work experience*\" like, suggesting I'm a lazy fuck or something? \n\nI'm **VERY** anxious every day I go to class. Like every day i think i could make a small mistake and be bullied again. My heart beats very fast every time a teacher ask me to present myself. I feel terryfied by my classmates. I just have no idea what to do? Should I talk to them? Should I mind my own business? Seriously, I do like talking to people and I enjoy company but I just dont want to be rejected anymore. I feel like all my classmates are judging me and laughing at me. I feel so much pressure and stress and this is exhausting. \nI'm a person who have been hurt very bad. I've got so much rage inside of me (I try to work on this these days) and this situation is just emotionally exhausting.",

    "text": "Kinda dumb question about exhibit and deposition citations Doing the summer thing right now.  One person at my firm has a peculiar way of citing to deposition transcripts and exhibits, and I was hoping to confirm which of us is crazy.\n\nSay you have a deposition by John Black.  Their rule is that you cite like this:\n\n*See* Black Deposition Transcript at 55:16-18, attached hereto as **Exhibit A.**\n\nIf that same transcript comes up again, they insist that I cite it as:\n\n*See* Black Dep., **Ex. A**, at 16:24-36.\n\nSo they require that everything is cited as the person's name, deposition, exhibit letter, and pin-cite, every time.  They also insist that \"*Ex.

It seems strange, but when I went looking for other examples, I see a broad range of citation techniques to exhibits/depositions/deposition exhibits.\n\nFor what it's worth, this firm mostly does state-level trial stuff, but across 5 various states.",

    "text": "Judge: Suspensions OK For Albany High Students Who ‘Liked’ Racist Posts https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/judge-suspensions-ok-albany-high-students-racist-posts/\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An East Bay school district acted properly when it suspended five students who “liked” or commented on racist images on another student’s Instagram account that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach and comparisons of African-American women and students to gorillas, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe case raised thorny questions about how strictly schools can regulate student speech and whether “likes” on social media should be treated similarly to the original posts.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato said in his decision late Wednesday the five students contributed to disruption at Albany High School in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe judge rejected arguments that the Albany Unified School District violated the students’ free speech rights because the offensive posts were on a private account and made off campus.\n\nDonato said the accounts’ followers were mainly Albany High School students. The posts pictured students and school employees and created a risk of substantial disruption at the school, the judge said.\n\n“These cases establish that students have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence,” he said. “They have an equivalent right to enjoy an education in a civil, secure, and safe school environment.”\n\nAn attorney for three of the students had no immediate comment. An attorney for the other two, Darryl Yorkey, said “liking” images does not necessarily express approval.\n\n“I think the judge took an opinion that many of us do in the older generations in assuming that a ‘like’ on its face is just that, ‘I like it, I approve of it,'” he said.\n\nHe said many of the students who were suspended over the images were Asian and were just trying to shock each other.\n\n“Taken out of that context, it definitely looks really bad,” he said. He did not immediately know whether his clients would appeal Donato’s ruling.\n\nA phone message left with the school district seeking comment on the ruling was not immediately returned.\n\nA male student identified in court documents only as “C.E.” created the account in November 2016 and posted on it over the next several months.\n\nOne post showed a screenshot of a female African American student that she had captioned, “I wanna go back to the old way.”\n\nC.E. juxtaposed an image on the student’s post of a white man beating a black slave hung by his hands, according to Donato’s ruling.\n\nSchool officials learned about the account in March. They called in mental health counselors to help calm students and contacted police over concerns references to lynching, nooses and the Ku Klux Klan in the posts could constitute threats of violence, Donato said.\n\nC.E. was suspended and later expelled. Donato upheld his discipline as well on Wednesday.\n\nBut the judge said the district went too far when it disciplined two other students. One followed the account but appeared to have done nothing else and the other commented that the account was “racism solely directed at black people” with an emoji of a laughing face, the judge said.\n\nThe judge overturned their suspensions.",

    "text": "Police brutality Hello Reddit and thank you for your posts and support in my post about what has happened with my family. Sadly a month ago something else happened to me which has really screwed my life up. \n\nThe first week of June I was trying to help my friend get his driving license and he had to go to court to pay off a ticket from 2007. We got sent around to various court building until we got to the one which had the information on file. We were harassed by capital police from the start as my friend is a smoker and was told to smoke before he went in he would have to go out into the middle of the street to smoke. Fair enough we follow their rules and he put his cigarette out. We then proceeded to go inside of the courthouse. It's important to note that my friend has PTSD because the guard touched him a number of times and he asked that he not be touched because of his condition. Instead of the guard ignored this request. At this point guard from the other courthouse which was on the other side of the building came over and began to give my friend a hard time because he was asking questions about being touched and what gave the guard the right to touch him despite his PTSD. I was in searched and brought into the courthouse and I was likewise touched except aggressively because I was with my friend.\n\nIt's important to note that I am crippled and walk with a cane because I have fibromyalgia and I also have an anxiety disorder where any situation of extreme stress I can have what is known as a pseudoseizure. Once I was inside the court room I witness my friend still continuing to ask questions of the guard in a calm and civil manner until a minute or so later when the guard sick of being questioned instructed us that we had to leave. My friend was escorted out of the building and I having no business there and being the driver followed only to find the way outside to be blocked by the guards requiring me and him to go through them to get to our car. By this point multiple state troopers had joined in and I could tell that something was very wrong. I said to the officers \"thank you very much for your service, you are an asset to the community we have to go\" and I proceeded to walk to my vehicle which was 5 yards away in the handicapped parking spot in front of the building. I heard the officer from the other court who had been harassing my friend shout \"do you think you are going to get away with that\". I did not reply, I did not turn back, I did not even acknowledge it was said to me and proceeded to my vehicle. I placed my cane under my arm as I usually do so I can unlock the car and work the handle at the same time balancing on my good leg.however before I could put the key in the door the harassing officer grab my keys in my hand. My natural response was to turn to the officer and question what he was doing and why. From the other side my keys were grabbed by another officer and I turned to face him in my confusion and unbeknownst to me I had been surrounded by six officers. They had already stopped refrain from following me or crying out to me at the courthouse door. I was grabbed from behind and brutally assaulted. It was only after I had been slammed against my car and beat him to the ground that I was told that I was under arrest. I was also beaten while I was on the ground and had my head slammed into the pavement so hard that it cracked my safety glasses which are used for cutting grass and such. My friend was told that he was to sit on the curb and if he got up from the curb he would be tazed or shot. While they were attempting to retain me they threaten to tase or shoot me which I responded by saying that because I had a history of seizures and some strokes that either one would kill me. To inflict extra pain they cross my arms behind my back and cussed me that way so I could not untie my arms. \n\nHere is where my memory is foggy in the blanks filled in by my friend who witnessed this. My memory is foggy because I had a seizure as well as the concussion and was taken to the hospital but because they thought that I was faking they were beating on my chest so hard that it bruised my sternum. They were rolling my unconscious body around on the ground and my friend said that my hands were blue from lack of circulation. \n\nI regain consciousness in the hospital and I was in an extreme amount of pain. Testing was done on my head but no other testing or treatment was given to me despite having blood soaked clothes that were stuck to me by my own blood. I was given a strong sedative for the pain and secured sectional hospital with an officer monitoring me the entire time. I was then taking to lock up in my mother's car because I simply could not walk and she had a large enough SUV to transport me without an ambulance.\n\nWhen people arrived at this facility they were asked which can they use to write with and everyone except for me have the opposite handcuffed. I had my dominant writing hand handcuffed and I had all the paperwork brought in one page at a time and had my wrist crushed in the restraint which tied me to the bench sitting up every time. If not for my extremely poor health the judge wanted to have me sent to prison with a $100,000 cash bail. I have been charged with a number of things including 2 counts second-degree assault of a police officer. 2nd° assault of an officer basically means that while an answer was detaining you they suffered some kind of injury which in this case amounted to minor scrapes if anything. They also claimed that the inciting incident was a racial one and insisted that I had called the black officer a \"nigger\". \n\nThis is wrong on so many different levels that I cannot begin to describe it. I did nothing wrong I said nothing racial and yet I was legally viciously assaulted. Since then I have been bound to my wheelchair most of the time. I can't really walk very well anymore. This is wrong and needs to stop.",

    "text": "Oooh boy, need a hand in an argument Feminist argument, to my response that the movement is giving them a bad rep and she retorts the extremists don't represent feminism. I was woefully exhausted after preparing/being super social for an Easter Dinner today (plus meetings and other bs) so I probably came across as pretty dumb/incoherent but here's the conversation as promised nonetheless:\n\n\nMe: Man, glad someone else decent lives in town\n\nHer: Losing hope were you? I sure was.\n\nMe: I was getting there, lots of pride and feminist crazed people downtown that Iv'e run into, never mind alcoholics and druggies.\n\nHer: Ah. We've hit an impasse. I'm an alcoholic and a druggie\nKidding obviously\nBut I'm proudly feminist. And if tehre is a problem with that then I have a big problem with you.\n\nMe: Well, there are benign feminists who believe in equality I suppose. The movement at large sure gives them a bad rep though.\n\nHer: Haha\n\nMe: ?\n\nHer: I'll ttyl\n\nMe: Did I drive you off? I don't hate feminists, I've just run into quite a few who really go over the top. Calling for male genocide and other ridiculous stuff.\n\nher: Your complete misunderstanding of the \"movement\" and willingness to totally throw my ideologies to the wind drove me off ,yes. Funny how you complain about people in the city being awful and here you are as small minded and bigoted as the rest of them! Ha! For your information the belief in equality isn't \"benign\". It IS the movement. Those \"Crazed\" and extreme morons who refuse to shave their legs and call for male genocide are extremists and stupid. They do NOT represent feminism.\n\nMe: Throw your  ideology to the wind? The public faces of feminism have been misrepresenting stats and pushing an agenda. I don't expect all feminists to be the same but it's sad to see a great movement be dragged through the mud by people who command media attention\n\nHer: Do you believe that all muslims are evil because some extremists terrorize the world?\n\nMe: Well, we agree that they're extremists at least, and that feminists believe in equality. (not typed here, but I was thinking belief and action were *very* separate) I don't believe all Muslims are extremists but I do think passing a law banning islamophobia is absurd and ill defined. (I live in Canada)\n\nHer: \"public faces of feminism\" Because the only information you have on feminism is what you see in the public media. Because you've never taken the time to understand the basic and raw notions of what feminism actually is. No, you don't believe that feminists believe in equality. You believe that those of us who believe in equality are \"benign\". What a joke!\n\nMe: The public faces are the same ones responsible for writing laws, so naturally I should try to pay attention to them :/\n\nHer: Name One CREDIBLE public face of feminism who has written or passed some absured law that takes credibility from feminism?\n\nMe: Well, Australia's Cabinet for one (I couldn't remember her name, but she thoroughly embarrassed herself recently.)\n\nHer: Australia is the first country in the world to give women both the right to vote and hold national office. I can't imagine what else you're against.\n\nMe: They aren't the first..\n\nher: Yes. They are.\n\nMe: US and Canada have had female minsters and nearly a female president more recently.\n\nHer: Lmao. Not once did I say that Australia was the first country to have a female  leader.\n\nMe: Nothing is barring a woman from holding office in NA at least.\n\nHer: The USA has never had a female leader. \"nearly\" doesn't count. And I NEVER said they couldn't.\n\nMe: Minister, not Prime Minister. My point is, women do have the right.\n\nHer: Do you know when women earned the right to vote and hold FEDERAL office in Canada? Because it was 1902 in Australia.\n\nMe: Probably in the 70s for NA then, suffragettes took off in the 60s (not typed, but was just a big iirc moment)\n\nHer: I can't even continue this conversation right now. You're honestly wose than most of the people in this city. Telling me that you \"guess\" believing in equality makes me a \"benign\" feminist. And it's not about our fucking right to do anything, it's about equality. SEVENTY YEARS LATER.\n\nMe: Also, what does that have to do with present day?\n\nHer: And the right to vote was before the right to hold office. So the past is moot?\n\nMe: It's long before either of our life times. Fighting world war 2 long after it's over would seem a poor place to put your efforts.\n\nHer: So because civil rights happened in the 60s we should forget about it? Because residential schooling ended 30+ years ago we should forget that happened too? Or the holocaust... Completely ignore it ever happened because it was before our time?\n\nMe: Not forget about it completely your taking what I'm saying and blowing it up. There is no wage gap, glass cieling, or oppression. At least no in first world countries.\n\nHer: No. I'm not. Your discrediting a movement for EQUALITY because you've had bad experiences. That isn't because feminism exists. It's because you put yourself in the company of idiots. Feminism isn't completely about women's rights either. It's EQUALITY FOR ALL. Another think you'd know if you had half the brain to take your own understanding to it. Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me. No oppression? I'm sorry, what laws exist around your reproductive rights?\n\nMe: I don't have reproductive rights lol. It's literally woman's choice in just about anything sex or children related. My choice is whether or not to abstain or get cut, that's about it.\n\nHer: What rock are you hiding under? There are laws legislation what women can and can't do with their bodies. Abortion, Birth Control, etc.. Your choice. Exactly. You fucking have a choice. There are places where women have no choice.\n\nMe: Abortion is legal in Canad at least, birth control is medication.\n\nHer: It's not legal everywhere, Feminism is bigger than Canada.\n\nMe: Also you have the exact same choices and more, regarding abstaining or being tied. Bonus, getting tied is reversible.\n\nHer: And birth control is not covered in the same way other medication is. Do you know you're more likely to be covered for Viagra tn an Birth Control? (note: I think she meant than she/women are to be covered for B.C.)\n\nMe: Find that hard to believe, women take birth control for everything from mood swings to \"general health\"\n\nHer: Omg. you're fucking impossible. What the fuck do you consider \"general health\"? Birth control regulates hormones that can cause various cancers if left unchecked, it can prevent uterine and cervical cancer, and regulate blood pressure. Mood swings can be a side effect of abnormal hormonal activity which can be a side effect of deadly health conditions.\n\nMe: Where are you going with this, exactly? (at this point I had felt like the goal posts were moving often and I had no \"finish line\" plus I was tired af and this conversation was getting nowhere.)\n\nHer: And guess what? I'm only covered for $100/yr for my birth control and it costs $90/yr because insurance companies view it as a pregnancy preventative. Correcting your fucking statement that it's for mood swings and \"general health\"\n\nMe: Okay?\n\nHer: Sorry, $90/3 mo. Don't tell me that women everywhere have the same rights when it comes to reproductive health\n\nMe: It's shitty on both sides, this whole me vs you makes no sense. You think I like being treated like a walking rapist/criminal waiting to happen any more than you like buying tampons and getting stared at? Men are being demonized and made the laughing stock of society.\n\nHer: Then stop making it me vs you. I'm trying to explain that feminism is about EQUALITY. YOU are the one attacking the female gender claiming all who associate as feminists are crazy and it's all about male vs female and we all hate men. There you go again pinning the genders against each other!!!!! When did I ever say men were all rapists criminals? Chances are you know one too many extreme morons who call themselves feminists but you buy into that without doing any of your own research into it. Buying tampons means fuck all to me.\n\nMe: You give me one day I'll debunk at least 3 (almost typed 5, originally) accepted feminist views. Especially the wage gap that's been debunked a thousand times.\n\nHer: And if you want to argue that you're demonized and made into a laughing stock then may I remind you that women are slut shamed and a judge recently asked a girl who claimed she was raped why she couldn't just keep her legs shut? Don't play the who gets hurt more game with me. I Don't make this about pinning gender against each other. Can you for one second not fucking focus on wage gap!!!! Is that your only argument? Fuck sakes in what world did I even mention that? I'm trying to make my point and here you go focusing on one topic. And wage gap doesn't even pertain to white females. It primarily native Americans and black women. And that can't be debunked.\n\nMe: It's not just wage gap, it's suicide and rape culture/hysteria, it's this belief woman are oppressed by  the patriarchy and at the hands of men.\n\nHer: And no. I don't want to hear you \"debunk \" anything because I don't have any faith or respect for any of your sources. You're clearly not well versed on this topic. And why would you want to debunk equality?\n\nMe: I agree with you, on your point about believing in equality. (Tired of this  conversation at this point)\n\nHer: No. You don't. You called it a benign belief and not feminism. Which is wrong.\n\nMe: But I don't think it's so uneven, unless you go to third world countries.\n\nHer: I, never once, said women were oppressed by the patriarchy. You are focusing on this  popular media theories. You are the one misinformed. It is uneven. Don't tell me it's not. But I believe Canada and the USA are making fantastic strides! Because the right people are making changes. Change doesn't happen overnight.\n\nMe: What 's a right men have, that women don't? A legal, codified right we have that you don't? Legally, we're both boned about the same. We both have a load of shit to deal with.\n\nHer: WHEN THE FUCK DID I MENTION THAT I WAS ARGUING MEN AGAINST WOMEN. PLEASE FUCKING TELL ME\n\nMe: You're saying it's uneven.\n\nHer: You're the most aggravating person I've ever talked to on here. YOU are making this about genders I'M SAYING THERE IS NOT FULL EQUALITY BETWEEN GENDERS AND RACE AND CULTURE. I'm not pinning this exclusively on man vs woman. Stop making this about that. Stop trying to force me into baiting you with some bullshit you're going to turn around with your small minded views that you get right from the media.\n\nMe: We're literally talking in circles. You made your point that feminism is a bout equality, and that  women are missing rights. As for race and culture, yes there are many problems.\n\nHer: Women are missing rights. In some organization women HAVE to wear skirts to work. Why can't we choose to wear pants? Why can't men choose to wear skirts? It's not ridiculous for a man to wear a skirt. Once it was ridiculous for omen to wear pants and yet nowadays it's part of our regular attire.\n\nMe: But feminism, at least as it's defined, is about equality for women :/ Dress code for women is stupid, agreed. Especially heels.\n\nHer: No. That's how it's defined once again in popular culture. That's what you and your crazy psychotic extremists refer to it as. Feminism is about EQUALITY. Maybe you can't get past the fact that feminism has the word \"fem\" in it.. But that's just a damn title.\n\nMe: So you agree that popular culture had dragged feminism through the mud?\n\nHer: Yea. Female tennis players? Skirts are mandatory. Some country clubs in the USA are exclusive to men. Women are not allowed to be members. If you want gender examples, I have them. But don't make this about gender. No. I will not agree. Because That. Isn't. Feminism. That's what YOU call feminism because that's all you understand it to be.\n\nMe: Well whatever you're calling it, is taking a shit on your flag.\n\nHer: Because people, once again, like you and these idiots you're referring to, have it all wrong and refuse to stand corrected.\n\nMe: So if you believe in equality, for everyone, why not say humanist or equalist? Because these extremists have hijacked your title in the mainstream media.\n\nHer: Because humanism is a philosophical ideology and has a different system or beliefs and ideas.\n\nMe: Alright, equalist is yet to be defined rigidly and separates you from the crazy.\n\nHer: I'm not changing the title of a movement or belief I hate to satiate you. The fact that you have a problem with it is on you and makes you read poorly.\n\nMe: Fair enough, so why keep feminism if more and more people are turning it into something it isn't? You drive to say you're different, that they are the minority and not representative.\n\nHer: It is not my problem. The fact that you misunderstand it and you have a negative feeling towards is on you as well. It's disgusting and disappointing but still on you. More and more people like you? Because your arguments tonight are what is \"dragging it through the mud\". They're only representative to you because they're what you chose to believe. They're ideologies are what YOU chose to accept as feminism. If it were the 1960s and the civil rights movement was in motion would you be arguing with me that all black people are insane for wanting to use the same bathrooms as white people?\n\nMe: It's not just me.. Feminists have rioted at universities, and casually now (typo, meant joked) about  genocide and castration on national tv. I'm hardly the minority with this thought process.\n\nHer: THEY'RE NOT FEMINISTS. THEY'RE WHAT YOU ACCEPT AND UNDERSTAND AS FEMINISTS.\n\nMe: If you don't define yourself as anything else, and they continue using that title, my point is, eventually how are people to tell the difference?\n\nHer: Again, we go back to ISIS and Muslims. ISIS is what you see on social media and in popular culture. Would you like to argue with me that all Muslims are evil and every one of them are going to bomb the city? I am not going to change my beliefs to satiate the idiots who chose to believe false \"idols\" are the representatives of feminism.\n\nMe: ISIS is a terrorist group. Islam as a religion is hateful, even if not all of it's adherents subscribe to extreme action. It's why even now apostates fear for their life, why Muslims shun westernized society.\n\nHer: Says you. Someone who doesn't understand it and has no respect for their culture and beliefs. The Muslim religion isn't hateful. The extremists take it too far. They also do NOT shun westernized society. Have you ever spent time in the middle east?\n\nMe: You assume I have no respect for them, but I have a lot of respect for them. Especially the ones who denounce stoning and other medieval practices taking place.\n\nHer:I'm done conversing with you. Your small mindedness gets clearer and clearer with every misstep you take with me. Your beliefs are yours. I disagree entirely and whole I have 0 respect for anything you're saying but I, unlike you, respect your right to uphold your own values.\n\nMe: If  t here is a place that really needs feminism, it's the middle ease.\n\nHer: But yet you still assume they're all part of this hateful religion? Forget it, I'm done. I'm really done.\n\nMe: if they follow Islam out of fear of death or worse, are they really followers?\n\nHer: Goodnight.\n\nMe: Good night.\n\nHer: You're saying they ALL follow it out of fear? Bullshit.\n\nMe: Obviously not all.\n\nHer: That's what you're saying.\n\nMe: You're ignoring context of the discussion now, It's whatever.\n\nHer: No, I'm not. You're flipping your views and how you're saying shit each time you repeat yourself.\n\nMe: I thought you were pretty amazing, and I'm pretty shit at arguing, but it's pretty clear we'd have a hard time reconciling our beliefs. I do believe you believe in equality. But I think you're the minority among women who identify as feminist.\n\nHer: Jesus Christ, man. I'm not the minority. I'm just not what YOU consider feminism. When will you get that through your head? You're views aren't the is all end all of the world. YOU don't dictate what is and what isn't! And that's what you're trying to do. It's a damn shame that you have such an eroded and distorted view of society. Maybe you wouldn't have been so disappointing if this conversation was had in person. Too bad you misspoke before that happened.\n\nMe: I do think this conversation would've gone better in person. Anyway, at least in the US according to a few polls, only 20% of women  identify as feminist.\n\nHer: This has absolutely nothing to do with anything we discussed. It doesn't matter if 20% or 100% identify as feminism. You don't know what feminism  really is so it doesn't matter. It's too bad then.\n\nMe: You define it as equality, and try to separate yourself from the radicals. At least from what I've read. I wish I could start over in the morning, but I get the feeling you're too angry to even consider that. Rabbit hole of fuck ups, lol.\n\nHer: I DO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM THE RADICALS. Did you seriously not learn that at all???? I shave my fucking legs. That alone says it all.\n\nMe: Okay bad choice of words, clearly that's the theme of tonight.\n\nHer: Ha.\n\nMan that took a fuckload of time to type up. Anyway, I know I could've done that a lot better than I did :/  \nI'm pretty introverted, so when something like this comes up it feels like this huge test on what I've learned faking the whole extrovert thing and I'm somehow being graded.

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 4: \"Sisterhood is still powerful\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n**\"Sisterhood is still powerful\"**\n\nWhen the slogan “Sisterhood is powerful” was first used, it was awesome. I began my full-fledged participation in feminist movement my sophomore year in college. Attending an all women’s college for a year before I transferred to Stanford University, I knew from firsthand experience the difference in female self-esteem and self-assertion in same-sex classrooms versus those where males were present. At Stanford males ruled the day in every classroom. Females spoke less, took less initiative, and often when they spoke you could hardly hear what they were saying. Their voices lacked strength and confidence. And to make matters worse we were told time and time again by male professors that we were not as intelligent as the males, that we could not be “great” thinkers, writers, and so on. These attitudes shocked me since I had come from an all-female environment where our intellectual worth and value was constantly affirmed by the standard of academic excellence our mostly female professors set for us and themselves.\n\n\n\nIndeed, I was indebted to my favorite white female English professor who thought I was not getting the academic guidance I needed at our women’s college because they did not have an intensified writing program. She encouraged me to attend Stanford. She believed that I would someday be an important thinker and writer.\n\n\n\nAt Stanford my ability was constantly questioned. I began to doubt myself. Then feminist movement rocked the campus. Female students and professors demanded an end to discrimination based on gender inside and outside the classroom. Wow, it was an intense and awesome time. There I took my first women’s studies class with the writer Tillie Olsen, who compelled her students to think first and foremost about the fate of women from working-class backgrounds. There the scholar and one-day biographer of Anne Sexton, Diane Middlebrook, passed out one of my poems in our class on contemporary poetry with no name on it and asked us to identify whether the writer was male or female, an experiment that made us think critically about judging the value of writing on the basis of gender biases. There I began to write my first book at the age of 19, Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism. None of these incredible transformations would have happened without feminist movement creating a foundation for solidarity between women.\n\n\n\nThat foundation rested on our critique of what we then called “the enemy within,” referring to our internalized sexism. We all knew firsthand that we had been socialized as females by patriarchal thinking to see ourselves as inferior to men, to see ourselves as always and only in competition with one another for patriarchal approval, to look upon each other with jealousy, fear, and hatred. Sexist thinking made us judge each other without compassion and punish one another harshly. Feminist thinking helped us unlearn female self-hatred. It enabled us to break free of the hold patriarchal thinking had on our consciousness.\n\n\n\nMale bonding was an accepted and affirmed aspect of patriarchal culture. It was simply assumed that men in groups would stick together, support one another, be team players, place the good of the group over individual gain and recognition. Female bonding was not possible within patriarchy; it was an act of treason. Feminist movement created the context for female bonding. We did not bond against men, we bonded to protect our interests as women. When we challenged professors who taught no books by women, it was not because we did not like those professors (we often did); rightly, we wanted an end to gender biases in the classroom and in the curriculum.\n\n\n\nThe feminist transformations that were taking place in our coed college in the early ‘70s were taking place as well in the world of home and work. First and foremost feminist movement urged females to no longer see ourselves and our bodies as the property of men. To demand control of our sexuality, effective birth control and reproductive rights, an end to rape and sexual harassment, we needed to stand in solidarity. In order for women to change job discrimination we needed to lobby as a group to change public policy. Challenging and changing female sexist thinking was the first step towards creating the powerful sisterhood that would ultimately rock our nation.\n\n\n\nFollowing in the wake of civil rights revolution feminist movement in the ‘70s and ‘80s changed the face of our nation. The feminist activists who made these changes possible cared for the well-being of all females. We understood that political solidarity between females expressed in sisterhood goes beyond positive recognition of the experiences of women and even shared sympathy for common suffering. Feminist sisterhood is rooted in shared commitment to struggle against patriarchal injustice, no matter the form that injustice takes. Political solidarity between women always undermines sexism and sets the stage for the overthrow of patriarchy. Significantly, sisterhood could never have been possible across the boundaries of race and class if individual women had not been willing to divest of their power to dominate and exploit subordinated groups of women. As long as women are using class or race power to dominate other women, feminist sisterhood cannot be fully realized.\n\n\n\nAs more women begin to opportunistically lay claim to feminism in the ‘80s without undergoing the feminist consciousness-raising that would have enabled them to divest of their sexism, the patriarchal assumption that the powerful should rule over the weak informed their relations to other women. As women, particularly previously disenfranchised privileged white women, began to acquire class power without divesting of their internalized sexism, divisions between women intensified. When women of color critiqued the racism within the society as a whole and called attention to the ways that racism had shaped and informed feminist theory and practice, many white women simply turned their backs on the vision of sisterhood, closing their minds and their hearts. And that was equally true when it came to the issue of classism among women.I remember when feminist women, mostly white women with class privilege, debated the issue of whether or not to hire domestic help, trying to come up with a way to not participate in the subordination and dehumanization of less-privileged women. Some of those women successfully created positive bonding between themselves and the women they hired so that there could be mutual advancement in a larger context of inequality. Rather than abandoning the vision of sisterhood, because they could not attain some utopian state, they created a real sisterhood, one that took into account the needs of everyone involved. This was the hard work of feminist solidarity between women. Sadly, as opportunism within feminism intensified, as feminist gains became commonplace and were therefore taken for granted, many women did not want to work hard to create and sustain solidarity.\n\n\n\nA large body of women simply abandoned the notion of sisterhood. Individual women who had once critiqued and challenged patriarchy re-aligned themselves with sexist men. Radical women who felt betrayed by the fierce negative competition between women often simply retreated. And at this point feminist movement, which was aimed at positively transforming the lives of all females, became more stratified. The vision of sisterhood that had been the rallying cry of the movement seemed to many women to no longer matter. Political solidarity between women which had been the force putting in place positive change has been and is now consistently undermined and threatened. As a consequence we are as in need of a renewed commitment to political solidarity between women as we were when contemporary feminist movement first began.\n\n\n\nWhen contemporary feminist movement first began we had a vision of sisterhood with no concrete understanding of the actual work we would need to do to make political solidarity a reality. Through experience and hard work, and, yes, by learning from our failures and mistakes, we now have in place a body of theory and shared practice that can teach new converts to feminist politics what must be done to create, sustain, and protect our solidarity. Since masses of young females know little about feminism and many falsely assume that sexism is no longer the problem, feminist education for critical consciousness must be continuous. Older feminist thinkers cannot assume that young females will just acquire knowledge of feminism along the way to adulthood. They require guidance. Overall women in our society are forgetting the value and power of sisterhood. Renewed feminist movement must once again raise the banner high to proclaim anew “Sisterhood is powerful.”\n\n\n\nRadical groups of women continue our commitment to building sisterhood, to making feminist political solidarity between women an ongoing reality. We continue the work of bonding across race and class. We continue to put in place the anti-sexist thinking and practice which affirms the reality that females can achieve self-actualization and success without dominating one another. And we have the good fortune to know everyday of our lives that sisterhood is concretely possible, that sisterhood is still powerful.",

    "text": "The real reason women are not represented in tech First, I want to clarify I do not agree with the basis that women are not biologically suitable for roles in tech. I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. \n\nLet's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. \n\nThis demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!\n\nBut why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.\n\nNerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.\n\nSo they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.\n\nCompare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.\n\nThis is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.\n\nUnless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

Before writing this I hope I don't come off as misogynistic, these are honest questions that would like answers too.\n\nFirst off, how drunk is too drunk when it comes to sex and consent?

Between those two extremes every person handles alcohol differently, so how do you decipher that moral grey area?

    "text": "Finished grad school, got hired by a very prestigious organization in a position that I am frankly unqualified for and don't want to make a career out of. What do I do!? (X-post from r/career guidance in order to case a wider net) Buenos Nachos, good people of r/jobs.\n\nSo, last March I finished grad school. I fairly randomly applied to a data-science position with a world-renowned nonprofit which is a BIG name in my field. I never really expected to even interview for the position, let alone be offered the position. As I said, it's a data-science type position, which involves a fair amount of computer programming and statistics. Frankly, I'm utterly unqualified. I spent about 6 weeks learning enough about programming in a particular language to be able to sound like I knew what I was talking about during the interview, but outside of that, I had no CS experience. I also only took one math class ever in both my undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nI honestly have no idea how I landed a job offer, but given that this organization is so well known and well respected and in my field, I of course said yes. I've been working in the position for the past six months, and I've been doing everything I can to try and learn what I need to know to fulfill the responsibilities of this position.\nI've spent the last 6 months learning what I can about computer programming and statistics, and doing my best to complete any projects and assignments I've been given. I've spent hundreds of dollars on CS and stats textbooks to try and learn what I don't know, to try and be able to do this job, but I don't think it's working. The CEO and my Department's director have both expressed that they are impressed with my work, thought to be honest, I suspect that they simply don't know enough about it to spot that I have no idea what I'm doing. I often, as in on a near daily basis, feel like someone is going to realize that I really have no clue what I'm doing, which is incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nThe most important aspect of all this, I feel, is that the longer I'm in this position the more I realize that despite the potentially highly lucrative career opportunities, should I be able to make a career out of this type of work, it's not work I want to do for the next 30 years.\n\nSo, I guess that brings me to my question. Given that this data-science field isn't a field I'm comfortable in, and a field that I don't want to be in forever, and I really only accepted the position because having work for this organization on my resume will open doors in my field, what do I do? On the one hand, the longer I work for this organization, the better it looks, and I certainly don't want to leave after only being here for six months. On the other hand, when it eventually comes to light that I really have no clue what I'm doing (which I suspect will happen as soon as we try to publish a scientific paper I was requested to write, because people that actually know what they're doing will look at my work and instantly recognize that I'm clueless), I'm afraid that it will leave an indelible black spot on my career.\n\nSo how do I resolve that conflict between knowing that this isn't the type of position I want to make a career out of, knowing that I truly have no idea what I'm doing, wanting to have a position with this organization long enough that it will open doors for me, but having that feeling of dread and ticking time bomb-ness that eventually someone is going to realize that I am utterly unqualified for my position? Do I cut bait and start applying for positions that I'm actually qualified for/want to make a career out of immediately? Do I sit in my corner cubicle with my head down, wait for the other shoe to drop, and deal with that fallout when it happens? Do I wait around for another 6 months or a year and try to get out before anyone realizes that I have no business being employed in this position?\n\nI'm familiar with \"impostor syndrome\", and freely acknowledge that feeds in to some degree to my feeling of being a fraud, which is exacerbated by the fact that I often find myself going days at a time without really any \"work\" to do. However, I also freely acknowledge that, objectively, I do not have the technical skills or education to perform this position exceptionally and it is only the fact that no one in the building is a computer scientist or statistician that has prevented that revelation among my superiors.\n\ntl;dr - I bullshitted my way into a highly technical position with a leading organization in my field, I don't want want to make that position into a career (and I'm not sure I'm capable of doing so if I did), and I'm not sure how, or how quickly, to extricate myself before someone with the ability to fire me realizes I'm horribly out of my depth. What do I do?\n\nThanks for the advice, and I apologize for the ridiculously long post.",

    "text": "FDM Group IT Training Scam, Fraud & Deception There are many agencies and firms that claim to provide you with 'jobs' and 'training', but there is one particular company who seem to con some people and a few of my friends. Unfortunately, I was also conned by this disgraceful firm. This firm is called 'FDM Group'. The FDM Group and their 'Academy' scheme are simply a con. There are a few things you should be aware of. They mostly do NOT guarantee you a job in IT after training with them. Most people I know were forced to take up positions that were not related to their IT training. For example, one of my friends who wanted to be a Java programmer, was never actually given a job in programming. He was doing their training and then pushed into a 'call-centre' job doing some IT support - nothing to do with Java or programming. They struggle to put people into their so called 'guaranteed' jobs so they pressure you into doing something a 'bit' different - so they make their money out of you with a 'huge' cut in commission out of your wages. In fact, FDM Group employs sales people who have NO knowledge of the IT industry - it is no wonder that they supply jobs that are not even IT-related.\n\nI was simply conned from the start with FDM Group and their dodgy contract. They make you sign a contract before your training which contains some dodgy clauses in it. They employed an old faggot called Scott Black who is used to lure people into this deception and false contract. Scott Black is another guy who has been used to contribute to the scams of this firm. The FDM Group like to scare-monger people into doing the jobs that they want you to do - not what you actually want to do or have trained to do. After starting with the FDM Group, I heard rumours from a few other colleagues about the scare-mongering tactics that are used. Mr Scott Black and other staff members have been employed to do this scare-mongering activity. They tried to threaten me once and forced me to take a job with a Bank that was not IT-related and nothing to do with my vast range of IT skills. They might seem nice at first, BUT after you sign their contract you are simply stuck in a rut with their scam. Please note that you are NOT guaranteed 2 years of work after training. Their contract contains a dodgy clause in it - they can 'terminate' your contract at any time and for any reason at all. If you don't comply with their wishes of doing any bullshit job then they can use their dodgy contract to get of rid you at any time. While I did their training, I received hardly any support from their trainers who were pathetic in their attitude towards me. Most of the training itself is copied off the internet - you could probably find much of it already on the net. This is what other trainees told me after I started with FDM. After using and abusing me, they discarded me like a piece of shit. They used me as just another scape-goat for their fraudulent activities. FDM Group were going through some turbulent times and struggling – so to cut their costs……they cut a lot of jobs, and owe 1000s in wages.\n\nI later discovered that this firm was investigated for fraud and deception. In particular, their operations manager, Steve Buxton was investigated and convicted of several counts of fraud by conning many graduates and promising them with careers and training in IT. As well as a racist, who abused many workers, he obtained 1000s of pounds from vulnerable graduates who were desperately seeking their careers in IT. In 2003 Steve Buxton was convicted but narrowly escaped a prison sentence. He already served a prison sentence in the 80s for Fraud, but his close connections to important people at the FDM Group helped him to secure a new future and conceal his criminal past. The FDM Group managed to pull some strings in order to cover up the traces of most of their fraudulent activities. Their CEO, Rod Flavell and his assistant, Julian Divett, were also investigated for their part in the scam. Due to their cold hearted manipulation of people, they concealed their traces of illegal activity that they still continue to this day. They have changed their management staff and shuffled their executive team to hide the scamming and fraudulent activities.  Rod Flavell and his staff are despicable fraudsters and con artists who deceive and target vulnerable young people who simply want a future in the IT profession. It is astonishing that this firm is still in business and still trying to con many innocent graduates. What a shame to the IT industry.....The FDM Group mainly give pathetic or non-existent training, lack of support, bullshit jobs with fake promises and a dodgy contract. It's no wonder they were investigated for fraud and deception.",

    "text": "There Are Only 23 Black Owned Banks Left in America > Black-Owned Banks Hit Their Peak a Century Ago \n\n> In late 19th and early 20th century, 57 black-owned charter banks entered the system\n\n> Black-owned banks arose and flourished in a period when African-Americans were kept out of other financial institutions, both overtly and through practices that effectively walled off their neighborhoods from other banks.\n\n> The sector hit a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when 57 black-owned banks and credit unions existed. \n\n> Six CEOs of black-owned banks locked themselves in a New Orleans conference room for more than a day in late 2016. Surrounded by papers, drawing boards and PowerPoints, the group strategized ways to reverse a trend 15 years in the making: the decline of their own banking sector.\n\n> The number of black-owned banks operating in the U.S. has been dropping steadily for the past 15 years and fell to 23 this year, the lowest level in recent history, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That has left many African-American communities short of access to capital and traditional financial services, according to some banking experts.\n\n> “We have a crisis among black banks,” said Doyle Mitchell, CEO of Washington-based Industrial Bank. “We met…to save the industry. To save ourselves.”\n\n> The 2008 recession hit the black banking sector especially hard, and if the current rate of closures of about two a year, as well as the industry-wide reluctance or inability to start banks, continues, black-owned banks could disappear entirely within the next eight to 12 years.\n\n> The trend is worrisome to some analysts who argue fewer banks serving low-income, minority groups could expand “financial deserts”—communities with few or no banking institutions—and increase the likelihood that black and Hispanic communities could become susceptible to redlining, a discriminatory practice that excludes poorer minority areas from financial services.\n\n> “These banks are banks that serve relatively poor neighborhoods,” said Russell Kashian, an economics professor who studies black-owned banks. “There are neighborhoods that if…the black-owned bank isn’t there, nobody is there.”\n\n> Most black-owned banks typically have a few branches in one city, although one of the category’s largest players, New Orleans-based Liberty Bank, has a multistate presence. Such banks comprise just a sliver of the overall U.S. financial sector, with collective assets of $5.5 billion, versus $16.3 trillion in the industry overall.\n\n> As a result, some economists question the significance of the sector’s decline. “Size-wise they’ve been small,” said Nicholas Lash, a business professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies minority banking. “So their total impact on black communities can’t be very, very large.”\n\n> Yet those who live in communities that have been served by black-owned banks say the impact there, both practical and psychological, is deeply felt. The most recent example is in Chicago, where Illinois state regulators in January closed Seaway Bank & Trust, determining that its financial health had so deteriorated that pumping in more money couldn’t save it.\n\n> “It was like air coming out of a balloon,” said Bob Fioretti, a former Chicago alderman who was previously involved in raising money to keep Seaway open. “People were deflated. Seaway was a standing icon of the community.”\n\n> Seaway, formerly Chicago’s largest black-owned bank, helped anchor the famed black business community on the city’s South Side.\n\n> Claire Adams, a former board president of a South Side Chicago housing community that was one of the first businesses to use Seaway when it opened in 1965, said she now fears that with fewer small, community banks in her part of the city, payday lenders and check-cashing institutions, which often charge exorbitant rates and fees, would be many African-Americans’ only nearby banking option.\n\n> “The only thing that’s left are these predatory institutions,” Ms. Adams said.\n\n> In some areas of the South Side, Seaway was the first bank some African-Americans had access to, making it a symbol of black enterprise and economic development, patrons say. Many speak of the bank with admiration, often mentioning a program that allowed children to open a bank account with a small amount of money.\n\n> “I [could go to] Chase or something…but I like Seaway,” said Nell Robinson, who has used Seaway for more than two decades. “Seaway was here before Chase. It’s a black bank [and], we have to pull our people up.”\n\n> With such concerns in mind, members of the South Side’s religious community raised more than $100,000 in deposits for Seaway in 2016. But the effort wasn’t enough. Seaway was sold to the State Bank of Texas, then sold again to North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union.\n\n> A prolonged period of low interest rates and intense competition, as bigger banks slowly move into underserved areas, have combined to contribute to the black banking sector’s decline, even after the recession’s end. Now a practical concern in Chicago and elsewhere is that, even if bigger institutions step in, they won’t be as accommodating in lending to black-owned businesses.\n\n> A survey of entrepreneurs by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014 found that 47% of black business owners had gotten the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites.\n\n> That survey also showed fear of rejection was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek needed capital at all.\n\n> “When I have an applicant that comes into my bank and comes into XYZ large bank, and they’re on the edges, there are things that I can understand and appreciate about their situation that XYZ large bank won’t, and that makes the difference,” Mr. Mitchell, of Industrial Bank, said.\n\nI feel like we have to do whatever we can to keep these financial institutions alive man. Some of these banks & credit unions have been serving us and our communities since before integration. No way we should let them down now by continuing to take our business to people who don't care about or respect us. \n\nI have an account w/ Industrial Bank here in DC which is black owned in fact it was my very first bank account ever. My parents are the reason for this, and I'm proud to say I still do business with them to this day.",

I was marketing and communications manager for a nonprofit with a staff of 11. I did social media, desktop publishing, graphic design, web, light IT, anything to do with marketing. The new black female ceo came in and harassed me about everything she could take issue with like being \"intimidating\" because I'm tall. \n\n\nAfter three years of exemplary performance under the previous ceo they eventually fired me for leaving work 15 minutes early and called it \"job abandonment\" and denied me unemployment and hired a female to replace me. She lasted a few months since she couldn't do the job and they hired another woman I went to school with who was totally incompetent. \n\n\nI tried to get out before the fired me since I knew they were trying to pressure me out. I interviewed for a similar position at the nearby university but they hired one of my boss's middle age Hispanic female colleagues over me and the black female who interviewed me told my boss I interviewed for the spot. The Hispanic female they hired instead of hiring me called me a week later to ask me \"how to do what I do.\" Of course there was no reason for me to teach her how to do a job she should have known how to do to get hired in the first place nor could I teach her in a phone conversation what took me years of work and study to learn. They fired me about a week later. \n\n\nIncidentally I set up my email to forward to the new ceo before I was removed from the system after asking on my way out if they wanted me to do that as we had with other employees who had quit and they said yes then the new ceo called the police because I was \"harassing her\" with thousands of emails...from a company account I was not in control of that was set up to forward under her instructions. Because of my job I handled dozens of accounts for various platforms and software and got probably 100 emails a day, like analytics reports and such.

    "text": "Just watched The Red Pill, here's some random thoughts First and foremost, it was an incredibly intelligent yet *mild* look at both pro and anti MRAs. In the end, she stayed level headed, gave us a summary, concluded her topics and said she's not a feminist anymore. A total Streisand Effect, thanks to the protests, who led us to believe that this is hate speech. I expected to be shocked. I expected a Michael Moore style of biased editing from the filmmaker. I expected a big, mean slant against feminists. But nope, she gave both sides a chance, and all we got were mental gymnastics from our critics. \n\nThings you should know about this documentary, if you haven't seen it yet: She focuses on a handful of pioneers for men's rights and sticks mostly with them, while bringing in other interviewees. Some of the primaries: The guy from A Voice for Men; Warren Farrell; a guy from the National Coalition for Men; an ex writer for Playboy who lost his son in family court, and a British woman who started the first women's shelter in Britain and was later ostracized for being critical. Plenty others that I'm forgetting.\n\nAs for the rest of the interviewees: I loved the chillness of Girlwriteswhat at the bar and was glad to see her in this doc, although I wish she would've dressed a little nicer. The CEO of Ms. Magazine seemed smart and level headed, despite being a huge critic. Her focus is obviously on women, and that's fine. I simply wish her agenda would leave men alone, which it obviously doesn't. Those sociology and gender studies professors she interviewed were completely barfy.\n\nHey Big Red, how many times can you blame the patriarchy for everything wrong in your life? Do you know who you sound like? Black culture in the 90s that would blame \"the Man\" for keeping them down. But I see that you two have teamed up to blame white privilege and the patriarchy now. Smart thinking. Speaking of Big Red, even in a relaxed café setting, she stills comes off as bat shit crazy. \n\nI had to close my eyes during the circumcision scene.\n\nI was sooo so happy to see that she included that disgusting protest at the University of Toronto against Farrell's speech. I was on this sub when that happened, and I knew this event was getting us close to a tipping point against the misandry of Feminists and SJWs. Sadly, I noticed that some of the faces from the original vid were missing. That could be because she was pressed for time, but I think it was because they threatened legal action against YouTube and probably against Cassie too. That was another tipping point: When Feminists/SJWs realized that they're too chicken shit to come out from behind their computer and engage us in a rational manner.\n\nLastly, the video diaries were super duper important in conveying how she felt about this and how her aim was changing. Sometimes docs need a human element, and that's what she did. Without these logs, I think the doc would've lost a lot of its strength, and I'm gonna go ahead and say it: Having an attractive, blonde, white woman be the predominant face of men's rights in this film is the huge punch that we need.\n\nGood work, Cassie, and thank you very much for doing this!",

    "text": "A Day Without Men So I keep seeing news about women going on strike to show how invaluable their contributions are to the workplace, to society, to the economy, etc. \n\nI feel that the minds behind the strike didn't really think it through. \n\nWhen millions of people get through their day, have dinner, go to bed, and wake up tomorrow without being inconvenienced in the slightest by the women's strike all it will do is prove the opposite of the point they wanted to make.\n\nI am a supporter of equal rights for all, men, women, black, white, pink, purple, I don't care, equality for all means just that, for all, so please don't think I'm saying that I think, even for a second, that women are unimportant.\n\nBut imagine if we had a Day Without Men, a Men's Strike, a day when all the men in the country refused to work. Everything would fall apart. There'd be garbage piling up on the streets, public transport wouldn't be able to run, construction would grind to a halt, law enforcement would practically cease to exist, the military would do the same. What about slaughter houses that produce all the meat we eat? The kitchens filled with underpaid male immigrants? \n\nI'm sorry female Gizmodo writers, no one cares if you don't write for a day. The fact that you have the ability to not go to work for a day without everything going to shit exposes how expendable your position really is. All it does is highlight the dichotomy between true workplace equality and what all the third-wave feminists call equality. \n\nYes, gender inequality exists, I don't think it should, but historically it has. Men have been ahead in the game for millennia, but at the same time they have been stuck at the very back. Yes, more men hold CEO positions than women, but more men also hold the dirty, overlooked, under appreciated jobs that are the foundation that holds up the rest of society. \n\nThroughout history there have been examples of exemplary women who broke away from the norm and did huge things, who showed that women as a whole are not weak and can do great things. As we march ever forward into the future it is a truly great thing that more and more women are able to rise against any preconceptions that say they should stand by the sidelines of history. But I think it is too easily forgotten that the road that this march of progress, that this march towards equality for all treads  upon is paved with the bones of men.",

    "text": "[Discussion] My industry seems to be hiring and promoting women more due to historical injustice. How is this similar and different than affirmative action in colleges? I just wanted to have an open discussion with y'all so let's try and hold back our biases. I should mention I am for 100% equality but do not think you should create inequality to do so, I'll explain.\n\nMy field has predominantly been male and moved female over the last couple of decades. Now it's fairly even, but the leadership is still majority men, like 70%. I feel this is due to history taking a while to run it's course, as you see the new entrants are fairly equal. Except now I hear the CEO of a certain employer is stating they want more women in leadership. It was not an official statement online but something we heard directly. I'm all for women leaders. But I am concerned with men losing out to these opportunities as a result. \n\nI find this argument similar to that of affirmative action for college admissions. I have mixed feelings but there is no doubt that I, a white guy in a small yet affluent town, had a totally better set of opportunities than say a black woman a few towns over who grew up poorer, etc. I feel that children (18 and under) have little ability to change their opportunities, so AA can help give people an equal footing their parents couldn't. It shouldn't be a kids fault they grew up in a worse place than I did. I didn't do anything to be so lucky. \n\nBut when it comes to workplaces, more so the promotions than the hiring, I feel that it's extremely unequal to promote a woman over me simply because they're making up for past injustices. I feel that if you have a college degree like mine and have the same job as I do, we are on an equal playing field. The promotion should be based on merit and work alone. It hasn't happened to me in any way, but I am wary because I'm seeing what looks like signs of gender preference at work. For what it's worth, I work with 70-80% women and am in fact the only male on my 15-person team. I am the minority which is an odd feeling. Not complaining however. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

This whole situation sickens me because of how sexist and fucked up it is. I NEED to do SOMETHING about this. \n\n\nI am in a state that is pretty sexist and religious and therefore this school in question is too. I graduated last year but my whole experience was shitty because of the rampant sexism in this school that is brushed off by its sexist administration. Many of the rules (dress code) are sexist. We weren't even allowed to show our shoulders in school and would be horribly ostracized if someone thought we were wearing something \"inappropriate\". I once was told by the principal \"some battles aren't worth fighting\" when I was trying to discuss the sexism of the schools rules with him. \n\n\nGetting into the issue, a boy one year younger than me (he is an adult) raped a minor. He admitted this to the police saying that he didn't really thing she meant no, despite her saying no multiple times. He strangled her too and she was begging him to stop. He said he wouldn't until she had sex with him. (All of this information is from the article I'm not going to post it though since I'm sure that breaks privacy rules)\n\n\nHe paid bail and is now being allowed to go back to school. WHAT???? He is an adult and she is a child he raped her! How is this possible?? How is he not expelled or suspended?? Someone was expelled for getting caught with weed in my grade but rape isn't enough? As a female student you get sent home if you wear something \"immodest\" but a admitting rapist is allowed to be at school?? Many parents and female students are protesting but he principal is saying there is not proof.... EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITTED TO IT WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED TO THE POLICE! I don't understand? Am I overlooking something?\n\n\nI just hate that in my town girls safety is never taken into consideration and they let guys do what ever they want. I know so many guys that were in my grade that have raped girls at parties while they were black out drunk and the girls don't have the courage to speak up because nothing is done about it! And to make matters worse on social media this guy and his friends are saying that they just had sex and she regretted it afterwards and they are making rape jokes... I am just so disappointed in humanity right now. Please any advice??",

I talked to my class about it last week and reinforced what my expectations were, they agreed to try harder to be focused and respectful during class. This morning she complained again so I asked her which students specifically were giving her problems.\n\nShe called out the names of every black student in my class (I have 5) and nobody else. 2 of these students give me problems so I can understand if they were being difficult for her but the other 3 are usually pretty good.\n\nIt left me feeling weird and I wasn't sure how to handle it.

I'm apprehensive about this because the moral SHOULD be \"It was treated differently then, and this is a historical document\", but in all honesty, I wouldn't say it if I was reading the paragraph.\n\n* Option B - Tell them \"just skip the n word when you see it\" and not make a big deal about it. Remind them \"the n word is coming up, so please censor yourself\". I'm apprehensive about this because it sounds like I'm babying them and essentially saying \"you're not as mature as the book we're reading.\"\n\n* Option C - Let them decide in the moment.

I was completely miserable so I decided I needed a change. I went to consult an academic adviser at the local college about obtaining a teaching license. I had a bachelor's degree in political science, but I took night classes to get the prerequisites I needed for the program. When it came time to student teach I cashed in my 401k, my life's savings, I took out a loan so I could have enough money to live on while I basically worked an unpaid year long internship. \n\nI finally had what I needed. I got the license. I had a hell of a time finding my first job but I caught on with a rural school a couple weeks before school started. I moved an hour north, away from my family for the job. I worked like hell. It was in a rural district so I was pretty much on an island, but I did the best job I could and was respected by my colleagues. \n\nI worked there for three years, and completely out of the blue my principal, who I thought I had a good working relationship tells me I'm being non-renewed. He suggests I resign so I don't have a black mark on my record. \n\nI get my references in order, I have three years of experience and effective ratings, it should be easier now to find a job than it was three years ago right? \n\nI've applied for every open high school job since May. I've had two interviews. One in May... and one just this morning. School starts next week and they're scrambling. It looks like an amazing fit. I killed the interview, I thought I had this job in the bag...\n\nNope, I just got called and told that they went another direction.\n\nI've poured my heart and soul into teaching, and it's gotten me nowhere. Unemployed and my last check comes in 11 days. I have less than $700 in savings, and in heavy debt and my wife is a preschool teacher, so it's impossible for her to carry our household finances on her own. I feel like this interview was my absolute last chance to stay in teaching. For the last few months, with no teaching interviews I've applied for every job on Indeed I'm even remotely qualified for. \n\nMy lease lasts until next May (signed days before the unexpected non-renewal) and I don't think I can even make rent for one extra month on my meager savings. \n\nI could literally cry right now, I'm at the end of my rope and have no idea what to do.",

    "text": "Hit a new low today It has been a struggle this year, to say the least.  Today was especially terrible, for several reasons.  My toughest group arrived to the gym completely out of control. Diving down the stairs, crawling on the floor, shouting in the halls, and blatantly disregarding all attempts by peers and myself to gain control and behave.  It took 22 minutes for the class to stop this nonsense and enter the gym.  Once they got in the gym they went bananas. I sent them back into the hall, told hem my expectations, and let them back in.  Again, total chaos.  Back to the hall we went, and I explained the expectations again.  We finally made it inside and STRUGGLED through attendance.  One student in particular was way over the top so I had administration remove him from the class.  \n\nI am so beyond myself with this class, I straight up asked them what it would take for them to respect me and to behave themselves.  What followed was the most disheartening question and answer I have ever heard.  The overarching answers were that they would only listen to their Dean, who is essentially the middle school principal.  They told me she is he only one they listen to when given directions.  They told me the only way they would stop interrupting was if they were all put in rows and made to sit out of reach from another person so they wouldn’t be distracted. And the worst answer, that most of class all agreed on was this: one student told me I need to “act black, and yell at us”.  She said that was the only way she would follow my directions.  I asked her to clarify what she meant, and she said black people yell at you and that’s how you can get us to follow directions. The other students, black and white, nodded and agreed. How unbelievably sad is that? These students literally feel that they should be yelled at.  I can only attribute this attitude to the dean.  She is a black woman, and she yells at them.  I have never experienced so little respect for adults by children.  These kids are 10 and 11 years old.  I’m meeting with my principal tomorrow and will discuss this with her.

    "text": "Got fired for a miscommunication about my knees. How do I cope? Let me give some background since I'm also conflicted with the reason and would possibly like some sort of resolution or assurance.\n\n   This happened about 6 hours ago when I arrived at my workplace. Noticed my managers car was there and thought, \"Neat! I can say hi.\" When I go to the back room he has me to close the door and tells me that someone filed a complaint to corporate about me, and that I was being terminated with no warning and no prior infringements. Taken aback I sat next to my boss and asked what happened.\n\n   During work hours on Black Friday I was caught by a customer, from their description saying, \"I'm down on my knees all day, *very sexually*\". Immediately I told my boss that it was pain/exhaustion related from crouching and walking constantly around the store, to which he thought was exactly what context I would have used. Problem is that my co-workers and I are very close and will joke around. When I said my statement I had said it in a serious tone to which one of my colleagues said, \"Whoa!\" in a very humorous tone. I defended myself awkwardly for the next 15 seconds but apparently that was enough.\n\n   I physically couldn't believe it and immediately started crying. Now I may be a tough man but the workplace I had was a place of comfort and wonderful colleagues (I worked at a game store and the subject was a part of my life that I enjoyed waking up for). I sat with my boss and we talked for a bit until I could legibly sign my termination form. After signing I mentioned the exchange between myself and coworkers that had been the likely cause of the complaint. My boss had no idea and told me that it could be useful information.\n\n   The thing is that I told him not to tell anyone. Other than my colleagues so that they can get a second chance. I would rather myself fall before anyone else.\n\n   So this is where I need advice in the situation. The logical thoughts are telling me that I'm in the wrong while the emotional thoughts are telling me that it's okay. I'm very conflicted and have no clue what to do from here on out, whether I'm a bad person or wrongfully accused. \n\nTLDR: Got fired from the job that I loved for a miscommunicated remark about my bad knees. Super conflicted and need advice.\n\nEdit: changed some wording for clarity",

    "text": "Job Hunting Tips/Considerations from a Recent Grad I am a recent grad who spent over half a year to find my first full-time job (Tech Consulting) and wanted to share some of my thoughts regarding recruiting for a new job in my context. I am a young professional and would like to see comments about how I can improve the following notes.\n\nApplications: 400+\nInterviews: 20+\n\n--\n\n**Job Hunting Tips**\n\n1.\t**Align your interests** – Explore and identify various careers and industries that interest you. This requires experience, research, or networking with other professionals. Additionally, bringing awareness to what you are NOT interested in is as important as knowing what truly excites you.\n\n2.\t**Recognize your value proposition** - View yourself as a brand and highlight the skills which you can sell to an organization to benefit their business operations (soft/technical skills). Distinguish yourself as the best fit candidate for a role by elaborating on your unique knowledge or experience.\n\n3.\t**Create a company database** - Develop a list of companies which peak your interest by researching their mission, values, business model, etc (LinkedIn.com, Glassdoor.com, Indeed.com). Then, organize the list appropriately to efficiently filter them during your application process.\n\n4.\t**Strategize your search** - Using job search engines such as Indeed.com and LinkedIn.com are great; however, these platforms often fail to retrieve numerous job postings! Therefore, by applying for job applications directly through company websites, you will have full coverage of the public job postings. As a result, you may have a higher probability to interview for positions which receive lower levels of public exposure.  Lastly, familiarize yourself with specific search terms relative to your interests such as the following: Associate, Entry-level, and Junior.\n\n5.\t**Take advantage of your network** - Once you familiarize yourself with a company and its respective job postings, distinguish whether you have connections to the organization through LinkedIn. Expressing your interests to a network of professionals already associated with the company and sharing job requisitions may enable you to directly reach out to hiring managers. However, acknowledge that a professional will only assist you given that he or she believes you are fit for the role, since your profile directly affects his or her reputation for future referrals!\n\n--\n\n**Important Considerations**\n\n1.\t**Don't close the door** - Apply for positions and companies above and below your ideal standard. It is possible that you may be interviewed for positions which you may feel are beyond your qualifications, but let the recruiters be the judge. Occasionally, recruiters forward resumes to other recruiters in the event that there is a job posting more suitable for your candidacy. Additionally, by participating numerous interviews, you will practice your interviewing skills and be more comfortable with the various processes.  \n\n2.\t**Preparation for perfection** - It is important that you practice your interview skills and be familiar with specific information regarding the company and the respective role. When interviewing, demonstrating your knowledge of the industry or company’s business operations will highlight your proactiveness as a candidate. \n \n3.\t**Reality vs Expectations** - It is important to be realistic with your expectations and capabilities when applying for a new job. Having high standards is important; however, be aware of the opportunity costs of chasing the ideal job. Thus, developing a timeline with milestones is a great way of keeping yourself accountable throughout the recruitment process.\n\n4.\t**A competitive pool** - You must acknowledge that each job posting potentially receives tens or hundreds of applications. Similar applicants may be applying for positions left and right each day; therefore, reflect upon your recruiting practices relative to the competitive pool.\n\n5.\t**Be persistent, not annoying** - When reaching out to a professional or recruiter, be certain that your tone expresses curiosity and excitement. Sometimes getting your foot in the door requires persistence and careful communication; however, be conscious of how you may be perceived on the other end.\n\n6.\t**Keep your calm** - After you have completed a step of the recruitment process and  are waiting for further instructions or information, try to focus your attention on other job opportunities. This is the time to be patient and allow the company to deliberate for further feedback. Remember, there is no harm to taking a break from applying to jobs and participating in various hobbies to momentarily clear your mind.\n\n7.\t**No written offer, no stopping** - Do NOT stop applying or participating in any recruitment process until you have received a documented offer. It is possible for an organization which has extended you a verbal offer to suddenly decide to rescind their invitation.\n\n8.\t**\"Resume Black Hole\"** - Applying for jobs may feel like countless hours of throwing your well written resume into a Black Hole. People often refer to recruiting as a “numbers game.” Although this may be a valid argument, it is probably still within your best interest to act strategically when on the job hunt. Lastly, searching for the next chapter of your career may be incredibly discouraging and upsetting; nevertheless, you must remain determined and gritty to succeed!",

    "text": "Fired from job today due to complete hearsay and \"attitude problems\". Need advice on what to do next. So I worked for a decent size retail company for the past 2.5 years.  Two days ago I got into a verbal and almost physical altercation with a fellow employee and as a result lost my job today.  This is how it happened...\n\nI mentioned over the radios we use that if they were bored or had nothing to do that they could help move some of the gifts and accessories from the back warehouse onto the floor and work them onto the shelves.  The employee in question finds me moving several cases of freight on top of a lift and starts talking up to me with her tone very rude and with attitude, claiming she isn't bored and has plenty to do.  I tell her to then go do those things and stop bothering me.  She mumbles something under her breath and walks away but that irks me so I mentioned how she is lazy and any chance she gets, she walks away from her register to do nothing.  She didn't like that very much and unleashes a tirade of insults at me and I tell her to shut up and go away.\n\nFast forward to a couple hours later...\n\nShe just happened to be in the break room when I go on break. There's also another employee in the break room as well.  I get my food out of the fridge and start heating it up.  I put my water bottle on the table and she immediately speaks up and claims that she is sitting there, in that same nasty tone and attitude the used before.  I look at her and she repeats herself.  I tell her, \"You need to calm the f down with that attitude of yours.\"  She then gets in my face and threatens me.  Claiming that she will \"beat my ass\".  I make her aware that we are at work and that wouldn't be a good idea, in which she says she doesn't care and will beat my ass regardless.  I told her I would like to see her try and then move past her to get my now done food being heated and walk out to go eat elsewhere.\n\nThe next day I get pulled into the office by the SM on duty who is covering for the real SM which is currently at a different store training managers.  She tells me that she has heard the cashiers side of the story and now wants mine.  I tell her everything.  She claims I'm leaving something out.  I ask her what she is talking about because I just told her everything that happened.  The SM on duty claims that someone overheard me say, \"Typical f***ing N word\"!!!  The cashier is black, yes, but I would never say that!\n\nI got pulled into the office today and terminated because of previous \"bad attitude\" and supposedly I used a derogatory term. I never did any such thing. It's not fair but it's not worth fighting either because it was terrible pay anyways and they treat their employees terribly.  I just want to be done with them completely.\n\nI am labeled as a no re-hire by the company and if I ever use them as a reference, they'll have to say as much.  My question is when updating my resume for new jobs, do I even include the 2.5 years I gave to this place? I want to because I learned a lot and gained useful skills with this company. I was promoted quickly and trained in many departments.  If I shouldn't include them in my resume, how do I explain a 2.5 year gap of employment?  I'm at a complete loss as to what to do now with no income to be heard of and I was already living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\nTL;DR - Got fired for something I didn't do and am now labeled as a no hire and can't use them as a reference.",

    "text": "CVS Interview, What just happened? About a week ago, my wife got a phone call from a very enthusiastic manager at CVS to interview as a pharmacist. She told her all these great goodies about the job and how she loves to work with new Graduates and her excitement over my wife's experiences. She said she is especially happy wifey has an RN degree too. She stated she is excited to see her and the interview will be more or less to determine if my wife is willing to hit the ground rolling aka (more of a formality).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few days later the district manager calls my wife apologizing about how enthusiastic the manager was stating that she skipped the normal interview process by calling her first, that he has to call and do a pre-interview and then assign her to a manager/region but she jumped the gun; so he has a lengthy interview with her and he is happy to go ahead with the onsite, saying in his career he has had only 10 candidates out of hundreds that had her dual degree. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday she went in for the interview, the manager sees my wife and my wife says her whole body language changed, warmness and excitement went out the window, just cold stoic conversations. The manager said she wanted someone with nursing experience, not someone who just went straight from nursing to college (?), the wife said she has over 4 years of working in various departments (per her resume). \nThe interviewer then said she is looking for specific skills (no elaboration), the wife said she has the basics related to the position from her rotations, and that the interviewer had been previously expressed preference of her being a new grad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe interviewer then went on to give her potential negatives on how involving the position is (things she knows) suggesting it might not be something she might want. The wife replied that she's more than up for it. \n\nThe interview ended with \"we will see if we want you for another onsite interview\". \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat hurt me the most is when my wife called me really depressed and almost in tears asking me if this went sideways because she was black? Her name sounds Japanese (we are African) and most time people are surprised that the name and voice do not match perceived appearance. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI refuse to believe that this is a reason, I just need help wrapping my head around all this. How did things go so sideways? I always tell my wife to add these people on LinkedIn so that there are no surprises. This is just gut wrenching sad. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:** Warm exciting phone interview goes cold on meeting my wife in person.",

    "text": "First day at first job and I need to know if I'm exaggerating on how bad it was First of all this place didn't even give me a schedule.\nWhen I came in, the girl who interviewed me told the owner that I was the new girl and he seemed annoyed and said \"I didn't know about this.\" \nNobody told me what to wear, and he asked me why I wasn't wearing a black shirt and pants and I said nobody told me to do that. \nThen everything was fine kind of. All of the girls I was working with except one and the manager were 16. The girl doing samples with me was giving me the weirdest attitude for no reason and taking over what I was told to. This 16 year old girl had her \"not boyfriend\" who was like 20 sitting in there most of the day and the manager was talking to him and they were both swearing and using slurs and calling stuff \"gay\" which I dont really care about generally but I felt like it was really inappropriate because this is like an expensive cafe type place and people were in there. I didn't really say much the entire time. The backroom (which was right next to the kitchen area) was like a long room that was like a foot wide with 400 nats flying around. \n\nThen at 7, for the next 3 hours, the manager and the were being literally inappropriate and annoying as hell. Especially because the 2 girls are under 18 and the manager is like 30. The manager was talking about how many guys she had dated and how many \"broke her heart\". Then they kept asking the one girl if that guy was her boyfriend and she kept saying \"HEZ NAWT MY BOIFRIEND!!!!\" which happened like 7 times. Then the manager was telling one of then that \"your first breakup, is gonna be, like, the worst thing EVER. like. Seriously. Like I've had my heart broken so many times. Every guy I date falls in love with me.\" And I was just thinking wtf is going on in here. Then the manager was telling the other one that when she is old enough she was gonna take her to a bar to get hit on.\n\n\nTHEN while we were closing, shit really made me want to get the fuck out asap. The dude whistled at the one girl while she had his back facing him and then the manager was like \"OOOOO NICE ASS LOOK AT HER ASS IN THOSE PANTS\". \nAnd then they started talking about this guy's dick. And THEN the manager was telling them (16 and 17 year olds) how she is \"in love\" with this guy and hes her \"soul mate\" but that she wants to go with this other guy and then they were telling her \"YA U NEED TO BREAK UP WITH HIM THEN GO FUCK (insertnamehere)\" and they talked about this for like an hour. Then the girl giving me an attitude was talking to one of them about HER boyfriend and how she was crying blah blah blah. \n\n\nI literally felt like I was in a all girl freshman classroom. \n\nAlso, one of them was saying how she will be covering someone's shift and working for 14 hours and said she hoped she would get paid overtime and the manager said nobody gets paid overtime. Nobody took a break, I don't think we get breaks. Nobody gave me a schedule. The manager told me earlier in the day she had to give me paperwork before she left. She went out for a cigarette and didn't come back in, so I didn't get the paperwork I needed. \nSo I literally dont even know when I'm supposed to go back or anything.\n\n\nWhile I was handing out samples, a girl actually came up to me and told me she worked here before and that she didn't understand how I could work there and shook her head and walked away.\nI have absolutely no idea if I should stay here. \n\n\nI need advice Reddit. What the heck is going on there!!",

    "text": "Casual racism ***** EDIT: Wow, this post got significantly more attention than I expected. Thanks for all the advice and support (and zealous arguments about when stores should and should not allow more customers inside). I will be reporting this employee, mainly because while I do believe that there was wrong on both sides (but thanks to all of you who clearly offer amazing customer service), and I should just get over it, there is something to be said about speaking out about these matters, especially when prior generations have not. Who knows if it makes a difference, but it seems to at least have sparked some discussion here. I'm not going to insist on his firing or other retribution, if they would even do so in the first place; I can totally understand if this guy had a bad day and needed to take it out on someone. But the company should know if a branch allowed an employee to scream at a customer and did not address it immediately.\n\nObviously there's a lot of overt racism in the US, and it's been at a head for a long time now. There is every day violence committed against blacks and Muslims, and the statistics are there to prove it. I'm glad we talk about that. I hope that we can also talk about how comments about one's English or consumption of domestic animals is destructive too. No need to rank racism; it's all bad. For those who asked why saying \"ni hao\" is frustrating, rude, and yes, racist--I speak English. Why are those people assuming that I don't? *****\n\n\nI apologize beforehand if this isn't the right forum, but I need a place to vent, and this subreddit has always been one of the more open ones on this site. I went home this past weekend while studying for Step 1, and my dad offered to drive me back to my apartment as I don't live too far from school. He really wanted to stop by Sam's Club to pick up some fruit for me to take back, and even though I didn't think it was worth the effort, especially since it was nearing closing time, I said okay, because it's nice when your parents want to be nice to you, you know? We got to Sam's Club literally a minute before it closed, and my dad rushed inside while I parked. I decided to just wait for him outside the doors and was standing there when the guy who checks receipts called me inside and asked me if I was with the person who had just run in. He then proceeded to berate me for my dad coming in at closing time. (Edit: I did in fact tell him we were just getting one thing, in English, for those saying I shouldn't have just walked away. But no one has time to be yelled at once you're trying to be reasonable.) I walked away because no one has time to deal with that, and as I was walking away, he said, \"Maybe if I speak your language, ni hao ni hao, you’ll understand.\" I went to the cash registers and asked for the supervisor. When I told her what had happened and what this man had said, he ran up from the doors and started screaming in my face about how I was \"lying on [him].\" He continued to yell that I was lying (honestly if I were going to lie, I would have come up something slightly more creative). The manager said he was just trying to do his job.\n\nI was so frustrated and upset, and I continue to be despite sleeping on it. My dad does not want me to report this person because my dad is a good person and at about the zenith of non-confrontational, and he doesn't think this employee should be at risk for losing his job. But for me, not saying anything feels like implicitly condoning this behavior. Yes, we were in the wrong for entering this store at closing time--that one pack of strawberries better be the best I've ever had--but that didn’t justify outright racism and aggression. I don't know how many times I have heard \"ni hao\" as an insult/pick-up line/greeting and how many times I have been congratulated on not having an accent. I have been followed down the street and called a cunt because I told a stranger that addressing me with \"ni hao\" was impolite. I know this is something that people of color confront on a daily basis and that we are meant to speak out when it happens, but… it's hard, guys. Racism directed at Asians and Asian-Americans in particular seems like the last bastion of racism in comedy (see: Steve Harvey), the last and most insidious form of undercutting a whole group of people. It feels like no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I dedicate my professional (and whatever is left of my personal) life to trying to take care of people, how much my parents have sacrificed, that I can be leveled with the basest of insults.",

    "text": "Xenophobic-ish comments from a minority patient . Not sure how to feel about this. Background: I work in a city hospital that serves a very impoverished minority population . Our Institution isn't exactly stellar  , so except for Radiology and Surgery most of our residents and staff are FMGs or IMGs.  Me (FMG) and my posse ( Mostly FMGs)were doing our rounds. Being a Sunday , out team was providing cross-coverage and we had a lot of patients to round on. \n\nWe make to the ED to examine a patient who had come in with shortness of breath and  diagnosed with a PE. The patient was a black transgender patient. She had been in the ED for a couple of hours \n\nThe moment I stepped in the room my spidey-sense started tingling. Started off rough enough \" who are you ? why Are you here ? Why are  you rounding so late?.I'm short of breath\" ( while screaming at the top of her lungs).  Ma'am . I had 30 patients. i needed to prioritize , but you have my attention now . \n\nShe explained that she was basically ignored by the nurse ( which was true - was not hooked up to telemetry or SO2 monitoring ).\nI apologized to her and told her I would talk to the nurse and that she should take it up the charge nurse. So far nothing usual. \nThen she went off on a tirade  .\" My mother worked in this hospital ,I also worked in healthcare . Used to come here sometimes until I started getting my care in  *Brand name * Hospital . This hospital was  much better run when we had Real American Doctors, not all these foreign doctors.\" She repeats this stament verbatim again during the course of the encounter. \n\nNow my interns and resident are visibly disturbed. But she goes on . About how her usual hospital is much better.  I then remind her BTW, I'm also foreign ( my phenotypic  ethnicity is ambiguous- on a good day I can pass off for Hispanic/Italian . I was called \" white trash \" once ).\n\nIn order to diffuse the situation , I agree with all her comments. I  put in a few negative comments about my own hospital( I find this works very  well to calm down a an angry patient/family )  This eventually calms her down , and I manage to get a coherent history and physical exam.\n \nBy the end of the encounter I tell her \" Ma'am, I'm sorry you couldn't get a real american doctor today \". She then suddenly becomes apologetic.  \"Oh, I didn't  mean all foreign doctors are bad . Just like the cops you have good ones and bad ones  . You all have been very professional . \"\n\nI shake her hand and the encounter ends.\n\nI don't know how to feel about all this. My training tells me that the outburst was probably a reaction to the stress of being in a hospital and mistreatment by the ED nurse. She did apologize in the end ( cant vouch for the sincerity of it  though ) . She herself belongs to a very marginalized group ( Black M-to-F transgender ) but had no qualms or second thoughts about espousing xenophobic comments.  \n\n Throughout  my training I've been on the receiving end of irate patients .But this encounter left an especially bad taste in my mouth. I guess the fear of \"the others \" is a very primal urge. And all these civilities are just veneers on a underlying tribal  mindset. \n\nAt least I can watch the WWE Summer Slam tonight and get my mind off this .\n\nAnyone else here had similar experiences ? How would you debrief your residents/interns ?",

    "text": "I had a psychotic breakdown at work This will be a very long post. But I feel like it's worth reading. As fellow nurses, you all know that we stretch ourselves too thin. We work long hours. We have stressful shifts. We push our bodies and our minds over and over again. For our patients. For our coworkers. For our families. We all know that we should take care of ourselves. We all know we should eat better, exercise more, drink less. Stop saying yes to picking up extra shifts. Stop going without sleep so we can spend time with our friends and families on our off days. Of course we know all that. But we're nurses, it's just what our life is like. So we keep going. Until we break. This is my story about my break.\n\nI had worked 3 night shifts in a row. Nothing new. I've always worked nights. I hadn't slept well at all, also not new. I've been taking meds for insomnia for about 5 years. I was on call from 2300-0700 for night number 4. I had got somebody to cover the first 4 hours of my call because I wanted to go to a mystery theater dinner thing. The day after shift 3 I didn't sleep. At all. Just could not fall asleep, even with drugs.  I should have skipped the dinner and tried harder to get some sleep. But I was really looking forward to it so I got up an I went. And then of course I got a text saying they would need me at 2300. I was already so tired, my eyes were burning and my face was flushed. I was over emotional already. But they needed me so I had to go. \n\nI work in L&D. I've been at this unit for about a year. Before this I worked step down. I'm pretty comfortable in L&D now. Still haven't encountered a lot of things but for the most part I'm confident in my skills. When I get to work the unit is slammed. And there are 2 triages that had just come in that my charge nurse gives me. Both are rule out labor. As soon as I start working I realize I'm kind of off. I go to the supply room for something and totally forget what. I stare at a fetal strip forever before being able to analyze it. I forget where to go in our charting system to get to certain things. One of the triages is fine, going to be discharged. The other is 38 weeks and having contractions every 2-7 minutes. Her cervix is 2/60/-2. Her doctor happens to be on the unit for another delivery so I let her hang out on the monitors to wait to see what the doctor wants to do. So I start working on discharging the other patient. About half an hour or so later I've discharged the other patient and the MD gets out of the other delivery. She looks at the strip and says \"She's having lates. Why haven't you admitted her?\" I look at her strip (even though I'd been checking it regularly and it looked okay) and see she HAS been having deceleration. Go in the room and patient is obviously in pain. Recheck her she's 4/80/-1. I try to get an IV so I can start her bolus for an epidural. I'm flustered and scared, I have the volume on the monitor up and I can hear baby's heart rate keeps dipping. I can't get the IV. I go to get some help. The other nurse gets the IV quickly and I start a bolus, turn the patient to the left and put her on some oxygen. Strip still looks iffy but I just can't really get a good picture of what's going on. I don't know what to do. So I go out to the nurse's station and ask somebody else to take a look at it. \"Oh yeah, looks like she started having variables here. And then they turn into lates here. And now her variability is minimal.\" I start crying. It was like a faucet got turned on. I can not calm myself down and stop crying. Everybody surrounds me and keeps asking me \"How can I help you? What can I do?\" And I can't even think straight to know what to ask them to do. So my charge nurse switches around assignments and I give the labor patient away and get some post partum patients instead.\n\nThe next few hours are horrible. I keep crying randomly, my eyes are so swollen and my face is red. I can't concentrate on anything. I'm having a hard time keeping up with which patient needs what. All the nurses keep looking at me like \"You poor thing\" and being overly sugary and sweet towards me. \n\nAround 0530 thing start getting worse. I was looking at a nurse telling her something about the labor patient I had and I thought that I saw her eyes dilating and then contracting back. I kept staring straight into her eyes. I would tilt my head to left and then back to center over and over, all while looking into their eyes and seeing them dilate and contract over and over. I snapped out of it after about thirty seconds and was terrified. The nurse was obviously a little freaked out and kept asking if I was okay. I tried to shake it off and kept telling myself the shift was almost over. I'd be able to sleep soon. But then it happened again. My heart was pounding and I started hyperventilating. At this point all of the nurses are very worried about me. My charge nurse talks me into going to the ER. I try to call my boyfriend as my charge nurse walks me down to the ER but he doesn't pick up. Once in the ER ever person I interact with I think is in this little \"trance\" where their eyes glass over and dilate while I stare. I start to think that I'm somehow infecting these people when I look at them and making them go into a trance.\n\nThe get me back to triage quickly. My HR and BP are through the roof. I can hardly talk at this point. I'm trying to explain how I'm feeling to the triage nurse but every time I look at him he starts going into this trance. I really start panicking at this time. I keep telling the triage nurse to get help because I'm making him sick. I keep going over ACLS steps in my head because I think that either I'm about to code or this triage nurse is. My boyfriend calls me back at this point and I tell him to get to the ER because I feel like I'm coding. \n\nThey get me back to a room. Every single person that comes in I think is in this trance. They seem like they're walking slow and moving slow. Their eyes are glazed, pupils dilated. Speech is slow. The nurse and doctor step out at one point and I press the code blue button in the room because I'm certain I'm dying. My heart is racing, my chest is tight, I'm dizzy. And I see all these people in trances and I know I'm going to code and there will be nobody there to help me. I keep snapping in everybody's faces in hopes they will wake up. I'm screaming and crying. \n\nMy boyfriend shows up around this time. I look at him and even HE goes into this trance. I hit him in the chest trying to wake him up. I keep telling him I love him so much and that I'm sorry. I tell him he doesn't have a pulse and I'm so sorry that I've made everybody sick because nobody can help him. There are several nurses and techs and they're trying to hold me down and I'm fighting them. Hard. They try to get an IV but I'm moving too much. They then roll me to the side to give me an IM injection (Benadryl and Ativan). I'm screaming and fighting them because I don't understand what's going on and I think they're giving me something to kill me (because I'm making everybody go into this trance.) I get away from them and get off the stretcher. There are people in and out of the room constantly. They're trying to talk me down. At one point when there is nobody in the room and I sit against the door and try to barricade people from coming in. I manage to get my cell phone and I call 911. I tell them that everybody at my hospital is in a trance and they're trying to kill me. My boyfriend gets the phone from me and is trying his best to calm me down. I keep trying to drag him out of the room (I was trying to get out of the hospital because I thought 911 would be sending EMS). \n\nI start feeling weak and strange. I think that I'm starting to die from the injection they gave me. They're trying to get me back on the stretcher and into wrist restraints. I'm biting and kicking at this point. They try to put paper scrubs on me (I had taken my scrubs off by this point..dunno why). I think they're trying to put a hood over my head so I won't see when they kill me. They give me another injection (Haldol). I'm still trying to get up. Finally all the drugs start hitting me. I'm certain I'm slowly dying at this point. They tell me I've been PEC'd and start explaining things to my boyfriend. I think it's weird that they would bother with a PEC since they tried to kill me. I start feeling very drowsy and weak. They make my boyfriend leave the room since I'm PEC'd. He tells me he'll be back at 1300 for visiting hours. I told him \"Fine, but I'll be dead by then.\" The nurses slowly filter out as it becomes obvious that I won't need to be held down anymore. The leave a sitter in the room that looks terrified. I drifted in and out, at this point I have accepted the fact that I'm going to die and I'm just glad I'm going to be able to sleep. \n\nI sleep a bit on and off and slowly start coming to my senses. I realize I'm not going to die. I start getting scared that I've been PEC'd. My boyfriend comes back and I get him to tell me his side of things. Later that afternoon EMS come to transport me to a psych facility. By that time I'm pretty much back to my baseline. \n\nThe psych facility terrifies me. I'm on a general adult psychiatric ward. The first person to talk to me was a schizophrenic patient that was telling me that I was his daughter and was yelling at me because I took the elevator when he had told me to take the stairs. What in the fuck? I do not belong here. They start me on new meds for sleep (Seroquel). I sleep like a baby and feel fine other then being anxious about being in a psych ward. I think surely they'll let me go home after reviewing the PEC. I'm not a harm to myself or others, I'm not suicidal, I'm not depressed, I'm no hallucinating. Nope. I was there for 9 day. I don't know whether they held me so long because I was a nurse and they wanted to insure I was safe to go back to work. Or maybe because I had good insurance. I saw patients that were in for suicide attempts and active hallucinations leave before me. All medicaid patients. As a nurse, it was definitely enlightening to see this world from a patient side. I now have a very very negative view of short term inpatient psychiatric care. Now this could have been a bad example of typical units. I could write a book. Hell maybe I should.\n\nAnyway. I'm back to work now. Still on nights because I can't find an L&D day position. Thankfully we self scheduled on my unit so I've been able to make sure I don't work more than 3 shifts in a row. The Seroquel is helping with sleep, but I have already had to go up on the dosage for it to be effective. I'm terrified every time I work that I won't be able to sleep. I'm terrified that this will happened again. I never got an official diagnosis but I assume it was a severe panic attack with psychotic features. A small part of me wonders what if this was just a precursor to some psychological illness. All of the nurses on my unit have been so supportive. I still get weirded out at work sometimes, deja vu and what not. I still hate having patients in the room that that labor patient was in. I still feel weird around the nurses that were there that night. It was a terrible experience, I still remember most of it so vividly. The delusion of everybody being in a trance still seems so so realistic to me. I've talked to so many people about how it looked from an outside perspective. I wish I could understand exactly what happened. It's awful to have your mind betray you.\n\nThank you for anybody that read. It feels good to see all of this down in black and white. And please, take my experience as a warning. You are not invincible. You can not keep running your body into the ground. One day your body and mind will say \"Enough.\"",

    "text": "Manager called me unprofessional Hey everyone, i'm curious to see what everyone's response will be.\n\nI recently got a coveted position at a great hospital in my region. When I was informed they wanted to hire me they gave me a start date 2.5 weeks away. As soon as I received my offer letter I put in my two weeks via email as I am a night shifter and planned on talking to my manager about it when I saw her. Before I could get a chance to talk to her, she left me a nasty voicemail calling me unprofessional for not resigning in person and told me she would 'hold' my resignation till I called her. Yeah. I didn't call her back right away because I honestly didn't know what I would say and was kind of flabbergasted by the voicemail. I work the weekend shift and she comes in that next Monday morning and corners me right before shift change in front of my peers in the middle of the pod and berates me for not calling her back, calls me unprofessional to my face and then makes mention of a comment a friend of mine made on my facebook about the unit. This lady does not have me on facebook. The place I am working at has been driven into the ground by this manager, 70% of people aren't making it through orientation because they quit and since I started almost two years ago 70% of the original staff has quit.\n\nI kind of want to contact HR and her director and let them know what went down. I'm pretty sure there is already an HR investigation against her because they are trying to figure out why people are quitting. What would you all do? I'm worried she might try to black list me somehow. \n\nEdit; My friend who commented on my status was a former coworker who congratulated me on getting out of the 'crap shoot.'",

    "text": "Making work friends? Something that has really been bothering me lately is that I don't feel like I am friends with anyone from work. There is 1 person that I hang out with *occasionally* (as in like once every few months) and that is it. I try to be social, invite people out places, try to include myself in plans, attend work-organized social events, etc. But I never get the effort returned. I am never included on people's plans, I am never invited out.. Nothing. Even when they are sitting and making the plans right in front of me. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm still kind of new (1 year)...but there are people who have been there less time than I that get invited out. Maybe it's because I'm a guy in a female dominated profession. Maybe it's because I work swing shift. Maybe it's because I'm white and working in a predominantly black hospital. Maybe everyone just fucking hates me. I honestly don't know. Most people seem to enjoy working with me and seem to like me at work.\n\nThis is something I've dealt with my whole life. I've never felt included on plans (barring a small group of really close friends) and always feel like an outsider. I'm so fucking miserable and lonely. It's making it really hard to go to work because people sit around and talk about the last time they all went out. They all post pictures of shit I wasn't invited to on Facebook. They make plans right in front of my face and don't even bother to ask if I want to come out with them. \n\nI think I am going to ask my manager to switch me to night shift (although I am TERRIFIED of working nights) because they seem like the stronger team and they all seem closer outside of work compared to days and especially swing shift. Any other suggestions?\n\nP.S. sorry about the rant.",

    "text": "How does your company manage R&D/Prototype Projects? Hello fellow reddit engineers. I am a mechanical engineer with a couple years experience in industry working in design with two separate companies. I've done 3-4 large prototype projects with varying degrees of complexity and varying degrees of disorganization. I've found what works for me to manage projects and keep a team moving forward but I'm really curious how the rest of you keep your projects, large or small, organized and documented. Specifically I wondered;\n\n - Assuming you have a concept that you are relatively sure will work, do you run a prototype through your ERP/MRP system? Do you have a separate database for engineering projects or do you create part numbers, BOM, etc in the production instance?\n\n - If you work outside of the ERP/MRP system how do you maintain tracking, costing, BOM, and inventory? \n\n - When in the project do you attempt to capture your cost rollup? When does this consideration come into play for your design process?\n\nI know that there is no real black and white answer as it varies so much with the scope of the project. I'm just curious to everyone else's experience. Thanks so much for your ideas!\n\nTLDR; How do you manage your prototype projects so there isn't complete chaos but you still aren't bogged down in paperwork?",

    "text": "[PA] [11/12] - Having a terrible student teaching experience. Advice please **TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue. Now I'm facing two serious conversations with my school in less than a week span trying to find a resolution to move forward.**\n\nI am at a AA-sized school in western PA outside of the city. When I was first assigned to this school I was excited as the mentor teacher had received some awards and plaudits both statewide and even a national one. I thought \"what better person to learn from that this person\".\n\nWhen we first started it was going great. She was excellent at teaching me the ins and outs of contracts, etc (which I realize now was totally off-topic and shouldn't have even come up), the mechanics of school politics (again, some bells going off) and so forth.\n\nDuring the first week, I could see how she was a really good teacher. The kids respect her and she has great classroom management. On Tuesday of the first week, she said she would want me to start teaching the following week. So she would take the first Econ class of the day and I would teach the two in the afternoon. She wanted me to start drafting lesson plans for these days and then we'd go over them on Friday.\n\nThe first week of doing Econ in the afternoon went well, so she had me take over that class full time in Week 3, while I took over the second of her two Psych/Soc classes in the same format. In Week 4, it was all me for everything.\n\nWhile I was excited to jump into teaching full time, I should have had a few alarm bells going off:\n\n* why wasn't she modeling her preferred style of lesson planning to me?\n* why was she moving faster than my university's suggested timetable for giving me more responsibility?\n* how was I going to be expected to extrapolate from her incredibly abridged lesson plans?\n\nI took comfort in the fact that, at the beginning, she would sit down with me and go over what she would expect to me to cover the next week and so forth M-F. And it became our ritual, in a sense, for us to sort of broadly go over the next week on Friday and then for me to turn in an overview of the week by Sunday, which she would comment on if there were any concerns.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. She is busy on Friday with students asking about extracurricular stuff and my attempts to connect on the following week's material are rebuffed. So I do my best on Friday evening and Saturday to map out the week, extrapolating from a very thinly detailed syllabus to try to use as a pacing guide. I text her on Saturday evening asking if we could go over the plans for the week, and she responds \"I'm busy right now, I'll call you tomorrow at 5\". (bear in mind, she told me from day one that if I EVER need help to call and she'll \"talk me down from the ledge\" and work with me\".\n\nThe next day, I reach out by email ahead of time, sort of detailing all of my concerns about the upcoming week, my confusion over the pacing and wording in the syllabus and uncertainty as to her suggestions from the past. \n\nThen 5 comes and I get no response, then 7, then 9 - and by this point I'm freaking-the-fuck out. So I send another follow up text stating that I had sent an email with some questions and I was hoping to discuss the following day, at least, as well as the week moving forward.\n\nI get a text at 11:30 pm asking \"have you figured it out yet\". To which I of course responded no and that I thought i at least had a plan for the next day but that I really needed some clarification on the rest of the week. She responded \"**i can keep holding your hand forever, but you'll never learn anything that way. I need those lesson plans before 7 tomorrow. See you then**\n\nSo when she came in the door in the morning, I was hastily wrapping up the weekly overview lesson plan to be turned into the office - basically just going off of whatever she did last year.\n\nThen all week long, there was this tension in the classroom. I could feel it growing. I was frustrated with her for essentially abandoning me with little preparation (a strategy which many of my teacher friends derided as unprofessional and extremely unhelpful). She seemed annoyed with me for seemingly needing any help at this point.\n\nOn Wednesday, I get an email from the director of field placements at my university wanting to have a phone meeting the next day. On that phone meeting is literally everyone in the chain from the top of the school of education down to me. \n\nMy site director first allows me space to give my side, and then proceeds to list a rapsheet of complaints and errors on my part that have been privately communicated to her over the past week or two about my untimeliness in turning stuff in and unpreparedness for the day each day and needing to have my hand held for every little thing...yadda yadda.\n\nI was so taken aback and felt so cornered, but i swallowed my tears and the lump in my throat and did my best to give a fair account of everything from my end, to include - which I've yet to mention - that the previous week she broke her tooth in half and had 2 miss days of school in pain after getting it pulled and i was left with subs, etc. Then the following days she was in pain because she couldn't take her percocet before coming to school and so was always in a foul mood, but I did my best to steer clear, etc.\n\nThe school seemed understanding of my side, and said they aimed to support me in whatever way possible to help get me across the finish line.\n\nThen yesterday was teacher in-service. Teachers are supposed to be given an itinerary at least a week ahead of time. Our teachers were given them on Wednesday. My MT forwarded the email to me, but i notified her that as it was a Google doc, and she was not the creator, it wasn't able to be opened unless shared by the creator. She said she'd follow up, but never did.\n\nSo I arrive at 8 the on Friday morning, and go to meet her in the classroom, which is where we met previously. She's not there; door locked. I go to the auditorium, which is where in-service began last time, and no one is there. Finally I hear an announcement and see teachers walking toward the collaboration center, so I join them and we all walk in the door at 8. I get a text from her at 8:02 saying \"in-service started 2 minutes ago and you aren't here\". So i responded \"im here, in the back of the room\". She turns around and makes eye contact.\n\nLater in the day I get a call from my site director asking how the day is going, if I'm feeling any better after the ambush on the phone the day before, etc. Then she asks, what time did the in-service start this morning? I said, \"8\". \"And when did you arrive?\" \"just before 8\". \"Well, your mentor teacher sent me an email notifying me that you didn't arrive until 9\".\n\nI was PISSED. I forwarder her the texts proving that I was there at 8 and that I had notified my mentor teacher of my presence in the back of the room.\n\nI got ANOTHER call from the university and after some back and forth, they sort of seemed to agree with my suggestion that I felt that I was being sabotaged at this point for whatever reason. They said to not go into school on Monday, don't contact my mentor teacher, don't contact the school - they'll take care of it. What they want is to have a meeting where all the expectations of all parties are laid out in black and white, on paper, so there's no confusion, and then we'll figure out a path forward from there.\n\nI'm so frustrated and confused and exhausted and exasperated over the whole thing. I don't even know what to do going forward. I was told to not make any more lesson plans at this point and to just take the weekend to spend time with my kids and wife and think about some solutions to help get me across the finish line on December 8.\n\nI'm so furious I don't even know what to do. I'm also worried that my MT, if I remain in her classroom, is going to sabotage me by switching subjects this week to throw off any lesson planning I've already done (both classes are combined Psych/Soc and Gov/Econ) and we go back and forth. Everything I've planned for the rest of my time there is in Sociology and Gov, so I half expect to walk in the door tuesday and she'll have been teaching Psych and Econ and tell me to hurry up and make some lesson plans for the rest of the week.\n\nAnyway. Suggestions?\n\n**TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience.

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

I have been at this company for 1 year and almost 3 months because of a rotational program for the job I am in now.

I'm not going to say the name of the company but I work in the finance division of a major automobile company.

I am an INTP personality type to quickly sum up my personality.\nFirst, I have to be really good at small talking because this builds stronger relationships with the dealerships. I'm an reserved introvert, so I cannot make small talk to save my life and these are car salesman so I'm having to interact with the most extroverted peppy type A people this planet has to offer. If I don't do well in my conversations with the dealers then I get dinged on my performance.\nNext, the work is extremely repetitive and requires that emotional gray minded way of thinking. Decisioning a credit application isn't black or white and plus if I make a decision somebody doesn't like then I either have one of my 8 bosses yelling at me or an angry sales manager calling me. I can't listen to music at my job because I have constantly be ready for inbound phone calls or have to deal with small talk from my bosses.\nLast, getting promoted is not an option. I have to be at my job for at least 3 years before I can even be considered for promotion. In addition, they only promote the best performing people because they are natural fits for upper level positions in the company. Lets just say my job is like the gateway in to management or other specialized parts of the company. If you do not get promoted then you will most likely retire at my job. In addition, I have zero interests in those jobs above me because they are either more extroverted or repetitive than mine.\nIn conclusion, I have no idea what to do. I'm 24 I quit my first job after college after 7 months because I was in a desolate part of the country and the pay was terrible. Am I just broken and destined to fail? Sorry for any grammar mistakes because I was in a hurry to type this.",

    "text": "Looking for a job (after being out of steady work since October 2016) Why is it so hard to get (and keep a job) these days in Seattle?  I primarily work contract roles because that's mostly whats out there.  Getting a fulltime position seems nearly impossible!  The last few companies that interviewed and/or considered me for full time positions flaked on me (even some of the contract hiring managers have been flaking also).  What is the big deal with this area lately?\n\nI'm an experienced SDET/HW engineer with 7+ years of industry experience.  My resume speaks for itself, I have worked at Microsoft on contract multiple times, have a diverse set of skills (not just one) and does great work, but ever since October, it's like the market has just... dried up.  What's the deal here?\n\nLately, Microsoft has been actively opening new positions for the Surface and Azure team.  I had two interviews for the Surface team.  The feedback was that for one I was not as qualified as the other candidate, while the other one didn't specify (likely because I was overqualified).  I'm not being picky about salary or anything, or even where I work, but the software engineering and IT industry has never been stable for me, and I've never had a full time position in my entire life because they are so hard to come by and much harder to get considered for.\n\nI post my resume on monster, careerbuilder, indeed, etc. and just started using LinkedIn, hired.com, and a few more.  No success at all.  The prior years before have been much more successful.  2016 hasn't been a good financial year for me, ant 2017 is just abysmal.\nNothing, nothing, NOTHING!\n\nI'm not trying to complain here, but I'm amazed that I haven't been kicked out of my place yet.  I don't have money to buy food, pay for transportation, and debt just keeps piling up (thanks alot, my idiot ex girlfriend), so I feel like it's do or die at this point.  I even thought of committing suicide several times.  There just has to be a way out of this, right?\n\nOne of my ultimate goals is to get back into Microsoft, specifically on the Surface team.  I've been on the Surface Hub team before, and did an outstanding job with tools development and automation but ever since the budget cuts in 2016, things have just been downhill from there.\n\nIf you want to know my skillsets, here's some of the languages and technologies I've used.\n- Visual C++, Visual C#, Java, Objective-C, some Javascript, some Python\n- .Net frameworks, open source APIs for Linux and MacOS\n- Cross platform native app development for iOS, Android, Win10 (UWP) and Blackberry 10\n- Automation using Selenium Webdriver, TAEF, Eclipse\n- Xbox testing and development\n\nAnd that's just a basic summary of the things I've used and excelled at, and yet I STILL can't find anything this year!  Once again, I'm not trying to complain but I really don't know what to do anymore.  6+ months of seemingly non-stop job searching with next to no results makes me want to quit software engineering and do something else that's going to provide SOME sort of stability because what's the use of getting paid an upper 5 figure or 6 figure wage if you just keep getting laid off all the time??  It really does just seem hopeless.  And lastly, I'm not trying to play the race card or anything (because I don't use the \"white man got me down\" excuse) but is it because I'm black?  No really, I'm running out of ideas.  My resume used to get me tons of interviews.  Now, not so much...\n\nAny ideas or insights would be really appreciated.\n\nShogun",

    "text": "Is this a good response to the question \"tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager\"? My response to this is the following story:\n\nThere was a time about a year into my career when I was working on a project to convert a data feed from a mainframe process to a SQL stored procedure. The feed was sending data from our systems to another area of the company, and receiving a feed back and storing the data. It was a monthly feed.\n\nWe worked closely with our business partners to analyze the requirements and develop the stored procedures. In one of the feeds there was some ETL logic required that neither my manager nor I really had a good understanding of. We reached out to some other folks in our department and found that another BA (business analyst), who was previously a developer, had some SQL code that did almost exactly what we needed, we only had to change a few data sources and outputs. From what I can remember his code was joining several data sources and using a cursor to output a temporary table to be used later in the feed. We worked with him to get this logic into our feed and to try and understand what it was doing.\n\nWhen it came down to it though, my manager and I did not have a 100% understanding of what Mike's (the BA) code was doing. We knew it would work, Mike knew it would work, but even after stepping through the code and working with Mike are understanding of this portion was still lacking. Mike is a bit a white-beard and we knew we could trust him and that the code was solid though. \n\nMy manager wanted to move forward with this portion of the feed being a \"black box\". I didn't really like the idea of doing that and voiced my opinion. However, since I was junior at the time I didn't really have much of a say in the matter. Even my manager's manager was OK with doing this. Especially since we were in a bit of a time crunch.\n\nIn order to mitigate as much risk as possible I made sure to test this code 200%. I wasn't happy that we were doing this, since it was going to be our name's at the top of the SQL script and we were owning it, but at the end of the day there wasn't much I could do.",

Prompt which inspired me:https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5tdx45/wp_a_take_on_office_politics_with_a_game_of/\n\n\n\nThere are two types of people in this world. The nice guys ,the type of guys who wouldn’t hurt a fly. They keep their head down and they work. They abhor conflict in all forms and they are terrified of being unfair. Then there is the second kind, the kind of person who achieves what he wants. Which do you think I am?\nI am a senior manager in one of the top 4 accounting firms on the planet. Which one?As if I’d tell you. This isn’t my first rodeo. This is purely a work of fiction and any resemblance of characters to people living or dead is purely coincidental.\nI walked into my clients office at 8. The audit room faced a beach, an empty beach. That is the carrot and I am the stick. The room smelled of sweat and associate tears. I approach Johnson.\nJohnson is a twat. Be that as it may he’s next in line for manager and with the economy being what it is ,suffice it to say this firm isn’t big enough for the both of us.I missed the birth of my first child  for this company.I’ll be damned if I get thrown off the partner track by an overachieving, brown nosing upstart.\n“Excuse me?” \nShit  I think I said that out loud.\n“Johnson! Just the man I wanted to see”\n“Hello sir. Hows the family?”\nMy wife is a bitch and my kid doesn’t network enough\n“Oh couldn’t be better!And how about you?Hows the wife?”\n“Oh Janines pregnant”\nShit.Hope that’s not mine.\n“That’s fantastic Johnson. So about this assignment. It’s going to be a good learning experience for you”\nThat’s code for ‘You’re going to have a bad time’.He knows it and I know it.\n“Also I have given you Harold and Brenda.Two of my best people no less”\nHarold was indeed the best at getting the team coffee and I suspect Brenda has a burgeoning glue addiction.\n“If you say so Chad”\nThe sucker bought it! What did I tell you? Massive twat.\n“Excuse me?”\nShit I really should stop talking to myself.\n“Oh just talking to myself.You know how it is”\nJohnson gave me a symphathetic nod and went back to his laptop. With a severely underequipped team at his disposal,an inviting beach and a non-cooperative client, his rating will plummet. I have just enough pull with the partners to deny him his promotion if that happens.\nSo I banged his wife and stabbed him in the back.Some would pat themselves on the back and call it a day.But not I,I decided to put one final nail in the coffin;I was going to steal his sandwich.\n“Chad your wallet”\n“Huh?”\n“You’ve left you wallet”\n“Oh,thanks man” \nI went to the pantry and grabbed the lunch box which had “PROPERTY OF MR JOHNSON” emblazoned on it.I grabbed a huge bite of the sandwich and swallowed it whole.Victory tasted like…peanuts?Shit.Shit.Shit! I felt my throat closing up.I fumbled for my wallet.Opened it.Cant breathe. Hit the epipen its not there.Why the fuck isn’t it there.Then it hit me. Johnson had my wallet. Johnson knew I was fucking him over. Killing me would mean the manager position opens up and he’ll get the job irrespective of how shitty a job he does over here. Shit.\nI crumbled to the floor and then saw black.\n*****************************************************************************\n“Thank you Mr Chad.Your story confirms what we already knew” the balding detective assured me.\n“The Epipen was found in his bag hours after you were taken into the hospital” he ruffled through his rather shabby notes\n“And Glenda from your HR Department confirmed that Johnson had fleeting access to your HR Records”\n“So the bastards going to jail, isn’t he?”\n“For a long time Mr. Chad”\nThe detective and his partner left.It was just me,my laptop and the ECG now.\nI ignored the call from Glenda. I owe her and she will be rewarded….in time. I opened my laptop and got back to work.This is why I love this firm;its work life balance.\nOh, you want to know what happened? Wouldn’t you like to know? Going back to the two type of people that exist. The only thing I can tell you is I’m of the second variety.",

    "text": "FDM Group IT Training Scam, Fraud & Deception There are many agencies and firms that claim to provide you with 'jobs' and 'training', but there is one particular company who seem to con some people and a few of my friends. Unfortunately, I was also conned by this disgraceful firm. This firm is called 'FDM Group'. The FDM Group and their 'Academy' scheme are simply a con. There are a few things you should be aware of. They mostly do NOT guarantee you a job in IT after training with them. Most people I know were forced to take up positions that were not related to their IT training. For example, one of my friends who wanted to be a Java programmer, was never actually given a job in programming. He was doing their training and then pushed into a 'call-centre' job doing some IT support - nothing to do with Java or programming. They struggle to put people into their so called 'guaranteed' jobs so they pressure you into doing something a 'bit' different - so they make their money out of you with a 'huge' cut in commission out of your wages. In fact, FDM Group employs sales people who have NO knowledge of the IT industry - it is no wonder that they supply jobs that are not even IT-related.\n\nI was simply conned from the start with FDM Group and their dodgy contract. They make you sign a contract before your training which contains some dodgy clauses in it. They employed an old faggot called Scott Black who is used to lure people into this deception and false contract. Scott Black is another guy who has been used to contribute to the scams of this firm. The FDM Group like to scare-monger people into doing the jobs that they want you to do - not what you actually want to do or have trained to do. After starting with the FDM Group, I heard rumours from a few other colleagues about the scare-mongering tactics that are used. Mr Scott Black and other staff members have been employed to do this scare-mongering activity. They tried to threaten me once and forced me to take a job with a Bank that was not IT-related and nothing to do with my vast range of IT skills. They might seem nice at first, BUT after you sign their contract you are simply stuck in a rut with their scam. Please note that you are NOT guaranteed 2 years of work after training. Their contract contains a dodgy clause in it - they can 'terminate' your contract at any time and for any reason at all. If you don't comply with their wishes of doing any bullshit job then they can use their dodgy contract to get of rid you at any time. While I did their training, I received hardly any support from their trainers who were pathetic in their attitude towards me. Most of the training itself is copied off the internet - you could probably find much of it already on the net. This is what other trainees told me after I started with FDM. After using and abusing me, they discarded me like a piece of shit. They used me as just another scape-goat for their fraudulent activities. FDM Group were going through some turbulent times and struggling – so to cut their costs……they cut a lot of jobs, and owe 1000s in wages.\n\nI later discovered that this firm was investigated for fraud and deception. In particular, their operations manager, Steve Buxton was investigated and convicted of several counts of fraud by conning many graduates and promising them with careers and training in IT. As well as a racist, who abused many workers, he obtained 1000s of pounds from vulnerable graduates who were desperately seeking their careers in IT. In 2003 Steve Buxton was convicted but narrowly escaped a prison sentence. He already served a prison sentence in the 80s for Fraud, but his close connections to important people at the FDM Group helped him to secure a new future and conceal his criminal past. The FDM Group managed to pull some strings in order to cover up the traces of most of their fraudulent activities. Their CEO, Rod Flavell and his assistant, Julian Divett, were also investigated for their part in the scam. Due to their cold hearted manipulation of people, they concealed their traces of illegal activity that they still continue to this day. They have changed their management staff and shuffled their executive team to hide the scamming and fraudulent activities.  Rod Flavell and his staff are despicable fraudsters and con artists who deceive and target vulnerable young people who simply want a future in the IT profession. It is astonishing that this firm is still in business and still trying to con many innocent graduates. What a shame to the IT industry.....The FDM Group mainly give pathetic or non-existent training, lack of support, bullshit jobs with fake promises and a dodgy contract. It's no wonder they were investigated for fraud and deception.",

    "text": "Just typed this out on another thread thought I would share, my experience being hounded out of an all female office So l worked in an all female workplace. I was marketing and communications manager for a nonprofit with a staff of 11. I did social media, desktop publishing, graphic design, web, light IT, anything to do with marketing. The new black female ceo came in and harassed me about everything she could take issue with like being \"intimidating\" because I'm tall. \n\n\nAfter three years of exemplary performance under the previous ceo they eventually fired me for leaving work 15 minutes early and called it \"job abandonment\" and denied me unemployment and hired a female to replace me. She lasted a few months since she couldn't do the job and they hired another woman I went to school with who was totally incompetent. \n\n\nI tried to get out before the fired me since I knew they were trying to pressure me out. I interviewed for a similar position at the nearby university but they hired one of my boss's middle age Hispanic female colleagues over me and the black female who interviewed me told my boss I interviewed for the spot. The Hispanic female they hired instead of hiring me called me a week later to ask me \"how to do what I do.\" Of course there was no reason for me to teach her how to do a job she should have known how to do to get hired in the first place nor could I teach her in a phone conversation what took me years of work and study to learn. They fired me about a week later. \n\n\nIncidentally I set up my email to forward to the new ceo before I was removed from the system after asking on my way out if they wanted me to do that as we had with other employees who had quit and they said yes then the new ceo called the police because I was \"harassing her\" with thousands of emails...from a company account I was not in control of that was set up to forward under her instructions. Because of my job I handled dozens of accounts for various platforms and software and got probably 100 emails a day, like analytics reports and such. My favorite part was near the end when her Outlook needed to be fixed she left the calender open on the desktop and it said \"make [myname] f up\" for a day that week.  \n\nThen she trashed my name all over town so nobody would hire me. I tried to be a stay at home dad and my wife and I broke up. Haven't seen my kid in 3 years. Thanks for making the workplace more diverse. I used to be a liberal.",

    "text": "I need some advanced level networking advice finding job leads, cause I'm feeling tapped out Apologies for the wall of text but past posts on this have taught me that giving proper context better informs the advice. If you don't want to read all that, at least read the four questions at the bottom and give an answer for those. \n\n**About Me**\n\nI run an in-school program that provides academic support, HS athletics outreach & support, and post-secondary/college support. I want to focus more on academic support or post-secondary planning, but I'm interested in any education or youth development social justice work for now. \n\n**What I've done so far in my job search**\n\nI got some great advice on my resume between here at r/jobs and r/resumes, because my request to be interviewed went from 0-4 in my original resume 3-0 (Not counting two I reapplied to with the new resume). I have a whole system for crafting specific cover letters (e.g. I drop job postings in word clouds for words that occur most often). I could probably ramble less in interviews but even by my third interview I've already gotten better, so I feel pretty solid there. I hope this doesn't sound arrogant, I just want to be specific on where I would like some help on. \n\nI very quickly ran into issues of simply *finding* job openings. I routinely check the following job boards\n\n * Idealist\n * Indeed\n * LinkedIn\n * ZipRecruiter\n * LA2050\n * Jobscooper (though in fairness this is a recent addition)\n * Edjoin\n * Philanthropy News Digest's Job board\n * National Council of Nonprofits' Job Board\n * Nonprofit Career Match\n * Commongood Careers \n * Southern California Grantmakers\n\nI also checked out these, but they seem to be for executive level job seekers.\n\n * Bridgespan (Seems to be for executive level only)\n * Philanthropy Journal's Job Board\n\nI took that a step further and looked up directories about specific fields, and developed a Job Search Tracker with the company names hyperlinked to their career page sites so I could quickly go through their home sites in the hopes that they would post to their own site because they didn't want to spend the money or time dealing with job boards. I found places like \n\n * SoCal CAN (Southern California College Access Network)\n * Do Good LA\n\nI went through it and found 17 jobs posted out of 61 companies I had looked at them individually on their company webpages' job postings through this job search tracker. I also individually looked up all of these companies on LinkedIn for 1st and 2nd degree connections. There are a handful, and I'm considering reaching out to them soon. \n\n * Four were openings I had already applied to\n * Two were with charter schools which I would really like to avoid (I have nothing against charter schools, but that would greatly limit my career options: it's seen as a black mark to be previously from a charter school in much of the education community. It's far wiser to appear neutral on this issue unless/until one decides what specific area of education they want a career in.)\n * Two were national and not hiring in California, let alone LA. Another was in Sacramento and friends from Cali suggested I would hate it there based on what I want in my personal life. \n * I am clearly under-qualified for two openings.\n * Three were out of my function: One in development, communications/research, and organizing protests. \n * One was only part-time, and another was seasonal; I want only full-time work. * I found one that I was qualified and for full-time, but the company had *horrendous* glassdoor reviews. These are overblown in my experience, but the language used was akin to a previous employer I had a negative experience with, so I'm ruling them out. \n\nThe problem with this method though is there are around ~30,000 nonprofits in LA county. I can't reasonably find good companies efficiently by looking through directories. So I can't reasonably scale up this route and I would be likely missing out on great opportunities. \n\nSince I started looking in Late April, I've found only 9 jobs that meet my salary requirements (Idealist lists min/max salaries occasionally, I've ruled out a few based on this), in LA county, that I'm qualified for. Almost all of them I found on Idealist. That's about a job opening applied to a week. After I fixed up my resume, about five applications in, I got three interviews out of the next four applications. \n\n**Where I feel stuck**\n\nWhat's frustrating is I am sure the jobs are there: For every job opening I find, there appears to be 10 Manager, Director or Executive job openings posted. I have a daily job email alert for the entirety of LA county and often as few as two postings are new each day. I suspect many would prefer to have people come in as interns, AmeriCorps fellows, or volunteers. There are a lot of credentialed/teaching jobs, too, but they require Masters or credentials that I don't have and most don't substitute experience. \n\n**Personal reasons why I want to leave my job at the end of the school year**\n\nNow, I know what some of you are thinking: \"Well why don't you get certified or go back to grad school?\" \n\nI'm planning on it. I've already taken the GRE, scoring in the 75th percentile in the verbal and 54th in the quant, and apparently that's good enough to get into most education/policy related programs. I also got three recommendation letters ready. It's really just a matter of waiting until the portals open in the fall to start applying. It means I need to work for another year. \n\nBut I want to leave my job *now*. I essentially I took over a site at a school at the beginning of the year going through a major period of transition, and both my organization and my school completely didn't consider how this transition would affect the programming that had served both the school and my organization so well. It was supposed to be a reward from my supervisor who wanted me to have a good experience following a negative experience with my school in the first year (They had a new administration my first year that had zero interest in our mission goals). Essentially the school thought they could have their cake and eat it too, and they were not shy about expressing their confusion as to why we couldn't just \"adjust\" the programming. Some teachers actively undermined the SAT class I ran by pulling my students for extending time on their own projects. I got a lot of pushback for merely suggesting people should stop doing this. My classroom got turned into a dumping ground for students with empty blocks in their schedules during the day. This sucked because just as I developed a relationship that allowed for mentoring and holding the student accountable, they pulled them and put them in another class. It got to a point where I just gave up on my organizational goals to more actively pursue what the school wanted, with my supervisor's blessing, in order to repair the relationship, but the communication was so shitty most of the time I could only describe it as the left hand not knowing what the right hand was doing, and there I am with my own hand extended, sweating nervously with a smile on my face to hide the frustration of it all. \n\nI knew I had to leave after Teacher Appreciation week: Every single teacher, support staff and even other partners like myself that don't work directly for the school were recognized on the wall with student appreciation profiles. All of them, except myself. Friends have told me that I was mostly likely not on someone's list for that. I would say there are only a couple of teachers that actively dislike me for \"office politics\" reasons, so they are probably right. Still stings though. As pissed as I am I'm still treating the job professionally. Honest. Recently built a google sheet that calculates a students GPA by simply copying and pasting a students transcript into a cell on one sheet, and on another, that student's transcript is translated into GPA, highlighting weakest subjects, and giving the teacher's name. The coach who asked for help on this loved it. Now they can actually hound their players about their grades when there's a difference to be made as opposed to reacting to it when there's nothing to be done. \n\nThis all sucks because I'm pretty good with kids, and as pissed as I am at the school, they are not bad people. They just stopped caring about our goals. I just want a new experience and something exciting. I've always wanted to move to the West coast. \n\nI know I am already testing the patience of the reader with the personal anecdotes, but I assure you this is relevant. I was diagnosed with GAD and depression two years ago, and I was informed that I was likely experiencing symptoms since my teens. Loneliness and social opportunities are extremely important to me, as simply being around friends, particularly friends that know my situation has really made the difference in my mental health. LA is the only city where I have any personal network outside of my current city. Moreover, all of them are fully aware of my mental health.\n\n**The Questions**\n\nSo apart from general advice, I'd really appreciate some answers to the following questions. \n\n * What are some of the more exciting non-profits in LA that relate to social justice, particularly in education or college access? Even if they are not hiring, I'd like to get started writing more letters of interest. That's obviously much easier to do with companies the substance of which I'm interested in. \n\n * Based on my resume and situation, what other job functions or fields would you recommend I look into? I'm willing to broaden, but I feel pretty lost on rebranding myself in a way that would appeal to outside my job function and field. \n\n * Is there a LA specific version of [The top 50 best nonprofits to work at](http://thenonprofittimes.com/rd/4-1-17_BestNonprofits_LR.pdf)? It lists the companies based on quality-of-life metrics as well as impact metrics.\n\n * Is there any way I can find or develop a IF This Then That or Google Alert that I can set up for job openings to specific company websites, or job openings with certain key words? \n\n\nAny specific advice is greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks,\n\nu/weaksidewing",

    "text": "Finished grad school, got hired by a very prestigious organization in a position that I am frankly unqualified for and don't want to make a career out of. What do I do!? (X-post from r/career guidance in order to case a wider net) Buenos Nachos, good people of r/jobs.\n\nSo, last March I finished grad school. I fairly randomly applied to a data-science position with a world-renowned nonprofit which is a BIG name in my field. I never really expected to even interview for the position, let alone be offered the position. As I said, it's a data-science type position, which involves a fair amount of computer programming and statistics. Frankly, I'm utterly unqualified. I spent about 6 weeks learning enough about programming in a particular language to be able to sound like I knew what I was talking about during the interview, but outside of that, I had no CS experience. I also only took one math class ever in both my undergraduate and graduate programs.\n\nI honestly have no idea how I landed a job offer, but given that this organization is so well known and well respected and in my field, I of course said yes. I've been working in the position for the past six months, and I've been doing everything I can to try and learn what I need to know to fulfill the responsibilities of this position.\nI've spent the last 6 months learning what I can about computer programming and statistics, and doing my best to complete any projects and assignments I've been given. I've spent hundreds of dollars on CS and stats textbooks to try and learn what I don't know, to try and be able to do this job, but I don't think it's working. The CEO and my Department's director have both expressed that they are impressed with my work, thought to be honest, I suspect that they simply don't know enough about it to spot that I have no idea what I'm doing. I often, as in on a near daily basis, feel like someone is going to realize that I really have no clue what I'm doing, which is incredibly uncomfortable.\n\nThe most important aspect of all this, I feel, is that the longer I'm in this position the more I realize that despite the potentially highly lucrative career opportunities, should I be able to make a career out of this type of work, it's not work I want to do for the next 30 years.\n\nSo, I guess that brings me to my question. Given that this data-science field isn't a field I'm comfortable in, and a field that I don't want to be in forever, and I really only accepted the position because having work for this organization on my resume will open doors in my field, what do I do? On the one hand, the longer I work for this organization, the better it looks, and I certainly don't want to leave after only being here for six months. On the other hand, when it eventually comes to light that I really have no clue what I'm doing (which I suspect will happen as soon as we try to publish a scientific paper I was requested to write, because people that actually know what they're doing will look at my work and instantly recognize that I'm clueless), I'm afraid that it will leave an indelible black spot on my career.\n\nSo how do I resolve that conflict between knowing that this isn't the type of position I want to make a career out of, knowing that I truly have no idea what I'm doing, wanting to have a position with this organization long enough that it will open doors for me, but having that feeling of dread and ticking time bomb-ness that eventually someone is going to realize that I am utterly unqualified for my position? Do I cut bait and start applying for positions that I'm actually qualified for/want to make a career out of immediately? Do I sit in my corner cubicle with my head down, wait for the other shoe to drop, and deal with that fallout when it happens? Do I wait around for another 6 months or a year and try to get out before anyone realizes that I have no business being employed in this position?\n\nI'm familiar with \"impostor syndrome\", and freely acknowledge that feeds in to some degree to my feeling of being a fraud, which is exacerbated by the fact that I often find myself going days at a time without really any \"work\" to do. However, I also freely acknowledge that, objectively, I do not have the technical skills or education to perform this position exceptionally and it is only the fact that no one in the building is a computer scientist or statistician that has prevented that revelation among my superiors.\n\ntl;dr - I bullshitted my way into a highly technical position with a leading organization in my field, I don't want want to make that position into a career (and I'm not sure I'm capable of doing so if I did), and I'm not sure how, or how quickly, to extricate myself before someone with the ability to fire me realizes I'm horribly out of my depth. What do I do?\n\nThanks for the advice, and I apologize for the ridiculously long post.",

Everything checks out  par was changed at lunch and relatively clean, the mooncup could be drained... But I really don't want to go through that hassle... I'll do it after the meeting when there aren't other girls in the bathroom. I decided to roll up a bunch of toilet paper as backup and went on my merry way to my meeting. \nNearing the end of the meeting I started cramping. I decided I would go to the bathroom again as soon as the meeting was out. I need to talk less, I went over on my meeting and the next meeting a training presentation. It was about that time I really started gushing... I needed to go now... But I could not move. I was doing everything I could to try and hold in the feeling so I could stand up. I finally was able to excuse myself and I went to get a new overnight maxi. I started walking to the bathroom calmly at first. Then my hand brushed my butt, wetness, I started walking faster. Through the mantrap, across a hall in a sea of cubicles, in front of the break room finally to the bathroom. I was confident that my strategicly chosen black pants were shielding me. \n\nAgain warning it's gross.\n\nWhen I went to change I found soaked panties almost no dry cloth left, silent tears started falling. I need to get that damn surgery, no I needed to change my pad, see if my massive leak is visible, get my stuff and run like the wind home to change. I stopped crying and started cleaning. I was still excited that I was wearing black pants. When I left the stall  I walked past coworkers and tried to hurry and wash my face. I was fortunate no one talked to me. I turned around to see a redish brown, it was pretty much glowing... :'( I couldn't hold back the tears anymore. I just didn't know what to do at this point. I was fucked, there was no way I could leave this room. There was nothing I could do and it wasn't stopping. I called my coworker to bring my stuff to the bathroom. Luckily she brought another one of my friends to help. I just sobbed, I let them know what happened. It was then I realized I probably soiled the chair and that we needed to get it before someone sat in it. Then I realized that the presentation I left suddenly was being recorded... That is right... Fucking recorded. I put on my backpack lowered it to cover my butt walk with my coworker who followed behind me. I am grateful for having her to talk to and she walked me all the way to my car. I gave her a hug and thanked her for helping me. It was time for my work day to end.",

When I was informed they wanted to hire me they gave me a start date 2.5 weeks away. As soon as I received my offer letter I put in my two weeks via email as I am a night shifter and planned on talking to my manager about it when I saw her. Before I could get a chance to talk to her, she left me a nasty voicemail calling me unprofessional for not resigning in person and told me she would 'hold' my resignation till I called her. Yeah. I didn't call her back right away because I honestly didn't know what I would say and was kind of flabbergasted by the voicemail. I work the weekend shift and she comes in that next Monday morning and corners me right before shift change in front of my peers in the middle of the pod and berates me for not calling her back, calls me unprofessional to my face and then makes mention of a comment a friend of mine made on my facebook about the unit. This lady does not have me on facebook. The place I am working at has been driven into the ground by this manager, 70% of people aren't making it through orientation because they quit and since I started almost two years ago 70% of the original staff has quit.\n\nI kind of want to contact HR and her director and let them know what went down. I'm pretty sure there is already an HR investigation against her because they are trying to figure out why people are quitting. What would you all do?

    "text": "[PA] [11/12] - Having a terrible student teaching experience. Advice please **TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue. Now I'm facing two serious conversations with my school in less than a week span trying to find a resolution to move forward.**\n\nI am at a AA-sized school in western PA outside of the city. When I was first assigned to this school I was excited as the mentor teacher had received some awards and plaudits both statewide and even a national one. I thought \"what better person to learn from that this person\".\n\nWhen we first started it was going great. She was excellent at teaching me the ins and outs of contracts, etc (which I realize now was totally off-topic and shouldn't have even come up), the mechanics of school politics (again, some bells going off) and so forth.\n\nDuring the first week, I could see how she was a really good teacher. The kids respect her and she has great classroom management. On Tuesday of the first week, she said she would want me to start teaching the following week. So she would take the first Econ class of the day and I would teach the two in the afternoon. She wanted me to start drafting lesson plans for these days and then we'd go over them on Friday.\n\nThe first week of doing Econ in the afternoon went well, so she had me take over that class full time in Week 3, while I took over the second of her two Psych/Soc classes in the same format. In Week 4, it was all me for everything.\n\nWhile I was excited to jump into teaching full time, I should have had a few alarm bells going off:\n\n* why wasn't she modeling her preferred style of lesson planning to me?\n* why was she moving faster than my university's suggested timetable for giving me more responsibility?\n* how was I going to be expected to extrapolate from her incredibly abridged lesson plans?\n\nI took comfort in the fact that, at the beginning, she would sit down with me and go over what she would expect to me to cover the next week and so forth M-F. And it became our ritual, in a sense, for us to sort of broadly go over the next week on Friday and then for me to turn in an overview of the week by Sunday, which she would comment on if there were any concerns.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. She is busy on Friday with students asking about extracurricular stuff and my attempts to connect on the following week's material are rebuffed. So I do my best on Friday evening and Saturday to map out the week, extrapolating from a very thinly detailed syllabus to try to use as a pacing guide. I text her on Saturday evening asking if we could go over the plans for the week, and she responds \"I'm busy right now, I'll call you tomorrow at 5\". (bear in mind, she told me from day one that if I EVER need help to call and she'll \"talk me down from the ledge\" and work with me\".\n\nThe next day, I reach out by email ahead of time, sort of detailing all of my concerns about the upcoming week, my confusion over the pacing and wording in the syllabus and uncertainty as to her suggestions from the past. \n\nThen 5 comes and I get no response, then 7, then 9 - and by this point I'm freaking-the-fuck out. So I send another follow up text stating that I had sent an email with some questions and I was hoping to discuss the following day, at least, as well as the week moving forward.\n\nI get a text at 11:30 pm asking \"have you figured it out yet\". To which I of course responded no and that I thought i at least had a plan for the next day but that I really needed some clarification on the rest of the week. She responded \"**i can keep holding your hand forever, but you'll never learn anything that way. I need those lesson plans before 7 tomorrow. See you then**\n\nSo when she came in the door in the morning, I was hastily wrapping up the weekly overview lesson plan to be turned into the office - basically just going off of whatever she did last year.\n\nThen all week long, there was this tension in the classroom. I could feel it growing. I was frustrated with her for essentially abandoning me with little preparation (a strategy which many of my teacher friends derided as unprofessional and extremely unhelpful). She seemed annoyed with me for seemingly needing any help at this point.\n\nOn Wednesday, I get an email from the director of field placements at my university wanting to have a phone meeting the next day. On that phone meeting is literally everyone in the chain from the top of the school of education down to me. \n\nMy site director first allows me space to give my side, and then proceeds to list a rapsheet of complaints and errors on my part that have been privately communicated to her over the past week or two about my untimeliness in turning stuff in and unpreparedness for the day each day and needing to have my hand held for every little thing...yadda yadda.\n\nI was so taken aback and felt so cornered, but i swallowed my tears and the lump in my throat and did my best to give a fair account of everything from my end, to include - which I've yet to mention - that the previous week she broke her tooth in half and had 2 miss days of school in pain after getting it pulled and i was left with subs, etc. Then the following days she was in pain because she couldn't take her percocet before coming to school and so was always in a foul mood, but I did my best to steer clear, etc.\n\nThe school seemed understanding of my side, and said they aimed to support me in whatever way possible to help get me across the finish line.\n\nThen yesterday was teacher in-service. Teachers are supposed to be given an itinerary at least a week ahead of time. Our teachers were given them on Wednesday. My MT forwarded the email to me, but i notified her that as it was a Google doc, and she was not the creator, it wasn't able to be opened unless shared by the creator. She said she'd follow up, but never did.\n\nSo I arrive at 8 the on Friday morning, and go to meet her in the classroom, which is where we met previously. She's not there; door locked. I go to the auditorium, which is where in-service began last time, and no one is there. Finally I hear an announcement and see teachers walking toward the collaboration center, so I join them and we all walk in the door at 8. I get a text from her at 8:02 saying \"in-service started 2 minutes ago and you aren't here\". So i responded \"im here, in the back of the room\". She turns around and makes eye contact.\n\nLater in the day I get a call from my site director asking how the day is going, if I'm feeling any better after the ambush on the phone the day before, etc. Then she asks, what time did the in-service start this morning? I said, \"8\". \"And when did you arrive?\" \"just before 8\". \"Well, your mentor teacher sent me an email notifying me that you didn't arrive until 9\".\n\nI was PISSED. I forwarder her the texts proving that I was there at 8 and that I had notified my mentor teacher of my presence in the back of the room.\n\nI got ANOTHER call from the university and after some back and forth, they sort of seemed to agree with my suggestion that I felt that I was being sabotaged at this point for whatever reason. They said to not go into school on Monday, don't contact my mentor teacher, don't contact the school - they'll take care of it. What they want is to have a meeting where all the expectations of all parties are laid out in black and white, on paper, so there's no confusion, and then we'll figure out a path forward from there.\n\nI'm so frustrated and confused and exhausted and exasperated over the whole thing. I don't even know what to do going forward. I was told to not make any more lesson plans at this point and to just take the weekend to spend time with my kids and wife and think about some solutions to help get me across the finish line on December 8.\n\nI'm so furious I don't even know what to do. I'm also worried that my MT, if I remain in her classroom, is going to sabotage me by switching subjects this week to throw off any lesson planning I've already done (both classes are combined Psych/Soc and Gov/Econ) and we go back and forth. Everything I've planned for the rest of my time there is in Sociology and Gov, so I half expect to walk in the door tuesday and she'll have been teaching Psych and Econ and tell me to hurry up and make some lesson plans for the rest of the week.\n\nAnyway. Suggestions?\n\n**TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue.

    "text": "2 years in dead-end solo graduate role, has this damaged my work prospects? Hi, \n\nI've worked as a solo developer in a planning, environment and cultural sector startup for 2 years. I took the job originally since it promised a lot of freedom (too much) with the expectation that we would be expanding my side of things bringing in some peers to work alongside me. I believe now that this will never happen or at least, not in a reasonable period of time in the near future so I am looking for new work.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs far as my role goes, it has never been well defined; from day 1 I was dropped in, wound up and set to go choosing whatever toolsets, frameworks, programming languages etc that I felt were appropriate for what my boss (our director) wanted. While this was enjoyable at first, becoming aware that there is no clear future direction coupled with frequent of switching of projects that are never seen to completion , it has worn thin on me. The original allusion to personal autonomy was really code for being completely unmanaged which has been an unfortunate theme in the business at large. While I am an independent person and appreciate the virtues of such a liberty, it has become more and more apparent to me that a position like this isn't best suited to a fresh graduate with no industry experience to draw from and I would thrive much better in a more traditional environment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy background is in straight Computer Science where I graduated in 2014 with a strong 2:1 from a top university. However, the focus of my studies was more on the architectural and theoretical side of things rather than explicit software development although I was trained in OOP in Java and used C a fair amount during my algorithmic studies.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOn the job I have taught myself web development in Ruby + RoR along with a basic competency in common web technologies (HTML5, CSS, JS/JQuery). I chose to learn these technologies since they were good for rapid development and I enjoy jumping into new areas. However I must say that I don't feel confident in these capacities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe job has left me amotivated (in this company) and with a degree of anxiety over my abilities. Having spent 2 years switching between projects coding in a bubble, I feel deprived from sharing intellectual space with other developers whom I can work with and learn from in addition to functioning more as a hacker rather than a developer in a well defined software development process; a true industrial context. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn short I fear that having this experience under my belt has done me more harm than good as far as career hunting goes although I have learned a lot on a personal level. I'm not sure how to market myself with what I feel is a black spot on my CV so I'm hoping someone can give me some perspective here. What I truly want is a fresh chance in a company with a good culture where I can be a learning sponge in so I can grow myself as serious developer from the ground up but I am worried that these opportunities are reserved for the fresh graduates. I am not averse to learning any new languages or technologies although I do have a preference against .Net tech since from the beginning of my studies through to today I have always operated in a UNIX environment which I'm competent in using effectively.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI tried to keep that as brief as possible as I could go into much more detail. To that effect I'll expand on anything if anyone has any questions. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThanks for you time",

I know a lot of ladies feel like diversity in Hollywood shouldn't be celebrating like it's a victory but should be expecting at this point. I get that I'm still happy as fuck that the new Spider-Man movie has so much melanin. The movie actually looks like the town I grew up in!😄 Thanks casting/director for not pretending Queens is still white as hell. \n\nIt's also refreshing to see that Laura Harrier's character (Liz Allen) had a mixed race family. I love our light skinned, mixed race sisters but it's so annoying (and offensive) that they are often given dark skinned parents. It reeks of colorism and it doesn't represent black families or mixed families at all! Unrealistic casting only appeals to white minds who are only comfortable with a light face.\n\nNow… if only we could get a Miles Morales movie... In the meantime, I'm looking forward to Black Panther!",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "Enrollments, budgets fall short at universities known for ‘social justice warfare’  more people are getting the message. not attending these indoctrination centres is more effective. less students less revenue.\n............................................\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/14/enrollment-drops-at-schools-known-for-social-justi/\n\nUniversities known for being hotbeds of campus protest and liberal activism are struggling with declining enrollments and budget shortfalls, and higher education analysts say that’s no coincidence.\nTake Oberlin College. According to a document leaked to The Oberlin Review, the school’s student newspaper, the small liberal arts college famous for social justice hoaxes has had trouble attracting and retaining students, missing this year’s enrollment mark by 80 and racking up a $5 million budget deficit in the process.\nWilliam A. Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School who runs the Legal Insurrection blog, said the “most obvious culprit” in Oberlin’s dwindling admissions is “relentless social justice warfare.”\n\n“Social justice warfare at Oberlin has been more intense and sustained over a longer period of time than at most schools, and has come to define Oberlin in the media,” Mr. Jacobson said. “The resulting mockery and derision, even in liberal publications, has damaged the Oberlin brand.”\nSurveys support the notion that, in the era of Trump, conservatives have become more skeptical about the value of a college degree.\nThe polarizing presidential election was felt in the dip in applicants at some top-tier colleges such as Ohio’s Kenyon College.\n\n“This is a year in which you were vulnerable if you were a small liberal arts college in a rural red state and you attract a significant portion of your student body from the East Coast or West Coast, which would certainly be the case with Kenyon,” Diane Anci, Kenyon’s vice president of enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, told the Ohio school’s Kenyon Collegian newspaper.\nA study published by the Washington-based Pew Research Center in July found that just 36 percent of Republicans believe colleges and universities have a positive effect on the country, down from 54 percent two years ago.\nGallup released a poll in August that found just 33 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents had a “great deal or quite a lot of confidence in higher education.” Sixty-seven percent said they have “some or very little” confidence in academia.\nHigh school counselors report that, in the past few years, parents have been more likely to express concern about sending their children to schools with progressive reputations.\n“Many won’t consider Oberlin or Wesleyan, and Brown is completely off the table,” one counselor told Inside Higher Education in June.\n\nThe problem may be especially pronounced among the nation’s heartland. Inside Higher Education reports that several prestigious, small liberal arts colleges in the Midwest have missed their enrollment marks this year.\nSome college administrators have taken notice. According to Inside Higher Education’s annual survey, 52 percent of admissions directors from public colleges and 28 percent from private ones said they were stepping up their recruitment of students from rural areas in the wake of the presidential race.\nDeclining enrollments have previously been observed at colleges and universities that became notorious for chaotic campus activism, including the University of Missouri and Evergreen State College.\nBy some estimates, enrollment at the former is down 35 percent since fall 2015, when student protests helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement.\nMeanwhile, Evergreen faces a $2.1 million budget shortfall this year since students took over the campus last spring, barricading themselves in the library, berating administrators on a regular basis and forcing one dissenting professor to teach off campus out of fear for his safety.\nA spokesperson for Oberlin College did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\nThe school’s problems cannot be traced to a single incident but to several.\nIn February 2013, mass hysteria ensued after racist and anti-Semitic flyers and graffiti began to appear all over campus. Classes were canceled, meetings were held and students began to see racism around every corner, including when someone reported seeing a member of the Ku Klux Klan on campus. It turned out to be a woman walking around wrapped in a blanket to keep warm.\nNot only that, the perpetrators behind the racist paraphernalia turned out to be two progressive students, one of whom was confirmed to be an Obama supporter, trying to get a reaction out of their classmates and the administration.\nRather than admit the whole thing was a hoax and move on, the Oberlin administration doubled down on a social justice agenda, including the implementation of a privilege and oppression “reorientation” for first-year students.\nIn the ensuing years, Oberlin students would go on to make frequent demands of the university, ranging from the end of culturally appropriated meals at the dining hall, such as General Tso’s chicken and sushi, to the elimination of grades below a C.\nIn 2015, after the University of Missouri protests, the Oberlin Black Student Union issued a 14-page letter making 50 demands of the administration. They included exclusive “safe spaces” for black students and the elimination of graduation requirements for classes in Western civilization.\nLast November, Oberlin students targeted Gibson’s Bakery, a beloved store in Oberlin, Ohio, after an employee called police when he saw someone attempting to shoplift by concealing two bottles of wine under his jacket. The accused shoplifter turned out to be a black Oberlin student.\nThe Black Student Union, Oberlin Student Senate and College Democrats spearheaded a boycott of the bakery and organized protests outside of the store. Even the Oberlin administration, responding to calls from Black Lives Matter supporters on campus, stopped purchasing goods from the bakery.\nThree students involved in the incident ended up pleading guilty to attempted theft and aggravated trespassing. As part of a plea deal, the students acknowledged that the bakery’s actions were “not racially motivated” and that the store was “merely trying to prevent an underage sale.”\nMost of the enrollment deficit at Oberlin came from a smaller-than-expected freshman class, which totaled 742 instead of a projected 805.\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that drop-off is more serious than it may appear.\n“That doesn’t sound like an astonishing number of people not coming, but weighed on a percentage basis, that’s a huge drop in just one year,” Mr. Wood said. “And Oberlin has for some time been struggling to make its classes. This wasn’t just some negligence: ‘Oh, we didn’t realize that we had to try harder to get students.’ They’ve been trying really hard to get students, and students just aren’t coming.”\nHe said Oberlin can easily recoup the $5 million deficit by cutting the “apparatus of political correctness” that has swelled in the past several years. When that happens, he said, it will be a sign that the school is serious about reform.\n“The signal that I would look for is when they begin to divest from the large number of personnel who are employed wholly because of their political orientations,” he said. “When that happens, I think we will have seen a college that has decided to reposition itself in the market. Until then, it’s all just show.”",

That's why I knew participating in the RUN4HOPE was a perfect fit. Though, [some people](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/cafe-bmo-marathon-men-s-charity-sexual-violence-assault-1.4057052) wouldn't agree with me.\n\nThis Sunday, May 7th at 7am, Jeridan Kowal [(my running bro, pictured left)](http://i.imgur.com/0210Y0f.jpg) and myself will be running a half-marathon on behalf of CAFE and proudly flying it's colours to raise awareness of men's issues, and particularly men's mental health (more on that in a moment). I have a favour to ask, but first a couple points:\n\nFirstly I want to thank Jeridan for supporting me and dedicating himself to our running program that has resulted in me shedding over 25+ pounds! Having him in my corner made all the difference when rain, taut muscles, or just a plain bad mood tempted me to cancel a training session.\n\nSecondly I want to dedicate my run to my brother Russell, who was diagnosed with severe depression in his early teens. He was not alone in our family in being kept company by this \"black dog\" (my sister, mother, and myself also have wrestled with it) but, by far, he was the most impacted. Russell is intelligent and kind, but has chosen to withdraw from the world for over 20 years as a means of coping. I run in hopes that he, and others like him, will find his voice and re-emerge into the world on his terms, with no apologies.\n\nI believe better resources are needed to address men's mental health issues - and that's why all donations to our RUN4HOPE fundraiser will go directly to funding a Vancouver Centre For Men & Families to be opened in 2018.\n\nPlease support team CAFE in the RUN4HOPE marathon and let's make a difference together.\n\n[Donation link](https://www.crowdrise.com/canadian-association-for-equality/fundraiser/philipjohnston3)",

    "text": "From The Archives (2003) - \"The Greater Outrage for Female Victims of Governments' Brutality Perpetuates Risk to Both Sexes\" **The Greater Outrage for Female Victims of Governments' Brutality Perpetuates Risk to Both Sexes**\n\n©2003 Jerry A. Boggs\n\nNothing, it seems, provokes the international community’s outrage more than the atrocities and lesser abuses that governments direct at women and girls.\n\nAmnesty International sounds [this alarm](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112150604/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT770021996?open&of=ENG-373): “...[G]overnments have continued to inflict sexual, physical, and other psychological violence against women with impunity ... In recent years, the horrific stories of rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the mass rape by the military and the militia in Rwanda have shown how particularly vulnerable women are in conflicts – how they are often singled out for human rights violations which are not inflicted on men and how assault on a woman’s body is used as a weapon of war.”\n\nIn a speech to the First Ladies' Conference on Domestic Violence in San Salvador in 1998, feminist politician [Hillary Clinton said](https://web.archive.org/web/20061028234519/http://clinton3.nara.gov:80/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1998/19981117.html), “Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children.”\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, at the March 1999 Inter-Agency Videoconference for a World Free of Violence against Women, [lamented](https://web.archive.org/web/20080325035702/http://www.scienceblog.com:80/community/older/archives/L/1999/A/un990269.html), “Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And, it is perhaps the most pervasive.\"\n\nAnd so it goes, up and down the international community, from human rights groups and heads of state, to organized feminists and the mainstream media – all regularly and rightly deploring governments’ savaging of females.\n\nYet when it comes to the inhumane treatment of noncombatant men and boys, nearly everyone seems to have incurred a severe case of laryngitis. By expressing little or no outrage for male victims of government barbarity — or altogether denying there are male victims, as Amnesty often seems to do — the international community does worse than merely expose an antimale bias that gainsays its own long-running plea for equal treatment of the sexes. It also helps perpetuate state-directed brutality against both men and women.\n\nPerhaps before one can even be willing to hear how a greater outrage over anti-female violence could possibly perpetuate this violence, one must be disaffected of the feminist-and-media-driven notion that females are overwhelmingly the marks for governments’ enormities. One must be convinced that men, including non-combatant men, are marked at least as much and that an equal outrage for male victims is therefore justified.\n\nEnter Adam Jones. He is executive director of the Canadian-based human rights group, [Gendercide Watch](http://www.gendercide.org/), and professor of international studies at the Center for Research and Training in Economics in Mexico City. Defining “gendercide” as gender-selective mass killings, Jones has amassed considerable documentation and published scholarly works showing that non-combatant males are subjected to atrocities and mistreatments comparable to, and in many cases worse than, those dealt females.\n\nNon-combatant men, says Jones, “have been and continue to be the most frequent targets of mass killing and genocidal slaughter, as well as a host of lesser atrocities and abuses. The mass killing of males, particularly of ‘battle-age’ men, has roots deep in the history of conflict between human communities. Despite this prevalence of gendercide against males...the subject has received almost no attention across a wide range of policy areas, humanitarian initiatives, and academic disciplines. We at Gendercide Watch feel it is one of the great taboos of the contemporary age, and must be ignored no longer.”\n\n(Jones puts “battle-age” in quotation marks “to problematize a term that rolls off the tongue too easily. The ‘battle-age’ construction implicitly assumes that if a male is of an age that renders him liable to military conscription and combat, his entire identity should be so defined. This renders the analyst complicit with those who would subordinate the destiny of ‘battle age’ males to this outside demand – akin to defining women by their capacity to be raped, and suggesting as well that ‘battle-age’ men are ‘asking for it.’ With this equation of males and combatants completed, the analyst or policymaker can move to the final stage of effacing all non-combatant males from the policy and analytical equation, a phenomenon that is also commonplace.”)\n\nJones’ Gendercide.org is rich in examples of widely ignored gendercides against males. Some from the 20th century are:\n\n* Kosovo, 1999: “Although the Milosevic regime's genocidal assault on Kosovar society swept up all other sectors of the population, killing many and expelling hundreds of thousands, the most systematic and severe atrocities were inflicted disproportionately upon non-combatant men.”\n\n* Srebrenica (Bosnia), 1995: “The long-term success of ethnic cleansing depended on killing off the Muslim men, without whom the population's women and children would have no means of returning.”\n\n* Rwanda, 1994: “[After the massacre] Rwanda became a country of women. It is currently estimated that 70 per cent of the population is female and that 50 per cent of all households are headed by women.” \n\n* Iraq, 1988, 1990-91: During the 1990-91 Gulf War, though officials and the media decried Iraqi troops’ abuse of Kuwaiti and foreign women, little was said of the broader Iraqi system of detention, torture, and execution of tens of thousands of Kuwaitis who were nearly all male. The Iraqi regime’s postwar attack on the Shia “marsh Arabs” in southern Iraq appears to have been highly gender-specific. A Middle East Watch researcher explained, “The troops are arresting all males over 15 and taking them to Radwaniyeh [prison camp]. They’re never seen again.” Thousands are estimated to have died, often after horrific torture. In 1988, during the suppression of rebellious Iraqi Kurds, Middle East Watch reported instances in which men and boys among the captured villagers were executed on the spot. Many tens of thousands of Kurdish males disappeared. The organization suspects that most of them, if not all, were murdered by Iraqi security forces.\n\n* Delhi, 1984: In “Delhi: Gangster Rule,” Madhu Kishwar reports on the 1984 anti-Sikh rioting in New Delhi following the assassination of Indira Gandhi: “The nature of the attacks confirm [sic] that there was a deliberate plan to kill as many Sikh men as possible, hence nothing was left to chance. That also explains why in almost all cases, after hitting or stabbing, the victims were doused with kerosene or petrol and burnt, so as to leave no possibility of their surviving. Between October 31 and November 4, more than 2,500 men were murdered in different parts of Delhi, according to several careful unofficial estimates. There have been very few cases of women being killed except when they got trapped in houses which were set on fire. Almost all the women interviewed described how men and young boys were special targets. When women tried to protect the men of their families, they were given a few blows and were forcibly separated from the men. Even when they clung to the men, trying to save them, they were hardly ever attacked the way men were. I have not yet heard of a case of a woman being assaulted and then burnt to death by the mob.”\n\n* Bangladesh, 1971 (then East Pakistan): In February of that year, the generals of West Pakistan decided to crush the Awami League, which had demanded regional autonomy for East Pakistan and an end to military rule. “Kill three million of them,” said President Yahya Khan at the February conference, “and the rest will eat out of our hands.” At the end of this brutal campaign, 80 percent of the estimated 3 million lives taken in the systematic mass killings were males, many of them adolescent boys.\n\n* World War II, 1941-42: During Operation Barbarossa in just eight months of 1941-42. Invading German armies killed approximately 2.8 million Soviet PoWs through starvation, exposure, and summary execution. “This little-known gendercide,” says Adam Jones, “vies with the genocide in Rwanda as the most concentrated mass killing in human history.” Adam Jones classifies this as a gendercide because “PoW did not just mean men who had seen military service. Nazi policy was explicitly that all men between 15 and 65 were to be taken to PoW camps.”\n\n* Armenia, 1915: According to Jones as interviewed in March 2000 by the Ottawa Citizen’s Christina Spencer, “The first step of that brutal terror was the disarming of conscript Armenian soldiers in the Turkish army. They were turned into pack animals, ‘driven by the whips and bayonets of the Turks into the mountains.’ The weak were left to die or were shot. Next, civilian males were taken from their towns and slaughtered. At this point, the rest of the population -- women, children, the elderly -- were deported.”\n\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Forty million Soviet men were killed between 1914 and 1945. Some families lost every man in the family: dad, son, brother, uncle. Yet a headline in Parade, the largest-selling weekly magazine in the world, reads “Short End of the Stick” with the article explaining Soviet women are getting the short end of the stick because they are stuck with factory and street-cleaner positions. In Bosnia, the civil war has wiped out men so disproportionately that only 30% of the Bosnian population are men. Do headlines tell us, “War leaves Bosnia with 30% Men”? No. Parade’s headline reads, “Women Look to Gain Power in Bosnia.” The focus on the sacrifice made by men as a gender was not only ignored, but Bosnia has specifically been used as an example of the type of war in which both sexes are killed equally. When there’s a story about a man being killed, the focus is not on the sacrifice of men, but of their role. We discover the sacrifice of men as a gender only when it is needed to help us understand the new burdens on women. — ***The Myth of Male Power***, by [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20071107132658/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_5.htm)|\n\n**Adam Jones** also tackles military conscription as a gender-selective abuse. Though sexual slavery of females is easily seen as such an abuse, conscription is not. But Jones says it is “a variant, perhaps the most destructive one, of forced labour, an institution that has led to millions of overwhelmingly male deaths throughout history.” More than 36 million military men died in the last century’s top 20 wars alone. Even today the Russian Army, according to Gendercide Watch, “remains a death-trap for conscripted men – though not at the hands of a foreign invader. As many as 10,000 soldiers die each year from hazing, assaults, murder, and suicide.” In Afghanistan in 2001, because the media blitzed us with reports – justifiably so – on how the Taliban oppressed Afghan women, hardly anyone learned how life was for Afghan soldiers. In pre-Taliban times, when Afghan women enjoyed many rights, war still took a heavy toll on the men. Of Afghanistan’s conflict with the Soviets that began in 1979, Tamim Ansary, a writer in San Francisco, said in a Salon article: “The refugees in Pakistan, those millions who lived in the squalid camps that spawned the Taliban, were mostly the women and children of the men who stayed in the country to fight the Soviets and die like ants.” Ansary omitted the fact that the vast majority of these males, many in their teens, fought because they were forced to do so, and that the requirement to risk dying “like ants” was not thrust upon females. The later advent of the Taliban and its oppression of Afghan women did not mean that males no longer had to worry about war, about being killed or horribly maimed in battle. For some Afghan men, their fate came earlier than expected from their own government, as when Taliban forces, preparing for their war with America, began conducting house-to-house searches for recruits. “Some recruits who refused to join up,” said the Washington Post citing a defector, “were shot....”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|\"...[I]f they [warring tribes] couldn't recruit able-bodied young boys, they simply kidnapped them. Most of the recruits were 12, 13, 14 years old, but some were young as 6.\" —*Wray Herbert, U.S. News & World Report, December 29, 2004*|\n\nTo better appreciate the gender dimension in military conscription, consider that some countries engaging in guerrilla warfare conscript boys young as six! In Sierra Leone in 1999, says Carol Bellamy, executive director of the UN Children’s Fund, seven-year-olds were among the 2,000 child soldiers who were under arms. Boys are often abducted from their homes, beaten, and told, “You either fight or we will kill you.” The humanitarian group Save The Children estimates that more than 1.5 million child soldiers – virtually all boys, by my estimate – have been killed in conflicts from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir from 1985 to 1995. Consider next that although often desperate for soldiers, the countries that recruit young boys rarely recruit, say, 15-to-17-year-old girls, who are much bigger and stronger than 7-year-old boys, emotionally as well as physically, and hence more combat-capable and militarily useful. ([The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061103001657/http://www.child-soldiers.org:80/) says, “In many countries, girls too are used as soldiers, though generally in much smaller numbers than boys.”) The reasons for the conscription of boys undoubtedly include chivalry and the convenience of same-sex armies. But perhaps above all, the nations using boy soldiers may suspect that if in the name of gender equality they equally conscripted girls, the number of people around the world decrying the use of child soldiers — and the efforts to rescue the children — would surge a hundred fold and possibly deprive them of a valuable resource.\n\nStill another broadly ignored government brutality that targets males, as Jones indicates, is the forced labor of civilians. “Throughout history and continuing in modern times,” he wrote in an April 2001 letter to the International Labour Organization (ILO), “the practice of forced labour has overwhelmingly targeted adult able-bodied men, leading to millions if not tens of millions of deaths. Despite this grim record, the ILO’s Forced Labour Convention designates one group and one group only as legitimate targets for forced labour [stress added]: these same adult able-bodied men. Article 11 of the Convention states that ‘Only adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years may be called upon for forced or compulsory labour,’ so long as ‘ they are physically fit for the work required and the conditions under which it is to be carried out’ and ‘the number of adult able-bodied men indispensable for family and social life’ is allowed to remain in communities targeted for forced labour. In addition, the ILO states that both the forced labour involved in military conscription and the use of prison labour are acceptable under the terms of the Convention. Both of these institutions, of course, target males close to 100 percent of the time.” As just one example of forced male labor, the International Committee of the Red Cross charged that during the Bosnian war, hundreds of people in Serb-held areas were “being forced into what amounts to slave labor in dozens of towns and villages....” The forced laborers were, “for the most part, Croatian and Muslim civilian men.”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Imagine the international community’s outrage if the ILO Forced Labour Convention designated only able-bodied females as legitimate targets for forced labor.|\n\nOn rare occasion forced laborers are women. Even then they are luckier than the men. Addressing the enslaving of black Christians in Sudan by Arab militias, newspaper columnist Walter Williams wrote, “They shoot the men and enslave the women and children.” His topic, like that of many who opine on Sudan’s troubles, was slavery. It was not the greater atrocity of men being killed. This atrocity he brought up only once, in passing. He then quickly returned our attention to the women and children. It isn’t difficult to guess what would have been his topic — or how much more vociferous would be the media and feminists — were the Arab militias enslaving the men and children and shooting the women.\n\nAn anti-female atrocity, one that is widely deplored by the media and thus made well known to the world, is “honor” killings or disfigurings of women who disgrace their families. This violence, while not state-directed, is still ignored by police often enough to be deemed virtually government-sanctioned. Covering the topic for ABC television’s “20/20” in January 1999, correspondent Diane Sawyer intoned somberly, “In Jordan alone, a quarter of all the homicides are honor killings, an average of 25 women at least every year.”\n\nThe male counterpart to honor killings is the “blood feud.” It is rarely mentioned in the media and is therefore almost unheard of. It is even more ignored by governments than honor killings of women.\n\nThe institution of the blood feud, dating to the 15th century and extant in the Balkans, Sicily, and Corsica, was established for the purpose of “cleansing honor.” Offenses to honor include calling a man a liar and insulting a man’s wife. Offenses are paid for, and honor cleansed, says Noel Malcolm, author of Kosovo: A Short History, “by killing any male member of the family of the original offender, and the spilt blood of that victim then cries out to its own family for purification.”\n\nThe blood feud has always exempted females, since killing a woman is considered an extreme violation of a man's personal honor. “The strongest taboo of all concerned the murder of women,” says Malcolm, “and any woman could walk through raging gunfire in the knowledge that she would never be shot at.” Conceivably, assuming Malcolm’s definitions of the blood feud and the “strongest taboo” are correct, a woman could kill a man in another family, then, to avenge his death, that family would kill not her but a male in her family! How quickly would the international community stop ignoring blood feuds if they permitted a man to kill a woman in another family, then, to avenge her death, permitted that family to kill not him but a woman in his family?\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Empire, blood feuds have returned full-throttle in Albania, where reconciliation attempts have seen limited success. “Every year,” says Adam Jones, “at least a thousand men and boys die in blood-feud killings in Albania alone; the lives of tens of thousands more are spent in isolation and perpetual fear.” Yet, in covering honor killings, ABC’s “20/20” kept its millions of viewers in the dark about blood feuds and about the vastly larger number of murdered males. It left them to feel outraged only at the “average of at least 25 honor killings of women each year in Jordan alone.” Apparently to “20/20's” staff, the murder of 25 women is more outrageous – and more news-worthy – than a thousand murdered men and boys.\n\nFurther exemplifying their greater mistreatment of males, governments often punish males more severely than females for the same violations of law. This was true of Afghanistan’s Taliban government, though the mainstream media painted the opposite picture with their exclusive focus on that government’s oppression of women. The Taliban’s penal code required that males be punished for violations by females. In December 2001, a Detroit-area television station ran a story about an Afghan woman who defied the Taliban by operating a school. When Taliban troops discovered her, they beat her father.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|When an Afghan man or any other man must endure brutality as well as shame for the religiously “inappropriate” or “illegal” behavior of his family members, we can better understand why he so strongly “wants to control\" his children and his wife: from his view, it makes more sense for them to be oppressed than for him to be both oppressed and brutalized, especially if for a while after being beaten he is unable to work and support them.|\n\nThe Taliban’s penal code also mandated that males be arrested for many other “violations.” “While a woman can be beaten if her face accidentally shows from under her head-to-toe covering,” writes gender expert Cathy Young, author of Ceasefire! Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality, “a man can be beaten if his beard isn't long enough. While a woman who commits adultery faces execution, the same fate awaits her male lover.” Men were punished even if they didn’t break a certain “rule.” Taliban forces systematically detained and executed male civilians in north-central Afghanistan to deter communities from cooperating with opposition forces. According to one report, Taliban troops were repeatedly described as rounding up unarmed men and boys from their homes and work sites and shooting them in the head. There were no reports of females being shot in the head to deter communities from violating the “Don’t cooperate” rule. Such punishments of Afghan males, unlike those of Afghan females, somehow failed to get a lot of coverage in the mainstream media, especially national television, the sole source of news for a huge number of Americans.\n\nSocial researcher Warren Farrell, author of the riveting [Father and Child Reunion](https://www.amazon.com/Father-Child-Reunion-Bring-Children/dp/0615223931), tells of the 1990 Associated Press story about Bobby Sherrill, who worked in Kuwait. When Sherrill returned to the United States, he was arrested, handcuffed, and taken before a magistrate. He had failed to pay full child support for ninety days. The reason? While he was in Kuwait, Iraq invaded the country and he was kidnapped and taken hostage for three months, during which his father paid some but not all of the support. This explanation failed to impress the magistrate, and he demanded an immediate cash payment. Because Sherrill did not have it on him at the time, he was jailed. (There must be an unwritten law somewhere that requires non-custodial fathers to always carry with them a large sum of cash.)\n\nWhat if Sherrill had been a woman? It is extremely difficult for me to believe she would have been treated so unmercifully for being unable to pay child support as a result of her being kidnapped, being held hostage for three months, and having no cash on her when arrested. Few magistrates would have had the will to jail her under such circumstances and risk incurring the public’s wrath, especially feminists’ wrath. Cathy Young would appear to agree. In Ceasefire! she writes: “There is a deeply entrenched habit in our legal system and our culture of treating female offenders more leniently....” If it were male offenders who were treated more leniently, no doubt many in the media and feminist circles would describe the situation for female offenders as an atrocity. Yet because it is men who are treated less leniently, little is said of it and few people realize that even in the United States, which is often called the world’s most civilized nation, mostly men are denied the civilized part by their government.\n\nCathy Young serves up another example of more severe male punishment: “When American teenager Michael Fay was sentenced [in 1994] to be caned for spray-painting cars in Singapore, the public debate centered on whether harsh penalties were too high a price to pay for public order. The fact that caning is imposed only on men was barely noticed. What if a teenage girl were to be whipped for a petty offense in a country where this penalty was reserved for females? Wouldn’t women’s groups, politicians, and the media have treated this as an outrage against women?” Young apparently thinks yes, for she wrote earlier in a Detroit News column, “...[I]t’s a fact that violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men.”\n\nAnd it is this fact — which is the worst sexism — along with stepped-up feminist pressure to end violence against women worldwide, that has influenced the international community to protest anti-female atrocities and abuses to the point that, as Adam Jones says of Canada’s female-focused mobilizing efforts around ex-Yugoslavia, “one could forget any other category of victim exists.”\n\n**While** the international community’s outrage mostly for female victims intends well, it helps perpetuate governments’ brutality against both males and females for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, there is little evidence to support feminists’ claim in recent years that the greater outcry for female victims has resulted in rape and sexual slavery being taken seriously as war crimes. Cathy Young wrote in September 1996: “‘It's about women and children being tortured and murdered,’ said a Court TV ad for the war crimes trial dealing with the horrors in the former Yugoslavia. Earlier this month, women's rights activists at the 7th International Forum of the Association for Women in Development in Washington, D.C., said the atrocities against women in the Balkans might not have happened if rape and sexual slavery had been taken seriously as war crimes after World War II. Let's look at what has happened to Bosnian men. Time after time, Serb troops would separate the adult men from the women and children, load them onto buses and take them to concentration camps. Many men were subjected to horrible tortures, even forced to sexually mutilate each other. Thousands were massacred. That such crimes were taken seriously after World War II apparently did little to deter the perpetrators.”\n\nAs long as the international community’s outrage is mostly for female victims, some warring groups may think eradicating males will more or less be tolerated if care is taken to safeguard females. But in reality, waging war on males while trying not to harm females is somewhat akin to dynamiting a garden in a vain attempt to kill the weeds but not the vegetables. As stated, women are often beaten or killed for trying to impede warriors’ all-important objective of slaughtering men and boys. Sometimes women simply have the misfortune of being in the path of marauding troops whose respect for life has been traumatized out of them because they have been, Jones says, “brutalized and indoctrinated into committing atrocious and genocidal acts against civilian populations or disarmed enemy forces.” They are not unlike the U.S. troops who in the Vietnam War massacred 300 My Lai villagers, including infants. Such hardened soldiers, realizing they have already committed war crimes against non-combatant males and that their own lives can be violently concluded at any moment, may only sneer at threats of prosecution for committing war crimes against females. Some of them, perhaps having learned of the international community’s demand for treating the sexes equally, may also have learned of the international community’s unequal concern for male victims of governments’ barbarity. Perhaps they are inwardly offended and angered by the hypocrisy and sexism – as a lot of female soldiers surely would be if the concern were mostly for males. “Why should I care for others,” they may think, “when no one cares for me?” Horrible as it is to contemplate, some soldiers may be embittered enough to react to warnings to tread carefully around females in the same defiant manner in which recalcitrants react to “Keep off the grass” signs.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|“In large part, the atrocities of war are committed as a response to the fear men feel. Terror and humiliation are the combustible fuels of rage.” — Patricia Pearson, *When She Was Bad*, p. 53 hardcover|\n\nHistorically, warring nations and tribes have attacked the enemy’s civilian population as a strategy to terrorize and demoralize. The idea is that if an attack on civilians is massive and shocking enough, an enemy nation might lose its will to fight and surrender, either on its own or under pressure from its citizens. One such attack is the mass sexual assault of women. It often succeeds in terrorizing and demoralizing because, to repeat Cathy Young, violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men. Thus, the more we protest only atrocities against women, suggesting that this violence is more psychologically damaging to a nation, the more we signal that, as Amnesty International puts it, “assault on a woman’s body [can be] used as a weapon of war.” It is true that were the outrage for male victims and female victims equalized tomorrow, the strategic value of assaulting women might not change for some time; the media- and feminist-fueled construct of women as helpless, vulnerable, and deserving special protection — like children — is simply too ingrained in everyone’s psyche. But the international community’s current trend of denouncing only or mostly the atrocities against females can, in the eyes of some warring nations, only help sustain the value of those atrocities.\n\nThe lesser outrage for male victims (it’s lesser largely because for many people “man as victim,” like “woman as victimizer,” is repellent) tends to reinforce – and may in part stem from – the view of males as disposable. Many of us see males this way, explains Warren Farrell, “because we have learned that the more effectively we prepare men to sacrifice themselves, the more we feel protected.” This need for protection, along with the need of a nation to show its will to fight and defend itself from aggressors, may cause many people to think men should be considered disposable. But this view of males carries a significant downside that seems to be rarely thought out. For every aggressive nation or group that “men are disposable” unnerves, it may prompt one or two others to prematurely reject non-violent methods of resolving conflict, and to choose war, setting in motion the atrocities that claim many lives of both males and females.\n\n||\n|:------|\n| [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622214727/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_1.htm): There is something about women’s role that is also never mentioned. Can you figure it out? Women not sacrificing their lives in war is never discussed as female privilege, as matriarchy.|\n||\n|We saw in the Canadian study of newspapers discussed above how violence against women was portrayed disproportionately to men’s, and was personalized even as men’s was at best a cold statistic.|\n||\n|Here’s why this bias hurts women....|\n||\n|When only women’s suffering is personalized, it motivates us to rescue the woman and assume the cause must be the man. So in problems like domestic violence we blame the man and ignore the male-female dance that leads to both sexes battering each other equally.|\n||\n|This hurts women because, when the man feels he is the assumed cause, he becomes resistant to counseling. He experiences the counseling as identical to his wife – unable to hear him. To him, the counseling is now part of the problem. No, it’s worse than that. Hope disappears, and cynicism appears. And it doesn’t stop there.... He feels both his wife and the system are ganging up against him. Now it’s him against the world, and that’s the set up for mass killings followed by a suicide, which is, and will remain, the male style until men become no more or less worthy as victims than women.|\n\n**Human** rights groups, feminists, the mainstream media, and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan must cease, as Prof. Adam Jones puts it, “hierarchizing human suffering” to the extent that, for example, “the mass rape of women is privileged over the mass slaughter of (non-combatant) men.” Politicians such as Sen. Hillary Clinton must understand that women do not become war's primary victims by surviving genocides and being driven away from their homes to squalid camps where they have the hope, however dim, of rescue and restoration. War's primary victims are, and have always been, the men who are killed — the husbands, fathers, and sons of the women whose lives generally are spared.\n\nThe international community must express an equal outrage for male victims of atrocities and other abuses. It is a matter not only of honoring true gender equality, but of curbing governments’ brutality against both sexes. As the nuclear age advances, it may also be a matter of preserving our very existence.\n\n***[posted Wednesday, 17 December 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029083745/http://battlinbog.blog-city.com/governments_violence_against_the_sexes.htm)***",

    "text": "I was raped on Wednesday and I just needed to write about it a little Why am I so focused on insignificant things? Why am I so bothered that I have to leave my favorite pair of thrift store jeans on a piece of paper spread across the bathroom floor? They cost me less than ten dollars and they were starting to get loose around my hips anyway. Why do I care when the detective and her partner take my bedsheets away in a brown bag? I got them with a coupon at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and the thread count wasn't even that high. Why do I fear that my nurse will judge me when I mention to her I dyed my pubic hair purple a few weeks ago after she clips away several strands? Why do I worry that calling the strawberry Zofran tablet I dissolved under my tongue an antiemetic will make me seem too knowledgeable about a process I've never been through? Will they think I'm lying because I circled around the parking garage a couple times across from the police station instead of just parking in a handicap spot right out front? Will they tell me it's too gray to proceed with charges? I had told him ahead of time that I didn't want a relationship or sex. I told him that things were moving too fast and I was still in love with someone else and I wanted to be celibate for the next year. I told him all of this before we met and he agreed that we should just be friends. And still he came through my door and hugged me and later said on the phone that I gave him mixed signals because I sat down on my bed. I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. I wasn't trying to send any signals. He started kissing me and I hadn't even looked at his face yet. So he kissed me and I kissed him back even though I didn't want to. And he slipped his hand under my shirt and grabbed my breast and asked me to take my shirt off and I did. And he gnawed on my left nipple piercing and I looked at him for the first time and felt disgusted. And my pants were off and I can't remember how they ended up down at my ankles. Did he do that? Did I? He's biting at my stomach and touching me and licking me and I don't want this. I keep turning away and he asks me why I won't look at him and why I'm hiding my face. I tell him I'm shy because I'm scared if I tell him I think he's repulsive he'll get mad and sometimes when men get mad they hit you. Sometimes when men get mad they kill you. So I just roll over and lift my comforter over my face like a child watching a horror movie. His pants are off and he's standing on my bed looking down at me and I feel small. I don't want to look at his body. He doesn't look like the person in the pictures he sent me. He doesn't even appear to be the nationality he claims to be. He wedges himself between my legs and tries to fuck me and I tell him no and I'm so proud of myself. And he's says \"ok\" and I'm relieved. I explain to him that earlier in the week that things got out of hand at a photoshoot and I slept with the other model and even though it was consensual it wasn't something I felt good about. And he seems like he understands and he says he's sorry about that and then he asks when I'd last been fucked prior to that. I keep turning away. He holds me, spoons me like we're some couple and not strangers that met less than half an hour earlier. And he's touching me again and I feel his fingers near my vagina and then suddenly his fingers are gone and his fucking dick is inside of me and my body slumps like a scruffed cat. I'm lying there, I'm a body, just a body, I'm frozen, he's thrusting into me and I can't believe this is happening and he tosses my body around like I'm not even a person underneath all this flesh. I don't know how much time passes. It feels like a minute or two. He doesn't ask me if I'm okay or if I like this or anything. It's like I'm not even there. And finally I'm able to speak again and I say \"I don't want to do this\". He says \"do you not like me?\" and I can still picture his fucking pathetic face when he asks me this and all of a sudden all I can do is cry and repeat \"I don't even know you I don't even know you\". He says sorry and asks if I want him to leave and I say yes and then he insists that he's going to take me somewhere and I tell him to leave. He asks to use the bathroom and I give him permission and he leaves my house and before I can even get up to lock my door he rings the bell and I realize his sunglasses are on my dresser. I'm wrapped in my comforter and I hold the glasses through the crack in the doorway. Why the fuck do I offer him such courtesy? I shut the door and run back into my room and cry and I want to scream but I don't because I think if I start I'll never be able to stop.\n\nYesterday, the day after, I bought a white pages account and looked up his phone number. He had never told me his last name, just his first name. It turns out it wasn't even his real fucking name. I thought he didn't look Spanish and it's because his name is Pakistani. And when you Google his name it looks like he got married a little over a month ago. He's a rapist and a liar and a piece of shit and I'm so fucking angry.",

    "text": "Help me help my wife who is dealing with rampant sexism at work? I read through the rules and I think I'm okay but please let me know if I should be doing something differently or posting somewhere else.\n\nSo here's the situation: My wife is a criminal prosecutor operating in one of the biggest boys club jurisdictions within 500 miles. She's been a lawyer for less than two years and works on a contract basis. I'm still finishing school so she needs to hold on to that job for the time being.\n\nThe problem is that she is being disrespected by her co-workers, defence lawyers, judges, and court staff on a daily basis. Despite graduating at the top of her class from a good law school, being incredibly good at her job, and highly respected by the women she deals with, her direct supervisors don't trust her and are constantly trying to keep her down. Comments about her attire, mansplaining, inappropriate conversations, limited opportunities, the whole thing.\n\nThe office is also understaffed and there are a million other issues making her miserable, including working 70 hour weeks. She's complained to management before to no avail and is feeling hopeless. She left a lot of money on the table to pursue this line of work and it's the only job she's ever wanted to do. Leaving now likely means she'll never be able to return. We also aren't in a position where relocation is possible. She comes home every day fuming and wondering how she can possibly keep this up and I honestly have no idea what to say. I'm incredibly angry about the shit she gets put through but there's nothing I can do to change that.\n\nMy questions are about what I can do to help her when she's not at work. \n\n1) Reading is her biggest escape, so I'd love to get her some feminist(ish) to read that might offer some peace and encouragement during her non-working hours. Any recommendations?\n\n2) Has anyone received comforting words while dealing with this kind of situation? I'm a straight, white, male and while I can certainly appreciate what she's going through, I can't offer a whole lot of perspective.\n\nWould really appreciate your help. Thanks a lot!",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "How to deal with catcalling-it's made me a reactive hot mess Twoxchromosomes, I need some advice on how to deal with catcalling? I know some women like it, and having spent time in countries where machismo culture is very strong I didn't feel endangered or nearly as angry in those cultures. I don't judge the women who feel sexy because of it.  But for me, I can't help but feel ashamed, righteous, humiliated and angry when it happens in my home city. Catcalling happens to me several times a day, no surprise here in New York.\n\n I'll go out of my way to avoid construction sites if there's one up ahead or if there's a group of men hanging out on the block. I try to dress so that I don't attract attention, and god help me when summer time shorts become necessary. I wish I could wear less covered clothing but every time I do I get way more attention and I regret my wardrobe choices. If I can \"feel\" a man's eyes on me as I pass by I can't help feeling disgusted, especially if he sticks his head in my path to leer at me as I pass. Some days I hate my face and body for attracting men, which duh isn't healthy. Among the most horrifying memories have been being followed down the street in the dark, cornered by groups of white men speaking to me in Mandarin (which isn't even a dialect I understand), Konichiwa-ed, grabbed on the ass, and jacked off to pants on and pants off. One time I gave some change to a guy and he had a blanket, I didn't realize he was jacking off as I spoke to him for a minute until he broke off mid-sentence saying \"UHN, I'm gonna come!\"\n\nIn part, I am angry because 3/4 of the time the comment I receive is about me being Asian, which I don't identify with as strongly because I'm a native New Yorker--not here to fill your passive Asian sex doll fantasy because I know just about as much as you do about China. Today, I lost control and I crossed a line for myself.\n\nA man was on his electric bike and whispered behind my ear, \"Hey pretty. Wanna come to bed sexy?\" Which I'm sad to say I don't consider that bad. But I reacted without thinking- turned around and shoved his bike down. He didn't even fall off, just put a foot down to catch himself and I lost my cool. Started yelling to him about how women don't like to be treated like objects. And he said, \"Don't take it so personally. YOU don't like it. YOU. You shouldn't be out here pushing people on the street.\" And then another guy came to his rescue and was like, \"calm down Mami, calm down\" (to further my outrage) and grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me away from bike man. I walked away.\n\nUgh, what should I do? I've crossed my own threshold here--My reaction was rash and violent, and when I get catcalled I frequently replay violent scenes in my head of what I could have done instead of just walking away and ignoring them. I don't normally spend time thinking about the attention I get from men, and my anger usually subsides pretty quickly. But today was a game changer--I reacted with the intention of violence, and even though he wasn't hurt it's clear this whole catcalling situation is clearly messing with my thoughts and behavior. If you also hate catcalling, how do you deal?\n\nTLDR; sick of getting catcalled to the point where it's fucking with me big time and I don't want to think or act violently, advice?",

    "text": "I've lived in Iran and in the U.S. Anti-feminists on both sides mirror (and feed off of) each other. Warning: Long post.\n\nI grew up in Iran but moved to the U.S. about a decade ago. You can say I've seen \"both sides of the coin\" as far as societal attitudes towards feminism is concerned. Here are some of my observations:\n\n* Here in the U.S. you often see people admonishing feminists for focusing on \"first-world problems,\" while women in developing countries are grappling with much more serious issues. \n\n\n    You might be surprised to know that a very similar argument is used against women's rights activists in Iran, not necessarily by the state, but by conservatives at large. Iranian feminists are told that their focus on the mandatory dress-code (including hijab), on [the right to ride bicycles in public](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37430493), or on [the right to enter sports stadiums](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/30/banned-stadiums-being-woman-iran) is frivolous. \"What's the big deal about wearing a scarf on your head?\" \"Are you so defined by your attire that a piece of cloth is going to oppress you?\" \"You are diverting attention from real issues by focusing on getting women to stadiums.\" \"Not everyone can afford a bicycle. This is merely a middle-class issue.\"\n\n\n    Iranian women are also told they should be thankful to live in a state that keeps them safe from ISIS, because things could be a lot worse. Sound familiar?  \n\n* Statistics around issues like the wage gap, rape, and male-on-female violence have been contested over and over again in the U.S. They are called bogus, misrepresentative, and at best inconclusive. Meanwhile, statistics on mortality, longevity and well-being are used to show that American women have it better than men. \n\n\n    You'd think anti-feminists couldn't use the same argument in Iran, but they do. Longevity is similarly female-skewed in Iran ([and in most countries of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#List_by_the_OECD_.282013.29)). So we're often asked: \"how come you live longer if you're so oppressed?\" These anti-feminists point out that [Iranian women have a higher penetration in STEM fields than American women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyguttman/2015/12/09/set-to-take-over-tech-70-of-irans-science-and-engineering-students-are-women/#7b9d107e44de). That Iranian women are not subject to compulsory national service, as opposed to some developed countries such as Norway. That Iranian women are [less likely to have body-image issues](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/09/15/347083281/covering-up-with-the-hijab-may-aid-womens-body-image). In a way, we're told that we have it better than some Western women in some aspects, so we should stop being greedy about pursuing other aspects. Sound familiar? \n \n* Iran's theocratic regime has often argued that women have a natural tendency to nurture, and therefore need to stay home and take care of their children. Recently, they've discovered the fields of evolutionary/developmental psychology/biology and try to argue this point from a \"scientific\" perspective ([non-English link 1](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iILWu2n5hOEJ:www.tebyan-zn.ir/News-Article/zanan/2010/10/10/5607.html+&cd=12&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), [non-English link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0JZm_2vbc)). [Sound familiar](https://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/837287933312909313)?\n\n* In the U.S., some people argue that family courts unfairly favor women, especially in issues related to custody and child support. You might be surprised to hear that there are similar arguments in Iran, not around custody (which almost always favors the father), but around [Mahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr). Anti-feminists have vehemently opposed and dismissed the mandatory Mahr payout as a law that disadvantages men, conveniently forgetting that the scale is tipped the other way in almost any other legal issue. \n \n* The red-piller ideology has also found its following in Iran (and other countries I imagine). I've seen an increasing number of my old college mates and friends turn to red-pill/mgtow-type communities, especially on reddit. They even have a prophet (Roosh-V, who was born to Iranian parents). You might wonder, what makes them think they're disadvantaged and oppressed by feminists, despite living in country where a woman is literally worth half a men ([+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#3), [+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#22))? Is the illusion of victimhood so pervasive that it can elude some of the most gender-privileged people on the planet?  \n\n* The Islamic Republic has repeatedly accused women's rights activists of being Western stooges, for defending Iranian women's right to dress as they choose. Feminists in the West are repeatedly called terrorist sympathizers for defending Muslim women's right to dress as they choose. Both arguments twist the reality and turn a very simple issue (the right to choose your attire) into a tool for geo-political conflict. \n\nI expect some of you to say: but anti-feminists in the U.S. *do* have more convincing points, seeing that their country doesn't deprive women of their most basic rights. The ridiculous rhetoric of anti-feminists in Iran doesn't undermine the fair points raised by anti-feminists in the U.S.\n\nWell I do agree that objectively and definitively, Iranian law is far\nmore backwards in terms of gender equality. But there are three points to keep in mind:\n\n1. U.S. law didn't use to be very progressive either. Progressive ideas had to be argued into the law, by people who fought for them. The law often doesn't change as long as public opinion around it doesn't start to change. In that sense, anti-feminist rhetoric in the U.S. is not as innocuous as it's made out to be. I'm sure 100 years ago when women did not have the right to vote, most people were able to rationalize it as a necessary disadvantage for women, similar to how denying women a decent maternity leave is rationalized now. \n\n2. It's always easier to judge a nation from the outside. But when you live inside a country, you are exposed to the nuances and complexities of social issues, and might lose sight of the big picture. For instance, a Swedish citizen might view the U.S. as remarkably backwards in terms of gender equality, when it comes to access to abortion and affordable healthcare, violence against women, representation in politics, etc. But to some people living in the U.S. the issue is not \"so black and white\" (to use a phrase so cherished by anti-feminists). Iranian anti-feminists use the same argument (\"it's not as black and white as the West would like to portray\") to justify their incredibly backwards ideas. Sometimes it's good to take a step back to look at the big picture. \n\n3. The Iranian regime has learned to play the Westerners' rhetorical game really well. For instance: studies [have shown](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/18/secondary-schools-girls-gcse-results) that girls perform better if they study in gender-segregated schools. The Iranian regime has flaunted these statistics in defending its segregation policies, *as if they segregated schools to help girls succeed.* This type of hypocrisy can be illuminating when inequality (in any context) is discussed: **It's not enough when things work out. Things have to work out** ***for the right reasons.***\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to look at the global context when issues of women's rights are concerned, and it's also important to see beyond the rhetoric.",

The posts pictured students and school employees and created a risk of substantial disruption at the school, the judge said.\n\n“These cases establish that students have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence,” he said. “They have an equivalent right to enjoy an education in a civil, secure, and safe school environment.”\n\nAn attorney for three of the students had no immediate comment. An attorney for the other two, Darryl Yorkey, said “liking” images does not necessarily express approval.\n\n“I think the judge took an opinion that many of us do in the older generations in assuming that a ‘like’ on its face is just that, ‘I like it, I approve of it,'” he said.\n\nHe said many of the students who were suspended over the images were Asian and were just trying to shock each other.\n\n“Taken out of that context, it definitely looks really bad,” he said. He did not immediately know whether his clients would appeal Donato’s ruling.\n\nA phone message left with the school district seeking comment on the ruling was not immediately returned.\n\nA male student identified in court documents only as “C.E.” created the account in November 2016 and posted on it over the next several months.\n\nOne post showed a screenshot of a female African American student that she had captioned, “I wanna go back to the old way.”\n\nC.E. juxtaposed an image on the student’s post of a white man beating a black slave hung by his hands, according to Donato’s ruling.\n\nSchool officials learned about the account in March. They called in mental health counselors to help calm students and contacted police over concerns references to lynching, nooses and the Ku Klux Klan in the posts could constitute threats of violence, Donato said.\n\nC.E. was suspended and later expelled. Donato upheld his discipline as well on Wednesday.\n\nBut the judge said the district went too far when it disciplined two other students. One followed the account but appeared to have done nothing else and the other commented that the account was “racism solely directed at black people” with an emoji of a laughing face, the judge said.\n\nThe judge overturned their suspensions.",

    "text": "Karen Straughan: \"In a patriarchy it's 'women and children first'; in a matriarchy it will be 'women, children and the woman's luggage first'\" Provocative quote from one of her radio appearances.   \n\nIs she right?  \n\nFeminist theory is based on the demonstrably [false](https://www.amazon.com/Privileged-Sex-Martin-van-Creveld/dp/1484983122) idea that men in power try to privilege men at the expense of women.   I'm somewhat puzzled how this bizarre notion has become dominant in academia considering it makes zero sense from either a biological or class based perspective.   Perhaps the relative unwillingness of male academics to debunk feminism is itself an example of chivalric impulses rooted in traditional gender roles.   Who wants to be the asshole who opposes a movement supposedly designed to liberate women?   Me -- that's who.  \n\nIn another incredible irony, it would appear that the history of the feminist movement actually disproves feminist theory.  \n\nConsider two scenarios from the 19th century: \n\n(1) Men living on starvation wages -- some of them dastardly \"straight white males\" from countries like Ireland and Germany and even mother England -- try to form a union.   Leaders have their legs broken.   Police beat them with billy clubs.   Pinkerton spies are sent in to set off bombs.   Men are hanged and engage in pitched battles with private armies.   Several decades and thousands of dead men later, men establish the legal right to form a union.   \n\n(2) Since they are responsible for providing for their wives and children under threat of imprisonment (not that such legal action was required for 99% of men, who WANT to provide for their children), men are given custody of the kids in rare cases of divorce.   Women write letters to exclusively male politicians asking them to institute the \"tender years doctrine\" because the current situation is making divorced women \"unhappy.\"   Male politicians -- those fiendish patriarchs -- respond by handing over custody rights to women, at the expense of their own sex.     \n\nNot only is feminist theory incorrect, it may have been based on a monumental act of projection.   Women who didn't particularly like men to begin with thought to themselves, \"How would I act if I were in power?\" and patriarchy theory was the result.   Studies have repeatedly demonstrated that males have out-group bias towards females, whereas females have in-group bias toward themselves.   \n\nThe majority of women have not yet demonstrated that they are capable of having anywhere near as much empathy for men as vice versa.   In fact, you may remember that episode of the View where Sharon Osbourne said it was \"marvelous\" when a woman castrated her cheating husband.  The entire female audience cheered.   Can you even imagine the reverse?   Men cheering on a man who sliced out his wife's vagina?\n\nWhat we now have is a group of men in overt positions of power (from politicians down to judges and police) enforcing what amounts to a [matriarchy](http://www.realsexism.com/).   This is fitting, since female forms of power tend to be indirect rather than in your face (plausible deniability), and women are more likely to use proxy violence.   The state is the most violent institution in history, and feminists are now in the driver's seat (or rather the passenger seat, giving the driver directions).     \n\nWas Karen right about the luggage quip?  Hyperbole?  \n\nConsider that we currently regard female irritation over \"manspreading\" a more pressing gender issue than the epidemic of male suicide.   Or \"Mansplaining\" a bigger travesty than baby boys having their genitals mutilated and the flesh used in female beauty products or men not being able to see their kids.   \n\nThis isn't a minor empathy gap.   This is an empathy gap the size of the grand canyon.   \n\nI certainly hope that women are capable of a great deal more empathy toward men than they have so far demonstrated.   I guess the success or failure of the Mens Rights Movement will determine whether \"patriarchy\" is actually necessary.   The current male-hating paradigm is based on privilege and narcissism -- but not of men.   Remember who keeps the electricity on the next time you talk about \"male privilege.\"   \n\nUnlike some red pill types I don't think the situation is unsolvable.   For example role playing exercises can teach women about what it's like to be a man.   See eg Norah Vincent.   I recently saw a reality show where women (all reasonably attractive) were forced to go into a bar and ask men out, buy them a drink etc.   A couple were turned down.    One woman said afterwards \"that was the worst day of my life.\"   The worst day of her life, spending one hour as a man, doing something that ranks rather low on the scale of shit men have to go through.   I really don't think women have the slightest fucking clue what it's like to be a man.   But they could learn.",

In everything they make, they hollow out a central place for death, let its rancid smell contaminate every dimension of whatever still survives. Men especially love murder. In art they celebrate it, and in life they commit it. They embrace murder as if life without it would be devoid of passion, meaning, and action, as if murder were solace, stilling their sobs as they mourn the emptiness and alienation of their lives.” –\nAndrea Dworkin [Andrea Dworkin, “Why So-Called Radical Men Love and Need Pornography,” in: Laura Lederer, ed., Take Back the Night, Morrow, 1980, p. 148]\n\n- “...[W]omen and men are distinct species or races ... men are biologically inferior to women; male violence is a biological inevitability; to eliminate it, one must eliminate the species/race itself ... in eliminating the biologically inferior species/race Man, the new Ubermensch Womon (prophetically foreshadowed by the lesbian separatist herself) will have the earthly dominion that is her true biological destiny.

That's why they've only ever looked at ways in which females are supposedly disadvantaged by the system (ergo, nothing to do with equality). \n\nThat's also why it is absurd to claim that \"feminism helps men too.\" Why would you want to help the people you consider your oppressors and class enemies?",

    "text": "MRA Demands The MRM is not yet in a position to make any demands.   But I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking the tide is gradually turning.   A documentary on the Men's Rights Movement (\"The Red Pill\") has received positive write-ups in mainstream newspapers and won awards at a small film festival.   An article was just published in the liberal NY Mag that acknowledged feminism's man-hating problem (though still painted men as historical oppressors).    Self-identified feminists have dropped to 7 percent of the population in the UK.  \n\nMRA's who've been at this for many years without achieving significant results are understandably pessimistic.   But at least some of the suggestions below are already the norm in other countries, e.g. shared parenting in ~~Germany~~ France.    As more and more women join the MRM and the conversation goes mainstream, I think some optimism is finally in order.   \n\nHere is my list: \n\n- Criminalize male genital mutilation.   The fact that hundreds of baby boys die from the procedure every year should be enough to ban it.   \n\n- End selective service.   Some tradcons may disagree with this, but the reality is that men have historically shown a willingness to fight for their countries if they are actually under attack.   At the end of the day, conscription is a violation of human rights.  \n\n- End the drugging of boys except in extreme circumstances.  \n\n- End gynocentric education models.   In Christina Hoff Sommers' \"War against Boys,\" she notes that education systems were changed in the 90's to favor girls.   As a result boys are now falling behind.    Teachers must acknowledge general differences between the sexes in terms of temperament, maturation, proclivities, etc.   We need much more physicality in school, much more hands-on learning, and when necessary some degree of sex segregation.   \n\n- An immediate end to feminist indoctrination in schools.   Boys are currently being taught that their gender is 'privileged', that their masculinity is 'toxic' and that men tried to oppress women historically.   This is child abuse.  \n\n- An immediate end to \"zero tolerance\" policies that punish boys for natural boyish behavior.  \n\n- More resources for boy victims of sexual assault, and appropriate punishment for their abusers, who are often female.   Education campaigns should also target men who think these boys are \"lucky\".   While some teenaged boys may be mature enough to handle and even enjoy sexual relationships with older women, the younger the boy the more likely it is that he will be harmed by such experiences.   A study cited by Karen Straughan noted that a majority of imprisoned adult male rapists were sexually abused by women as children.    Many serial killers also  cite abuse (sexual and otherwise) by their mothers.   \n\n- Recognition of mother-on child abuse in domestic violence.   This would mean that campaigns like the \"White Feather\" in Australia would have to radically alter their current exclusive focus on male perpetrators.  \n\n- Boys-only groups like the Boy Scouts should be encouraged; they should not be forced to be made multi-sex.   \n\n- Major efforts to recruit male teachers.   I do not support affirmative action in nearly all cases, but the current education system is in crisis.   Studies show that female teachers mark down boys and have a more difficult time dealing with their natural rambunctiousness.   Moreover, many boys are being raised in single mother households and have literally no positive male role models.  \n\n- In order to get more men in teaching, we must end pedo-hysteria.   It is absurd that in some districts male teachers are not even allowed to touch children, even if it's just a hand on their shoulder when the child is upset.  That is anti-human and does more harm than good.   Pedophiles will unfortunately continue to pursue careers involving children, and I'm not sure what the solution is, but I do know that it doesn't involve demonizing the 98% of men who are NOT pedophiles.   More controversially, it may be worthwhile educating the public that up to 40% of pedophiles are female; if women are forced to carry the burden of pedo-hysteria they may be more willing to do something about it.  \n\n- Speaking of pedo-hysteria, no more discriminatory policies like banning single men from public parks.   \n\n- An end to all scholarships favoring girls.   Girls are already doing *better* than boys in school and do not require scholarships.   To the extent that these programs are continued, they should have male equivalents.  \n\n- An immediate end to all campaigns terrorizing women into thinking there is a one in five chance they'll be raped on campus.    A crude joke or a clumsy come-on is not sexual assault.   This is not the Victorian era.  Feminists who spread these false statistics should be harshly condemned.    \n\n- An immediate end to \"affirmative consent\" madness and kangaroo courts on campus.   Affirmative consent makes all men rapists by default since that's not the way people have sex.   All sexual assault cases should be handled by police.    \n\n- An immediate end to \"safe spaces\", \"trigger warnings\" and anti-free speech campaigns on campus.   Grow the fuck up.  \n\n- No more state funding for \"gender studies\" courses.   These courses spread hate against men and are no more appropriate in academia than \"Nigger studies.\"   If gender studies professors and their financial backers insist on keeping these hate factories, we need \"men's studies\" equivalents that are rooted in science rather than feelings.   This does NOT mean that we can't value and celebrate the historical contributions of women, or specific ways in which women have been disadvantaged and even oppressed at various times and places in history.   \n\n- Anonymity for men accused of sexual crimes.   This is a controversial one.   The opposing argument is that it will discourage other victims from coming forward.   However I see no reason why a man should have his life ruined because some people lack the courage to do the right thing.   Look at the case of Gomeshi in Canada.   His life has been destroyed even after it was demonstrated in a court of law that his accusers were lying.   Feminists STILL won't accept his innocence.  \n\n- Severe punishment for false sexual allegations if they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.   Falsely accusing a man of rape is akin to libel, assault, kidnapping and forced confinement over a period of potentially decades.   Let the punishment fit the crime.  \n\n- Reform of rape shield laws.  This is another controversial proposal.   The logic behind rape shield laws is that promiscuous women shouldn't be doubted due their sexual history.   Fair enough.   However, these laws can be misused.  For example Marv Albert is widely considered a demented pervert because he was accused of biting a woman's buttocks during sex.   It turns out that the woman had a \"bite fetish\" and ASKED him to do it.  This evidence was excluded from the trial due to rape shield.      \n\n- A recommitment to due process rights in general.   Perhaps an education campaign about the history of lynching would help.   \n\n- Recognition of envelopment as rape.  \n\n- No more affirmative action in the business world.   Young women are now out-earning young men.   \"Positive\" discrimination is still discrimination.   As mentioned, I think male teachers qualify for an exception.   \n\n- Campaigns to get more women into dangerous jobs.   Men make up 95% of workplace fatalities.   Who am I kidding?  This ain't gonna happen.   However it might be nice for feminists to show some respect to the blue collar men whose labor allows them to live safely and comfortably rather than absurdly accusing them of being \"privileged.\"    I personally support strong unions to help ensure worker safety, but since this forum includes people from all political persuasions I won't make that a main point.   \n\n- Academics and journalists should be encouraged to analyze the earnings gap in the context of hours worked, taxes paid, social services allotted, danger of work etc.\n\n- Mandatory paternity testing.   Studies show that when men learn they have been raising someone else's child the trauma is worse than rape.   \n\n- Legal male parental surrender.   This proposal is the probably the most controversial and least likely to be enacted, even though the arguments against it are no different than tradcon arguments against abortion.   One feminist, Karen DeCrow, even agreed.   Perhaps we'll have to wait until male birth control makes the problem obsolete.   \n\n- Paternity leave.  \n\n- An immediate end to the Duluth and \"primary aggressor\" laws that allow male victims of DV to themselves be arrested.    Erin Pizzey has suggested that the majority of DV cases don't require arrests anyway, and are better handled by counseling.    Rare examples of actual \"patriarchal\" (or indeed \"matriarchal\") abuse can be handled as they currently are.   \n\n- Shared Parenting.   All studies show that it helps the kids.   Best interests of the child, right?    The single mother experiment has been an unmitigated disaster.    Let's celebrate fathers again and give them the rights to which they should already be entitled.    This will help women as well, even though NOW continues to oppose equal parenting rights.    \n\n- Alimony reform.   I'm not sure what this would entail but I do know the current laws are antiquated and absurd.  \n\n- No more imprisoning men who fall behind in child support or alimony.   Obama proposed such a change but it was blocked by Republicans.   Shared parenting and alimony reform would probably go a long way toward solving this problem.   \n\n- Help for men contemplating suicide.   Non-gynocentric focus in psychological treatment.   \n\n- Men-only groups should be encouraged rather than made multi-sex. \n\n- Some sort of attempt to redress the massive discrimination against men in the criminal justice system.   Men are twice as likely to be charged and receive 63 percent longer sentences.   According to Mike Buchanan, if men were treated like women in the criminal justice system then five out of six men currently incarcerated would be free.   Short of some sort of novel approach where a separate judge determines punishment without knowing the sex of the accuser, I'm not sure much can be done about this outside of education programs about female privilege and male disposability.    \n\n- Some sort of attempt to address the problem of prison rape.  \n\n- End the drug war.   Some tradcons may oppose this, but I see no reason why people (disproportionately men) should be sent to prison for smoking a plant.   The drug war also encourages organized crime.  \n\n- Speaking of organized crime: legalize prostitution and watch another revenue source dry up for the mob and the deep state.   Sex workers already want this.   The current Nordic/Canadian model, which criminalizes only the buyer, is opposed by Amnesty International because it just drives sex workers underground and makes their lives more dangerous.   If porn is legal then sex for money should be legal too.    \n\n- The UN gender equality index should be gender neutral.   Currently it only measures areas where women and girls are faring worse.    This led to the absurdity of Rwanda being placed at the top of the index after the genocide because most men and boys were dead (!)  \n\n- All government programs including the words \"women\" or \"girls\" should either be made gender neutral or include male counterparts. \n\n- State resources allocated to social problems should be based on incidence and severity, not gender.   This would include everything from health spending to money for domestic violence programs.   \n\n- End homelessness.  It is absurd that in the 21st century West we still have men living on the street.    Many of these men are mentally ill and/or veterans.  \n\n- More care for veterans.\n\n- No more demonizing men.    No more policing of male hobbies.   If feminists insist on continuing to demonize healthy male sexuality we should be talking about hypergamy at least as much.    By the same token, there is no \"toxic masculinity\" without \"toxic femininity.\"   If we are going to talk about ways that stereotypical male behaviors can harm society we should be doing the same with stereotypical female behaviors: damselling, blaming men, holding grudges, gossiping, failing to take responsibility for one's actions, using sex to exploit men, acting irrationality etc.   \n\n- No more lowering the bar to allow women into certain fields like fire fighting.   This puts people's lives at risk.  \n\n- Men and women should be celebrating all things male and masculine in order to correct the damage done by feminism.   We should be celebrating the glorious history of men acting courageously, making enormous sacrifices to help their fellow man, protecting women and children, creating art and civilization.    Boys should take pride in their gender rather than being cruelly shamed for it.    Women should be taught about their natural in group bias.   Celebrating men does not mean we can't also celebrate women.   It's time to end the sex war.    Feminists said they wanted equality: let's give it to them.",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 4: \"Sisterhood is still powerful\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n**\"Sisterhood is still powerful\"**\n\nWhen the slogan “Sisterhood is powerful” was first used, it was awesome. I began my full-fledged participation in feminist movement my sophomore year in college. Attending an all women’s college for a year before I transferred to Stanford University, I knew from firsthand experience the difference in female self-esteem and self-assertion in same-sex classrooms versus those where males were present. At Stanford males ruled the day in every classroom. Females spoke less, took less initiative, and often when they spoke you could hardly hear what they were saying. Their voices lacked strength and confidence. And to make matters worse we were told time and time again by male professors that we were not as intelligent as the males, that we could not be “great” thinkers, writers, and so on. These attitudes shocked me since I had come from an all-female environment where our intellectual worth and value was constantly affirmed by the standard of academic excellence our mostly female professors set for us and themselves.\n\n\n\nIndeed, I was indebted to my favorite white female English professor who thought I was not getting the academic guidance I needed at our women’s college because they did not have an intensified writing program. She encouraged me to attend Stanford. She believed that I would someday be an important thinker and writer.\n\n\n\nAt Stanford my ability was constantly questioned. I began to doubt myself. Then feminist movement rocked the campus. Female students and professors demanded an end to discrimination based on gender inside and outside the classroom. Wow, it was an intense and awesome time. There I took my first women’s studies class with the writer Tillie Olsen, who compelled her students to think first and foremost about the fate of women from working-class backgrounds. There the scholar and one-day biographer of Anne Sexton, Diane Middlebrook, passed out one of my poems in our class on contemporary poetry with no name on it and asked us to identify whether the writer was male or female, an experiment that made us think critically about judging the value of writing on the basis of gender biases. There I began to write my first book at the age of 19, Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism. None of these incredible transformations would have happened without feminist movement creating a foundation for solidarity between women.\n\n\n\nThat foundation rested on our critique of what we then called “the enemy within,” referring to our internalized sexism. We all knew firsthand that we had been socialized as females by patriarchal thinking to see ourselves as inferior to men, to see ourselves as always and only in competition with one another for patriarchal approval, to look upon each other with jealousy, fear, and hatred. Sexist thinking made us judge each other without compassion and punish one another harshly. Feminist thinking helped us unlearn female self-hatred. It enabled us to break free of the hold patriarchal thinking had on our consciousness.\n\n\n\nMale bonding was an accepted and affirmed aspect of patriarchal culture. It was simply assumed that men in groups would stick together, support one another, be team players, place the good of the group over individual gain and recognition. Female bonding was not possible within patriarchy; it was an act of treason. Feminist movement created the context for female bonding. We did not bond against men, we bonded to protect our interests as women. When we challenged professors who taught no books by women, it was not because we did not like those professors (we often did); rightly, we wanted an end to gender biases in the classroom and in the curriculum.\n\n\n\nThe feminist transformations that were taking place in our coed college in the early ‘70s were taking place as well in the world of home and work. First and foremost feminist movement urged females to no longer see ourselves and our bodies as the property of men. To demand control of our sexuality, effective birth control and reproductive rights, an end to rape and sexual harassment, we needed to stand in solidarity. In order for women to change job discrimination we needed to lobby as a group to change public policy. Challenging and changing female sexist thinking was the first step towards creating the powerful sisterhood that would ultimately rock our nation.\n\n\n\nFollowing in the wake of civil rights revolution feminist movement in the ‘70s and ‘80s changed the face of our nation. The feminist activists who made these changes possible cared for the well-being of all females. We understood that political solidarity between females expressed in sisterhood goes beyond positive recognition of the experiences of women and even shared sympathy for common suffering. Feminist sisterhood is rooted in shared commitment to struggle against patriarchal injustice, no matter the form that injustice takes. Political solidarity between women always undermines sexism and sets the stage for the overthrow of patriarchy. Significantly, sisterhood could never have been possible across the boundaries of race and class if individual women had not been willing to divest of their power to dominate and exploit subordinated groups of women. As long as women are using class or race power to dominate other women, feminist sisterhood cannot be fully realized.\n\n\n\nAs more women begin to opportunistically lay claim to feminism in the ‘80s without undergoing the feminist consciousness-raising that would have enabled them to divest of their sexism, the patriarchal assumption that the powerful should rule over the weak informed their relations to other women. As women, particularly previously disenfranchised privileged white women, began to acquire class power without divesting of their internalized sexism, divisions between women intensified. When women of color critiqued the racism within the society as a whole and called attention to the ways that racism had shaped and informed feminist theory and practice, many white women simply turned their backs on the vision of sisterhood, closing their minds and their hearts. And that was equally true when it came to the issue of classism among women.I remember when feminist women, mostly white women with class privilege, debated the issue of whether or not to hire domestic help, trying to come up with a way to not participate in the subordination and dehumanization of less-privileged women. Some of those women successfully created positive bonding between themselves and the women they hired so that there could be mutual advancement in a larger context of inequality. Rather than abandoning the vision of sisterhood, because they could not attain some utopian state, they created a real sisterhood, one that took into account the needs of everyone involved. This was the hard work of feminist solidarity between women. Sadly, as opportunism within feminism intensified, as feminist gains became commonplace and were therefore taken for granted, many women did not want to work hard to create and sustain solidarity.\n\n\n\nA large body of women simply abandoned the notion of sisterhood. Individual women who had once critiqued and challenged patriarchy re-aligned themselves with sexist men. Radical women who felt betrayed by the fierce negative competition between women often simply retreated. And at this point feminist movement, which was aimed at positively transforming the lives of all females, became more stratified. The vision of sisterhood that had been the rallying cry of the movement seemed to many women to no longer matter. Political solidarity between women which had been the force putting in place positive change has been and is now consistently undermined and threatened. As a consequence we are as in need of a renewed commitment to political solidarity between women as we were when contemporary feminist movement first began.\n\n\n\nWhen contemporary feminist movement first began we had a vision of sisterhood with no concrete understanding of the actual work we would need to do to make political solidarity a reality. Through experience and hard work, and, yes, by learning from our failures and mistakes, we now have in place a body of theory and shared practice that can teach new converts to feminist politics what must be done to create, sustain, and protect our solidarity. Since masses of young females know little about feminism and many falsely assume that sexism is no longer the problem, feminist education for critical consciousness must be continuous. Older feminist thinkers cannot assume that young females will just acquire knowledge of feminism along the way to adulthood. They require guidance. Overall women in our society are forgetting the value and power of sisterhood. Renewed feminist movement must once again raise the banner high to proclaim anew “Sisterhood is powerful.”\n\n\n\nRadical groups of women continue our commitment to building sisterhood, to making feminist political solidarity between women an ongoing reality. We continue the work of bonding across race and class. We continue to put in place the anti-sexist thinking and practice which affirms the reality that females can achieve self-actualization and success without dominating one another. And we have the good fortune to know everyday of our lives that sisterhood is concretely possible, that sisterhood is still powerful.",

    "text": "The real reason women are not represented in tech First, I want to clarify I do not agree with the basis that women are not biologically suitable for roles in tech. I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. \n\nLet's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. \n\nThis demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!\n\nBut why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.\n\nNerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.\n\nSo they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.\n\nCompare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.\n\nThis is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.\n\nUnless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

    "text": "Sharing a simple job search strategy that I think the vast majority of job searchers would benefit from Job searching is one of the most miserable activities known to man. I believe this strategy is more effective and less painful for a few reasons, notably that: it makes excellent use of your personal network and generates warm introductions; it allows you to hone and practice your sales/pitch/interview skills constantly; and it provides frequent opportunities for encouragement and self-affirming interactions. These are all rare perks in most job searches.\n \nI am not a career consultant or interview coach or recruiter. I am sharing as someone that has conducted several successful job searches on my own behalf, as someone who has hired and fired people, and as a former executive coach that has had a front row seat in many, many searches. In the last year I’ve also had a front row seat to the job searches of several very close friends as well as my spouse. \n \nI am not suggesting this is the best or only job search strategy, but if I had to bet all my marbles, personally, this is the way I would go. I am writing it down here in case you find it helpful. You can decide for yourself if it makes sense and you want to try it.\n \nAt a high level, this strategy is based off a technique from venture fundraising (I am CEO of a company that has raised capital from investors). In venture fundraising we say, “Ask for money and you'll get advice. Ask for advice and you'll get money.”\n \n> You can think of this strategy as the analog: *“Ask for a job and you'll get advice. Ask for advice and you'll get a job.*\n \nThe strategy goes like this:\n \n1. Make a list of contacts. These are people who have relevant skills, experience or network for your search and who like you enough to help.\n \n2. Email your contacts to ask for a 20-minute call or coffee date to get their advice and feedback. \n \n3. Meet them, describe your value proposition to employers, your skill set and your job search strategy. Let them react, and ask for advice and feedback.\n \n4. Before you finish the conversation, ask for at least one introduction for the purpose of further advice, feedback and brainstorming. (Do NOT if they know of job opportunities.)\n \n5. Repeat steps 2-4, continuously expanding your web.\n\n6. Follow up every 1-2 weeks with each contact on your list, to stay top of mind.\n \n7. You will get warm introductions as opportunities come across your network’s radar, moving you to the top of the pile immediately as jobs become available.\n \nAs you execute these steps, you're building an ever-expanding network of people who are now enlisted in helping with your job search. \n \nAs part of the conversation (step no. 3), you are actively pitching each person on your value, but you’re sneakily doing it under the pretense of getting feedback. People’s walls will come down and you’ll activate their desire to help. (I recently learned that this is one of the 8 core needs in Maslow’s hierarchy -- no joke.)\n \nEventually you will get introduced to someone who hires you.\n \nI know that the devil is in the details so if you want more details, keep reading. I’ve broken down the steps using a hypothetical example and provide some example emails and exact wordings you can use. However, remember that copying other people’s language is a good way to sound like a robot, so make sure to make these your own.\n \n****************\n\n**Step 1: Make a list of contacts**\n \nThe heart of your strategy is to build a network of people who are thinking about you and your job search, so you'll need a way to keep track of all these people.\n \nInclude column headings for:\n \n> Name - Jane McDougal\n \n> Organization - High Flying Avionics\n \n> Email - jane.mcdougal@hfavionics.com\n \n> Phone number - 212-867-5309\n \n> Who introduced you - [blank if she is your contact]\n \n> Action required - Yes\n \n> Next action - initial email\n \n> Notes - [none yet]\n \n**Step 2: Write an email requesting a phone call or coffee**\n \nHere's a template you can use:\n \n> Subject: Advice?\n \n> Hi Jane,\n \n> I hope all is well!\n \n> [As you know] I’m exploring new career opportunities [in avionics industry] and was wondering if you'd be up for a call [or coffee] in the next week or two. I would love some advice on my strategy and positioning, and, if you don't mind, maybe some ideas on people to connect with.\n \n> Thanks so much. If workable for you, I'm available [time block 1] or [time block 2].\n \n> Best,\n> [YOU]\n \nYou can change this template as you like, but keep in mind the principles at work here:\n* Concise: gets to the point quickly\n* Request is clear -- they know exactly what they're signing up for\n* Focuses on your desire for advice while getting their wheels turning on other contacts for you\n* Let's them know the type of advice you want so that they feel confident they can provide it (and not waste either of your time)\n* Provides scheduling options to reduce back and forth\n \nYou might also notice that the request is passive: there is no question mark. (\"Can we talk?\" vs \"I was wondering if we could talk.\") This is intentional. The passive request doesn't make the other person feel put on the spot for a reply and therefore makes them feel a greater sense of choice and autonomy in offering support.\n \n**Step 3: Conduct the meeting**\n \nI suggest approaching the meeting as follows:\n \n* Get connected. Depending on your relationship with Jane and your cultural context, this could take 30 seconds or 30 minutes. The point is, be human.\n \n* Get down to business. After you get connected, make a decisive and clear pivot to talk business. Don't let the conversation wander or avoid the topic. Jane signed up to help and it's your job to honor that contract. You can segue by saying, \"OK, so let me tell you about what's going on.\" Jane may do this for you by saying, \"OK, so tell me what's going on.\"\n \n* Set the agenda. Explain: \"Let me tell you about what I'm looking for and how I'm going about that. I'd love your input on both my approach as well as how I'm positioning myself.\"\n \n* Share your value proposition. Talk about what you're great at and what kind of value you believe you can provide. (You're doing this in the context of getting feedback, but notice how you've created an opportunity to pitch yourself!) IMPORTANT: Be prepared with a clear and compelling pitch. Ideally, Jane walks away with an unforgettable snapshot of the value you can provide, so that as soon as she learns of a good opportunity she will think of you. When you're done sharing, ask for input: \"What are your thoughts? How can I improve my pitch?\"\n \n* Share your job search strategy. Explain how you're focusing on warm introductions and meeting great people in the field, because you never know who is hiring. Ask: \"What do you think? Does that make sense?\" Most of the time Jane will affirm your approach.\nGet new contacts - Jane may offer you an introduction or two without being asked. If not, and if it feels appropriate, you can go ahead and say, \"Would you mind thinking of one or two people in your network who might also have advice and ideas for me?\" Notice how you're not asking Jane who is hiring (she probably won't be able to think of anyone) -- you're just asking for people with advice and ideas (which everyone has). This makes it much, MUCH easier for Jane, who provides a few names: Lamar Garvey and Samantha Marshall.\n \n* Write down the names, say thanks and let them know you'll follow up. Tell Jane that you'll send her an email that she can forward to Lamar and Samantha.\n \n*Let me expand a little on the idea of sharing your value proposition.*\n \nInside your head, it might be very clear what you do, what you’re good at, what you’re looking for, and so on. But other people are not. They need a “handle” of sorts, an extremely simple and memorable way to think of you vis-a-vis job search.\n \nTo that end, I suggest coming up with a few assets:\n \n* A pithy job search headline. E.g. “Embedded systems engineer passionate about avionics.” You should use this early and often, modifying it slightly so you sound human. \n \n* Three to five key selling messages with stories. You need a little meat on the bone for these conversations, but you don’t want to wing it. You want to make sure you hit the most important messages, and stories is the best way to do so. \n \n(What do I mean by a story? When I talk about my passion for great workplaces, I talk about the time I was 23 and bought some hip new shoes but wasn’t sure I could wear them on casual Fridays because they had white soles. I never forgot because I was so excited to show them off but was stressed enough that I didn’t wear them. This story brings home the idea that I’m passionate about people feeling safe at work in a few sentences. That’s what you want -- to reinforce your key points with a quick story or non-hypothetical example.)\n \n**Step 4: Follow up to facilitate the introductions**\n \nIntroductions are sensitive territory. If the introduction breaks down at any point it reflects badly on everyone. For that reason you need to pro-actively manage this part of the process.\n \nHere's an email template you can use:\n \n> Subject: [Your name] intro to Lamar O’Donnell\n \n> Hi Jane,\n \n> Per our discussion I’d love to connect with Lamar O’Donnell to get his advice. [Add a human and non-transactional reason why, e.g. “Based on your description it sounds like we’d hit it off, and given his sales experience I thought he might have some pointers on how I describe my value, too.”]\n \n> As context (feel free to forward this to Marty directly if helpful), I’m a lifelong software engineer with a passion for all things flying and avionics. I have 20 years experience in embedded systems (Motorola, Intel) and a burgeoning web development skill set. My LinkedIn, if helpful, is http://linkedin.com/yourname.\n \n> Thanks!\n> YOU\n \nThis makes it easy for Jane to forward the email, add a short note, and wait for Lamar and Samantha to reply. Then she can just copy you in on the thread and be finished.\n \nNow, you should add Lamar and Samantha to your list, and keep the ball rolling.\n \n****************\n\n**A few thoughts on why this approach works**\n \nIt’s a big deal to commit whole hog to a new job search strategy (you can only do so much, I understand). So, these are some of the reasons why the strategy works, and why you might consider giving it a try.\n \n**1. People want to help**\n \nPeople can relate to the sucky-ness of a job search. Saying that you're looking will activate the \"helper\" gene that lives inside so many people. If you're not asking your network for help, you're snubbing a whole bunch of people who could feel good because they helped.\n \nAlso, according to Abraham Maslow’s research, one of our 8 core needs is called Transcendence, the need to help others achieve their potential. You are tapping into a universal need here -- pretty neat.\n \n**2. Your request for advice is flattering**\n \nWhen you send out your initial email requesting some time and advice, your ask is flattering: you want their advice. People like to give advice because it suggests that who they are is valuable.\n \nBy the way, people may offer connections for the same reason: their network reflects well on them, so they will want to impress you with who they know by offering those contacts to you.\n \n**3. Your ask is small and clear**\n \nPeople are also much more likely to say \"yes\" to a request when they feel that the boundaries of their \"yes\" are clear. There is no slippery slope. Your request is for time and advice, and possible ideas on further connections. That is a clear boundary so easy to say yes to.\n \n**4. You get to pitch your value to everyone you meet**\n \nYou're pitching yourself at every meeting, except normally being pitched makes people resist. In your case, they're just listening to as to provide feedback, which has the opposite effect: they're listening more closely.\n \nThe process of providing the feedback will help them internalize and remember your pitch, as they will begin to get their fingerprints on it and take ownership of it. Now they can more easily think of you and advocate for you to others.\n \n**5. Making requests in person is 34 times more effective**\n \nMost people think an email request is about as effective as one made in person, but requests made in person are 34 times more effective (!!!). This strategy gets you face to face before you ask for introductions, dramatically improving your odds of getting access to valuable new contacts.\n \nHere’s a Harvard Business Review about this. \nhttps://hbr.org/2017/04/a-face-to-face-request-is-34-times-more-successful-than-an-email\n \n**6. Every opportunity has a warm introduction**\n \nUsing this strategy, everyone you meet is through a warm introduction. You can bet that everyone who ever posted a job online would rather meet a candidate through a warm introduction than an online portal.\n \n**7. Going through your network will improve culture/values fit**\n \nPeople you get along with are more likely to know other people you'll get along with. By meeting people through your network, you increase the chances that the hiring manager at the end of the chain is someone you'll also get along with.\n \n**Bonus: Get positive affirmation and build momentum as you go**\n \nThis human-to-human approach will provide numerous opportunities to be acknowledged for your value. As you solicit feedback on your pitch, each of your contacts will help you dig for the gold in your experience and continuously reframe yourself in an ever-more positive light. Each introduction becomes an opportunity for acknowledgement, as your contact seek to enlist their own contacts in spending time with you.\n \nGetting positive affirmation is NOT superficial -- it is an important and necessary part of building and sustaining momentum during your job search. Embrace and enjoy it.\n \n****************\n\n**To sum up, here’s what you need to execute this strategy**\n \n* Tracking spreadsheet (I like Google sheets or Airtable)\n* Initial outreach email template\n* Followup email template\n* A pithy headline for your job search\n* 3-5 key selling messages, each one with a story to illustrate\n \nAgain I am not an expert but if you have questions on this technique I’m glad to discuss in the thread.",

But I’m at the bottom of the ladder (level 1 engineer) and I’m having a tough time getting promoted because, frankly, I think everything I do is bullshit.\n\nI probably watched Office Space or Fight Club too early in my life. I feel like a real life Peter Gibbons sometimes.\n\nManagement tells me that I’m a talented engineer but I have trouble seeing a project to completion. I forget to follow up with people on who’s in charge of what, miss minor details required for fully finishing a feature, sometimes miss a meeting etc. These are all kind of related to the soft / managerial skills required to be a fully functional cog in the 9-5 system.\n\nUltimately, I want to maximize how much I earn. And for that I need to get promoted. But to get promoted, I need to work on the soft / managerial skills. And to want to do that, I need to believe that struggling in the corporate world is worth it. But I doubt office culture. I doubt the idea of a 40 hour work week. I think most meetings are useless. I think capitalism is flawed in that a handful of people control the majority of the wealth (our CEO made more in one paycheck than I will make in one hundred lifetimes).\n\nMy question is: can you help me buy into the things that I am criticizing above?

    "text": "There Are Only 23 Black Owned Banks Left in America > Black-Owned Banks Hit Their Peak a Century Ago \n\n> In late 19th and early 20th century, 57 black-owned charter banks entered the system\n\n> Black-owned banks arose and flourished in a period when African-Americans were kept out of other financial institutions, both overtly and through practices that effectively walled off their neighborhoods from other banks.\n\n> The sector hit a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when 57 black-owned banks and credit unions existed. \n\n> Six CEOs of black-owned banks locked themselves in a New Orleans conference room for more than a day in late 2016. Surrounded by papers, drawing boards and PowerPoints, the group strategized ways to reverse a trend 15 years in the making: the decline of their own banking sector.\n\n> The number of black-owned banks operating in the U.S. has been dropping steadily for the past 15 years and fell to 23 this year, the lowest level in recent history, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That has left many African-American communities short of access to capital and traditional financial services, according to some banking experts.\n\n> “We have a crisis among black banks,” said Doyle Mitchell, CEO of Washington-based Industrial Bank. “We met…to save the industry. To save ourselves.”\n\n> The 2008 recession hit the black banking sector especially hard, and if the current rate of closures of about two a year, as well as the industry-wide reluctance or inability to start banks, continues, black-owned banks could disappear entirely within the next eight to 12 years.\n\n> The trend is worrisome to some analysts who argue fewer banks serving low-income, minority groups could expand “financial deserts”—communities with few or no banking institutions—and increase the likelihood that black and Hispanic communities could become susceptible to redlining, a discriminatory practice that excludes poorer minority areas from financial services.\n\n> “These banks are banks that serve relatively poor neighborhoods,” said Russell Kashian, an economics professor who studies black-owned banks. “There are neighborhoods that if…the black-owned bank isn’t there, nobody is there.”\n\n> Most black-owned banks typically have a few branches in one city, although one of the category’s largest players, New Orleans-based Liberty Bank, has a multistate presence. Such banks comprise just a sliver of the overall U.S. financial sector, with collective assets of $5.5 billion, versus $16.3 trillion in the industry overall.\n\n> As a result, some economists question the significance of the sector’s decline. “Size-wise they’ve been small,” said Nicholas Lash, a business professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies minority banking. “So their total impact on black communities can’t be very, very large.”\n\n> Yet those who live in communities that have been served by black-owned banks say the impact there, both practical and psychological, is deeply felt. The most recent example is in Chicago, where Illinois state regulators in January closed Seaway Bank & Trust, determining that its financial health had so deteriorated that pumping in more money couldn’t save it.\n\n> “It was like air coming out of a balloon,” said Bob Fioretti, a former Chicago alderman who was previously involved in raising money to keep Seaway open. “People were deflated. Seaway was a standing icon of the community.”\n\n> Seaway, formerly Chicago’s largest black-owned bank, helped anchor the famed black business community on the city’s South Side.\n\n> Claire Adams, a former board president of a South Side Chicago housing community that was one of the first businesses to use Seaway when it opened in 1965, said she now fears that with fewer small, community banks in her part of the city, payday lenders and check-cashing institutions, which often charge exorbitant rates and fees, would be many African-Americans’ only nearby banking option.\n\n> “The only thing that’s left are these predatory institutions,” Ms. Adams said.\n\n> In some areas of the South Side, Seaway was the first bank some African-Americans had access to, making it a symbol of black enterprise and economic development, patrons say. Many speak of the bank with admiration, often mentioning a program that allowed children to open a bank account with a small amount of money.\n\n> “I [could go to] Chase or something…but I like Seaway,” said Nell Robinson, who has used Seaway for more than two decades. “Seaway was here before Chase. It’s a black bank [and], we have to pull our people up.”\n\n> With such concerns in mind, members of the South Side’s religious community raised more than $100,000 in deposits for Seaway in 2016. But the effort wasn’t enough. Seaway was sold to the State Bank of Texas, then sold again to North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union.\n\n> A prolonged period of low interest rates and intense competition, as bigger banks slowly move into underserved areas, have combined to contribute to the black banking sector’s decline, even after the recession’s end. Now a practical concern in Chicago and elsewhere is that, even if bigger institutions step in, they won’t be as accommodating in lending to black-owned businesses.\n\n> A survey of entrepreneurs by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014 found that 47% of black business owners had gotten the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites.\n\n> That survey also showed fear of rejection was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek needed capital at all.\n\n> “When I have an applicant that comes into my bank and comes into XYZ large bank, and they’re on the edges, there are things that I can understand and appreciate about their situation that XYZ large bank won’t, and that makes the difference,” Mr. Mitchell, of Industrial Bank, said.\n\nI feel like we have to do whatever we can to keep these financial institutions alive man. Some of these banks & credit unions have been serving us and our communities since before integration. No way we should let them down now by continuing to take our business to people who don't care about or respect us. \n\nI have an account w/ Industrial Bank here in DC which is black owned in fact it was my very first bank account ever. My parents are the reason for this, and I'm proud to say I still do business with them to this day.",

    "text": "\"Equality\"... or, \"When was the last time a feminist...\" I rarely engage a feminist for the same reasons i rarely engage with KKK, Muslim Jihadists, Marxists, Holocaust deniers , etc etc.\n\nThat said, feminists are far far more powerful and numerous than i'd like to admit (and not just in the West), and so i've recently started compiling a list of issues on which feminist hypocrisy truly shines. Y'know, for fun.\n\n\nSo anytime a femmy pulls the '**bububut we stand for equality**!\", i say:\n\n\n\"When was the last time a feminist seriously advocated equalizing...\n\n- the suicide rate?\n\n- homelessness rate?\n\n- mental illness rate?\n\n- drug use rate? \n\n- death rate from unnatural causes?\n\n- workplace injury and fatality rate?**\n\n- divorce rape rate? child custody rate? \n\n- time spent with family rate? or more generally: free time rate? \n\n- tax contribution rate? (remember, in general males contribute to taxes more than they receive in welfare, females are the opposite)\n\n- military conscription rate?*\n\n*this one is personal for me. In the country i come from, military service is mandatory for males. Imagine being forced to give up X number of years of your most fruitful, prime years for the drudgery/harshness of being a private. Yet NOT ONE of the feminists in my country mention a damn fucking thing to change it. But you know what they DO mention? The fact that males who've completed military service get networking/career opportunities that are not afforded to females.\n\nLet me reiterate that: the feminists are angry that females dont get the benefits of being forced into military conscription, but have zero issues with the female lack of obligation of being forced into conscription. \n\nYa gotta love these terrorists....\n\n\n\n.....anyone else think of other bullet points to add? \n\n----\n\n**EDIT: just to add on about the 'workplace injury/fatality' part:\nwhen was the last time a feminist advocated equalizing the gender ratio of blue collar jobs: the dirty/dangerous/unhealthy/isolated jobs that are dominated by men? \n\nwhen was teh last time a feminist talked about equalizating coal miner jobs, or garbage truck collectors, or bus/taxi drivers, or construction workers?  Nah, it's only the white collar jobs: CEOs, execs, board of directors, the presidency. \n\nEquality^TM !",

    "text": "Just watched The Red Pill, here's some random thoughts First and foremost, it was an incredibly intelligent yet *mild* look at both pro and anti MRAs. In the end, she stayed level headed, gave us a summary, concluded her topics and said she's not a feminist anymore. A total Streisand Effect, thanks to the protests, who led us to believe that this is hate speech. I expected to be shocked. I expected a Michael Moore style of biased editing from the filmmaker. I expected a big, mean slant against feminists. But nope, she gave both sides a chance, and all we got were mental gymnastics from our critics. \n\nThings you should know about this documentary, if you haven't seen it yet: She focuses on a handful of pioneers for men's rights and sticks mostly with them, while bringing in other interviewees. Some of the primaries: The guy from A Voice for Men; Warren Farrell; a guy from the National Coalition for Men; an ex writer for Playboy who lost his son in family court, and a British woman who started the first women's shelter in Britain and was later ostracized for being critical. Plenty others that I'm forgetting.\n\nAs for the rest of the interviewees: I loved the chillness of Girlwriteswhat at the bar and was glad to see her in this doc, although I wish she would've dressed a little nicer. The CEO of Ms. Magazine seemed smart and level headed, despite being a huge critic. Her focus is obviously on women, and that's fine. I simply wish her agenda would leave men alone, which it obviously doesn't. Those sociology and gender studies professors she interviewed were completely barfy.\n\nHey Big Red, how many times can you blame the patriarchy for everything wrong in your life? Do you know who you sound like? Black culture in the 90s that would blame \"the Man\" for keeping them down. But I see that you two have teamed up to blame white privilege and the patriarchy now. Smart thinking. Speaking of Big Red, even in a relaxed café setting, she stills comes off as bat shit crazy. \n\nI had to close my eyes during the circumcision scene.\n\nI was sooo so happy to see that she included that disgusting protest at the University of Toronto against Farrell's speech. I was on this sub when that happened, and I knew this event was getting us close to a tipping point against the misandry of Feminists and SJWs. Sadly, I noticed that some of the faces from the original vid were missing. That could be because she was pressed for time, but I think it was because they threatened legal action against YouTube and probably against Cassie too. That was another tipping point: When Feminists/SJWs realized that they're too chicken shit to come out from behind their computer and engage us in a rational manner.\n\nLastly, the video diaries were super duper important in conveying how she felt about this and how her aim was changing. Sometimes docs need a human element, and that's what she did. Without these logs, I think the doc would've lost a lot of its strength, and I'm gonna go ahead and say it: Having an attractive, blonde, white woman be the predominant face of men's rights in this film is the huge punch that we need.\n\nGood work, Cassie, and thank you very much for doing this!",

    "text": "A Day Without Men So I keep seeing news about women going on strike to show how invaluable their contributions are to the workplace, to society, to the economy, etc. \n\nI feel that the minds behind the strike didn't really think it through. \n\nWhen millions of people get through their day, have dinner, go to bed, and wake up tomorrow without being inconvenienced in the slightest by the women's strike all it will do is prove the opposite of the point they wanted to make.\n\nI am a supporter of equal rights for all, men, women, black, white, pink, purple, I don't care, equality for all means just that, for all, so please don't think I'm saying that I think, even for a second, that women are unimportant.\n\nBut imagine if we had a Day Without Men, a Men's Strike, a day when all the men in the country refused to work. Everything would fall apart. There'd be garbage piling up on the streets, public transport wouldn't be able to run, construction would grind to a halt, law enforcement would practically cease to exist, the military would do the same. What about slaughter houses that produce all the meat we eat? The kitchens filled with underpaid male immigrants? \n\nI'm sorry female Gizmodo writers, no one cares if you don't write for a day. The fact that you have the ability to not go to work for a day without everything going to shit exposes how expendable your position really is. All it does is highlight the dichotomy between true workplace equality and what all the third-wave feminists call equality. \n\nYes, gender inequality exists, I don't think it should, but historically it has. Men have been ahead in the game for millennia, but at the same time they have been stuck at the very back. Yes, more men hold CEO positions than women, but more men also hold the dirty, overlooked, under appreciated jobs that are the foundation that holds up the rest of society. \n\nThroughout history there have been examples of exemplary women who broke away from the norm and did huge things, who showed that women as a whole are not weak and can do great things. As we march ever forward into the future it is a truly great thing that more and more women are able to rise against any preconceptions that say they should stand by the sidelines of history. But I think it is too easily forgotten that the road that this march of progress, that this march towards equality for all treads  upon is paved with the bones of men.",

Now \"the party has a policy requiring any departing MLA to be replaced by a woman or 'equity-seeking candidate,' including racial minorities, Indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ community.\"   One poor sap had to claim he was [bisexual](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ndp-candidate-reveals-bisexuality-after-questions-over-party-s-equity-rule-1.3811299) to prevent losing his job.  \n\nThis is not \"justice\", social or otherwise.  This is just discrimination under a new name.   \n\nIn the UK, poor white males are now recognized as the most [disadvantaged](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34667100/poor-white-boys-get-a-worse-start-in-life-says-equality-report) group.  \n\nWhy wouldn't they be?  If you help every poor ethnic group *except* poor white people of course they'll become the most disadvantaged.  And despite feminist claims, men almost always occupy the very bottom rungs of society.   \n\nThe left has lost its way.  Whereas they used to focus on class and *overcoming* racial and sexual distinctions, they now seek to create maximum conflict between the sexes and races while the billionaires run laughing to the bank.   *Divide et impera* is the oldest trick in the book, and modern day leftists have fallen for it hook, line and sinker.",

    "text": "Trudeau, Trump find common ground on economy, security - Women in business round table The CBC was rife with pro feminist articles today.  But a section near the end of this article caught my attention.  Trudeau, and Trump (!), partook in a round table discussion about how to encourage more women in executive positions. \n\nWhat is this?  Why is this a thing?  The Apex fallacy annoys me to no end.  People are so dumb to engage in the idea that \"because there are more male CEOs, men are privileged\".  It's a dumb argument.  Should we have a round table to discuss how we can have more female coal miners?  Or taxi drivers?  Or how about more homeless females?  \n\nFurthermore, how does a male CEO make me privileged?  It maybe, perhaps, makes HIM privileged.  It doesn't make me privileged. \n\nThat's like saying that having a white male Canadian PM shows that men are privileged.  Ah, no.  Our PM is \"a feminist\", and constantly stuck in 2015.  That doesn't make me privileged.  In fact, the exact opposite. \n\nBut whatever.  Is Trump now buying into this propaganda too?  I thought Trump was the first to speak against the grain and not subscribe to bullshit.  So why would he participate in this round table?",

First, the letter in it's entirety, followed by my reply.\n\n\"Say Thank You\n\nSay thank you. Say thank you to the women who gave you a voice. Say thank you to the women who were arrested and imprisoned and beaten and gassed for you to have a voice. Say thank you to the women who refused to back down, to the women who fought tirelessly to give you a voice. Say thank you to the women who put their lives on hold, who –lucky for you — did not have “better things to do” than to march and protest and rally for your voice. So you don’t feel like a “second class citizen.” So you get to feel “equal.”\n\nThank Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul for your right to vote.\n\nThank Elizabeth Stanton for your right to work.\n\nThank Maud Wood Park for your prenatal care and your identity outside of your husband.\n\nThank Rose Schneiderman for your humane working conditions.\n\nThank Eleanor Roosevelt and Molly Dewson for your ability to work in politics and affect policy.\n\nThank Margaret Sanger for your legal birth control.\n\nThank Carol Downer for your reproductive healthcare rights.\n\nThank Sarah Muller for your equal education.\n\nThank Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shannon Turner, Gloria Steinem, Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis, Malika Saada Saar, Wagatwe Wanjuki, Ida B. Wells, Malala Yousafzai. Thank your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother who did not have half of the rights you have now.\n\nYou can make your own choices, speak and be heard, vote, work, control your body, defend yourself, defend your family, because of the women who marched. You did nothing to earn those rights. You were born into those rights. You did nothing, but you reap the benefits of women, strong women, women who fought misogyny and pushed through patriarchy and fought for you. And you sit on your pedestal, a pedestal you are fortunate enough to have, and type. A keyboard warrior. A fighter for complacency. An acceptor of what you were given. A denier of facts. Wrapped up in your delusion of equality.\n\nYou are not equal. Even if you feel like you are. You still make less than a man for doing the same work. You make less as a CEO, as an athlete, as an actress, as a doctor. You make less in government, in the tech industry, in healthcare.\n\nYou still don’t have full rights over your own body. Men are still debating over your uterus. Over your prenatal care. Over your choices.\n\nYou still have to pay taxes for your basic sanitary needs.\n\nYou still have to carry mace when walking alone at night. You still have to prove to the court why you were drunk on the night you were raped. You still have to justify your behavior when a man forces himself on you.\n\nYou still don’t have paid (or even unpaid) maternity leave. You still have to go back to work while your body is broken. While you silently suffer from postpartum depression.\n\nYou still have to fight to breastfeed in public. You still have to prove to other women it’s your right to do so. You still offend others with your breasts.\n\nYou are still objectified. You are still catcalled. You are still sexualized. You are still told you’re too skinny or you’re too fat. You’re still told you’re too old or too young. You’re applauded when you “age gracefully.” You’re still told men age “better.” You’re still told to dress like a lady. You are still judged on your outfit instead of what’s in your head. What brand bag you have still matters more than your college degree.\n\nYou are still being abused by your husband, by your boyfriend. You’re still being murdered by your partners. Being beaten by your soulmate.\n\nYou are still worse off if you are a woman of color, a gay woman, a transgender woman. You are still harassed, belittled, dehumanized.\n\nYour daughters are still told they are beautiful before they are told they are smart. Your daughters are still told to behave even though “boys will be boys.” Your daughters are still told boys pull hair or pinch them because they like them.\n\nYou are not equal. Your daughters are not equal. You are still systemically oppressed.\n\nEstonia allows parents to take up to three years of leave, fully paid for the first 435 days. United States has no policy requiring maternity leave.\n\nSingapore’s women feel safe walking alone at night. American women do not.\n\nNew Zealand’s women have the smallest gender gap in wages, at 5.6%. United States’ pay gap is 20%.\n\nIceland has the highest number of women CEOs, at 44%. United States is at 4.0%.\n\nThe United States ranks at 45 for women’s equality. Behind Rwanda, Cuba, Philippines, Jamaica.\n\nBut I get it. You don’t want to admit it. You don’t want to be a victim. You think feminism is a dirty word. You think it’s not classy to fight for equality. You hate the word pussy. Unless of course you use it to call a man who isn’t up to your standard of manhood. You know the type of man that “allows” “his” woman to do whatever she damn well pleases. I get it. You believe feminists are emotional, irrational, unreasonable. Why aren’t women just satisfied with their lives, right? You get what you get and you don’t get upset, right?\n\nI get it. You want to feel empowered. You don’t want to believe you’re oppressed. Because that would mean you are indeed a “second-class citizen.” You don’t want to feel like one. I get it. But don’t worry. I will walk for you. I will walk for your daughter. And your daughter’s daughter. And maybe you will still believe the world did not change. You will believe you’ve always had the rights you have today. And that’s okay. Because women who actually care and support other women don’t care what you think about them. They care about their future and the future of the women who come after them.\n\nOpen your eyes. Open them wide. Because I’m here to tell you, along with millions of other women that you are not equal. Our equality is an illusion. A feel-good sleight of hand. A trick of the mind. I’m sorry to tell you, but you are not equal. And neither are your daughters.\n\nBut don’t worry. We will walk for you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you. And one day you will actually be equal, instead of just feeling like you are.\"\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\nMy reply: \n\n\nI think you misunderstand the concept of \"equality\". \n\nEquality means that nobody is inherently considered to be better than someone else because of superficial qualities. It means that we have laws to prevent someone from using those superficial qualities as a basis for making decisions regarding opportunity. \n\nLet's examine your complaints one by one:\n\nYou list over a dozen women who should be thanked for fighting for the rights that women have today. Which, is all the same rights as men have (plus a few more). \nThen you double back and say basically that you can pretend that you have equal rights, but you're a fool denying all the work done by those before you.  So...  look more closely at that. The *ACCOMPLISHMENTS* of those women are what earned you equal rights. Yes. Say THANK YOU. Say it often and mean it, because you have equal rights. today. right now. You do. \n\nImmediately you plummet into the wage gap myth. Let's use some tired cliche' obvious answers of why this is stupid. \n1. If I could pay a team of primarily women approx. 75% of what I would pay an equivalent group of men, why would I not hire primarily women and save up to 25% on my largest expense as a business owner, human resources?\n2. The differences in pay between men and women in the sighted fields is normally on the level of 5 or 6 cents to the dollar. an amount easily attributed to a variety of things, but certainly not solely determined by sexism. I'll grant you that it is possible it is a factor, but if I were a betting man I'd wager an argument could be made to show sexism acounts for less than 1% of the discrepancy. \n3. Let's factor in the wages paid for jobs likely to harm or kill you. An industry happily left to men, who make up over 95% of workplace deaths. This means that jobs likely to harm or kill you are likely at least 90% men. Meaning that when you have no education, and you need to make good money, risking your life will earn you more money. Add to this the understanding that girls and women graduate high school and college in greater numbers than boys and men. \n4. young childless women, in their mid 20s, are out-earning their male counterparts. \n\nWomen aren't treated poorly in the workplace as a commonality. They gravitate towards different fields of work. There are anti discrimination laws, if someone is violating those laws, report them. use social media, expose them. Believe me, the world is watching, and very few of them would want to miss out on a chance to support a woman fighting oppression.\n\nYou go on to complain about men discussing your uterus, and your body...  So, what you mean is that men elected by a population of voters made up of men and women, where at least half don't vote, decide details of laws surrounding abortion and reproductive rights. \nCurrently you have the federal right to seek an abortion. You have literally hundreds of birth control options, ranging from hormonal daily pills, to semi monthly injections, implants, non-hormonal options...  etc. Many/most of these options are covered by health care, by law. Men have one option: condoms. Besides condoms men are told to either accept the risk of sex, or not have it at all. \nIf I meet a girl, she says \"I'm on birth control injections, and I would abort as soon as I found out if something happened anyway, I'm totally not interested in having kids at this point in my life.\". We have sex that night. we see each other another few times, and it kinda fizzles out. 4 weeks later she calls me and says \"I'm pregnant, and I know I said I would abort but I'm keeping it. It's yours\", you have no choice in the matter. You are now legally accountable for that kid for 18 years. \nIf you put that sort of lack of choice upon women, suddenly it sounds like the worst thing ever. Imagine, if a man could say \"fuck no, you're having this child, I'll take custody, and you pay me monthly to raise it, I know I agreed that abortion was what we would do if birth control failed, but I actually want a kid now, so you'll have it and I'll take it, and you help pay for it, and you can see it on weekends if you want.\"  no. If you said \"Well if you don't like the concept of being forced to have a child if you get pregnant, then don't have sex\".  This is literally the choice men have. We can trust a woman at her word, and then she can change her mind and we are legally responsible for that kid. This is not equality, not at all. when the suggestion of the \"financial abortion\" is made, that a man can tell a woman \"I will not raise a child with you, I am opting out legally from raising this child or ever having a right to be in this child's life\" you have to release that man from being a legal parent. This would have to occur within a time frame during pregnancy the same as a biological abortion. This allows women their choice of being single parents, or aborting in the case that they decided to keep an accidental pregnancy. This allows men to be held to their word, as well as women to be held to theirs. This allows equality of choice, and reproductive rights.  \nI also wonder where feminism is on helping to promote Vasalgel, which would greatly reduce the rate of accidental pregnancy in the first place, and give men a powerful option for birth control methods, putting them a step closer to women in terms of this right. \n\nTaxes on \"basic sanitary needs\".  you are talking about equality to men, right? we pay taxes on our basic sanitary needs all the time. razors and toilet paper and tissues, and talcum powders, and deoderants...  of course we pay taxes on those items. If you have a complaint that items like sanitary goods shouldnt be taxed, that is fine, I probably would support that. But I don't see how you believe that is an issue of inequality to men. \n\nThe letter talks after this about having to \"justify their actions after a man forces himself on them\" right. you have to recount exactly how it happened to the police, who will investigate the incident. You have to explain to police when there is a potential element of consent involved that you had clearly communicated you were not consenting, and how you did that. So the police will ask you detailed questions all about the incident so they can do their job as best as possible. You giving a strong account of an event will help your case. the police are trying to help you.  this is not inequality. If I am attacked by someone, and I break their nose and jaw defending myself, and yet I'm untouched claiming to have been attacked, I'm going to have some detailed explanations to make, aren't I? and here I am the victim, being interrogated!? Yes. Because your story is a very important element of the incident. \n\nYou follow this by mentioning that women don't have paid maternity leave. Do men have paid paternity leave? \nOh...  women in other countries have it, gotcha, Because this was supposed to be about how you're not equal to men, wasn't it? Sure, work to get paid maternity leave, work to get all the things you believe would improve out society. But don't claim it is a factor of inequality. Because it's just something you want the government to regulate about business, and you cannot simply stuff socialist concepts down people's throat without a spoonfull of oppression to make it slide down a little easier. This again is not an inequality, and I've yet to see an actual right you lack that men have. \n\nThe next topic is breastfeeding. I don't really know if there are any laws preventing this, but I'm fairly sure that most laws allow for it, making an exclusion to indecency laws for breastfeeding in public. I think people who give others a hard time for this are shitty people. It isn't something men do though, so it's not an inequality, it's also (to my knowledge) not regulated as being illegal. So it's mainly social pressure and commentary that is being complained about. Again, not a right being denied to women that is granted to men. If women want to urge the law to let them be topless as it does in various parts of the country, go for it. Just don't expect men to stop looking at tittys. That's never going to happen. \n\nThe next part discusses social pressures and criticisms of things like appearance and then references being judged for the brand of high end hand bag she carries rather than her degree.....  by who? BY WHO!? I don't know any men who would know the brand of the handbag, but they might judge you by your degree. A degree she is more likely to have than a man, on average, by the way.  You are judged differently from men on your appearance? probably. But if you believe men aren't objectified you're crazy. If you think men aren't catcalled you're crazy. You simply can't see what your feminist lenses filter out. This is not inequality. There is no law that can prevent how people see other people. and your depiction of judgement for the high end handbag over the college degree just stinks of your inability to see just how insane your privilege theory really is. \n\nNext up is spousal abuse and rape, followed by the privilege stack listing off people worse off than white men.  Let's take them one at a time. The deluth model makes sure men are arrested when they are the abused. The lack of men's shelters helps to ensure that there are no resources for men to get themselves and their children out of abusive homes. If they go to the CPS, they may lose their children all together, because of the lack of understanding of abused men in our society. You ignore half of the abuse sufferers because of their gender, and act like women are the ones who are invisible. Just google \"men's shelter closes\" and read.  That's feminism. that's your equality. You want to know a little nugget of info that should help you understand how much you don't understand this situation? Lesbian couples have the highest rates of spousal abuse. \n\nFollowing this you compare the USA to various other nations. \n\nSingapore, Estonia, Iceland, New Zealand. You understand that your request for equality is all over the map, you want to have the benefits of socialist systems for yourself, but you also idolize what some of the least diverse nations on the planet are able to do by being a strongly nationalist society. They have some of the most strict immigration laws in the world, while america remains to have one of the most permissive. None of this has any bearing on your equality to American men. \n\nThe next paragraph essentially creates a straw man out of the sort of person who would claim to be on equal footing to men in America. The author essentially paints a picture of a woman who says she isn't a victim, and doesn't see the world through the feminist lens. Then scoffs at this straw man, claiming she get's it. It's because these sort of women cannot bear to understand their victimized place in society, that these women who don't walk around feeling the victimhood of womanhood are simply too weak to handle the realities of our world, and their place in it. The existence of successful women, and the individuals who are doing well in life are tossed aside, with the explanation that just because a woman can make patriarchy work for her doesn't mean she isn't still oppressed... Right. It's amazing how the writer of this article can start off the list thanking all those who won her the equal rights she enjoys today, turn around and deny the equal rights she has, and then list off a bunch of factors that have nothing to do with equality, simply are issues feminism/some women have with modern society or government policy in America. Though not one can be held up as a right other citizens have that they are denied. Not one can be listed as a \"human right\" and not one can be looked at as anything more than a first world complaint when compared to what women around the world deal with. \n\nShe ends the list having never sighted one thing men have that women don't, but that she will keep fighting to make she she gets those equal rights, because even though you might feel equal in your life, you really aren't because you're eyes aren't opened, and focused through the feminist lens to see how horribly you have it.  \n\n\nHere is a list of rights women have that men do not: \n\nWomen are able to register to vote without a social contract of selective military service. Men may not register to vote without selective service registration. Failure to register for the selective service may result in fines or jail time. \n\nWomen have the only legal control grated over reproductive rights. Men have the option to use birth control or abstain from sex in order to control their reproductive rights. \n\nWomen in the USA aren't allowed to have part of their genitals removed at birth. Male genital mutilation is considered normal in the USA.\n\nIn several states, men cannot be \"raped\" by a woman. Rape is only considered to be penetrated, but being forced to penetrate is not called rape. Further, you'll notice when a little boy is raped by a woman, they call it an affair, or sex, but not rape. \n\nAnway, that's about it. Legally we are pretty much on equal ground. So when you discuss the issues, call it what it is. You are fighting for womens rights, and women's issues. But not equality. You thanked the women in the first part of your letter who gave you that. Maybe stop shitting all over their work by claiming it didn't accomplish all that it has. You have all the legal rights of men in your nation, and then some.",

    "text": "[Discussion] My industry seems to be hiring and promoting women more due to historical injustice. How is this similar and different than affirmative action in colleges? I just wanted to have an open discussion with y'all so let's try and hold back our biases. I should mention I am for 100% equality but do not think you should create inequality to do so, I'll explain.\n\nMy field has predominantly been male and moved female over the last couple of decades. Now it's fairly even, but the leadership is still majority men, like 70%. I feel this is due to history taking a while to run it's course, as you see the new entrants are fairly equal. Except now I hear the CEO of a certain employer is stating they want more women in leadership. It was not an official statement online but something we heard directly. I'm all for women leaders. But I am concerned with men losing out to these opportunities as a result. \n\nI find this argument similar to that of affirmative action for college admissions. I have mixed feelings but there is no doubt that I, a white guy in a small yet affluent town, had a totally better set of opportunities than say a black woman a few towns over who grew up poorer, etc. I feel that children (18 and under) have little ability to change their opportunities, so AA can help give people an equal footing their parents couldn't. It shouldn't be a kids fault they grew up in a worse place than I did. I didn't do anything to be so lucky. \n\nBut when it comes to workplaces, more so the promotions than the hiring, I feel that it's extremely unequal to promote a woman over me simply because they're making up for past injustices. I feel that if you have a college degree like mine and have the same job as I do, we are on an equal playing field. The promotion should be based on merit and work alone. It hasn't happened to me in any way, but I am wary because I'm seeing what looks like signs of gender preference at work. For what it's worth, I work with 70-80% women and am in fact the only male on my 15-person team. I am the minority which is an odd feeling. Not complaining however. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

    "text": "Essay on Feminism I need ideas on what to write my essay about. It has to be 3-4 pages long and I have to have 2-4 references. I sort of wanted to discuss women on TV and use the TV series \"The Lost Kingdom\" on Netflix (Great series if anyone is looking for new shows to watch) to help analyze some of these issues.\n\n Just a few things:\n\n1. I think women should have free birth control\n\n2. I think \"inequality\" in regards to the amount of women who are CEO's is not actually an inequality. Women are now starting to become CEO's and a change in the amount of women who are managers/CEO's is not something that is going to change overnight/within a year.\n\n3. I think the pay gap between women and men is a skewed statistic because there are too many variables involved (Workplace wage, Actual position at company, How long you have been working.\n\n4. I'm a believer that the way women are percieved by the media (magazines, news, movies, music, etc..) is very innapropriate compared to how men are treated. I absolutely believe that women are sexualized way more than men. \n\n5. I think women and men should be required to sign up for the army draft. I believe that women and men should be required to take a physical/mental health test that may exclude them from the draft if they do not pass the requirements (Too emotional, height requirement, suffering from various mental health issues, etc...)\n\n6. I believe in white male privilege in US society but other privileges exist too. I believe in privilege in general. Wherever you are, you or someone else has privilege (whether it's privilege by being thin, privilege by skin color, privilege by being a native or immigrant, privilege with socio-economic status, etc..)\n\n7. I don't think Porn has anything to do with feminism \n\n8. I don't think that violence against women has anything to do with feminism. I think violence as a whole is a issue with society and that if you are violent towards any individual without legitimate reason (Ex: self defense (physical and verbal-bullying), standing your ground) then you should be punished.\n\n9. I think one of the primary issues with women's rights is also that many women expect things to be equal while also expecting men to do various things for them such as: \n\n              1. Make the first move\n              2. Pay for things\n              3. Be Chivalrous\n              4. Fix things that are broken\n              5. Propose for marriage\nOnce these stereotypes are addressed and resolved it'll help balance things more. \n\n10. I think that there should be a divide in women and men when playing sports. I think there should also be co-ed versions of the teams.  This is not a gender equality issue, this is a biological issue.\n\n11. I agree with the movement of loving your body (both men and women do this, but I see that it is primarily women who discuss this the most). I do not agree with the idea of loving your body and finding it acceptable/okay to live an unhealthy lifestyle though. If you are overweight, you should strive to be as healthy as possible, not use \"loving your body\" as an excuse to not be healthy. \n\nAny and all comments are appreciated. If you want me to explain further into detail any of my opinions let me know ^. If you disagree with any of my opinions and would like to debate/educate me more/change my view then feel free to comment too. If your emotional because my post triggered you in some way (sorry if it did, it was not meant to in any way) and just want to tell me that I'm a dickhead, please do so in a creative way. I'm a huge fan of creative insults. \n\nThanks for the help",

    "text": "Hit a new low today It has been a struggle this year, to say the least.  Today was especially terrible, for several reasons.  My toughest group arrived to the gym completely out of control. Diving down the stairs, crawling on the floor, shouting in the halls, and blatantly disregarding all attempts by peers and myself to gain control and behave.  It took 22 minutes for the class to stop this nonsense and enter the gym.  Once they got in the gym they went bananas. I sent them back into the hall, told hem my expectations, and let them back in.  Again, total chaos.  Back to the hall we went, and I explained the expectations again.  We finally made it inside and STRUGGLED through attendance.  One student in particular was way over the top so I had administration remove him from the class.  \n\nI am so beyond myself with this class, I straight up asked them what it would take for them to respect me and to behave themselves.  What followed was the most disheartening question and answer I have ever heard.  The overarching answers were that they would only listen to their Dean, who is essentially the middle school principal.  They told me she is he only one they listen to when given directions.  They told me the only way they would stop interrupting was if they were all put in rows and made to sit out of reach from another person so they wouldn’t be distracted. And the worst answer, that most of class all agreed on was this: one student told me I need to “act black, and yell at us”.  She said that was the only way she would follow my directions.  I asked her to clarify what she meant, and she said black people yell at you and that’s how you can get us to follow directions. The other students, black and white, nodded and agreed. How unbelievably sad is that? These students literally feel that they should be yelled at.  I can only attribute this attitude to the dean.  She is a black woman, and she yells at them.  I have never experienced so little respect for adults by children.  These kids are 10 and 11 years old.  I’m meeting with my principal tomorrow and will discuss this with her.  I just can’t believe how low my class felt today.  I really have lost faith in my school, and in my career choice.",

    "text": "Did my school handle this wrong? Long post here. Yesterday as we were switching classes, there was an incident (which we all saw) in the hall involving another teacher. \n\nStudent A, let's call him Joe, calls student B who we'll call Chris, a stupid faggot. Chris walks up to Joe and says \"say that to my face one more time.\" So Joe looks him dead in the eye and says \"you're a stupid faggot.\" Chris jumps on Joe and the two start fighting. Their teacher runs over to Chris who she was closest to, and pulls him off, and he puts his hands up and walks away and says \"okay okay Mrs. T, I'm done fighting.\"\n\nSo now the teacher is standing in between both boys. Joe then jumps on her back and starts hitting her severely in the chest and neck. She manages to get him off and immediately sends both boys to the office, but she ended up with two pretty nasty bruises just below her neck.\n\nLater all 4 teachers get called to the office to give an account of what happened; we all saw it so the stories are the same. Principal takes a picture of the bruises for evidence and says the parents are on their way and she will let us know what happens. We're all thinking Joe will get kicked out for assaulting a teacher.\n\nLater we hear Chris is suspended for 5 days. Now we're just waiting to hear about Joe, and again we're thinking there's no way he'll be allowed to stay after attaching a teacher. Then we hear that Joe...is also suspended, but only for 3 days. The principal says it's because he has a behavior contract and he gets \"special exceptions.\" \n\nI know what a behavior contract is and how it works here. If the student breaks the contract, they're out. We had one kid break his contract when he got angry and called his teacher a \"white bastard\" and he was expelled about 10 minutes later. Another student was accepted at the beginning of the year, with such a bad history of schooling, and it was agreed between the parents and school that if he breaks even one school rule he's out. First day of school he walks in chewing gum and completely out of uniform, and was expelled that day.\n\nSo we have two students who were expelled for lesser incidents, and yet Joe only gets a 3 day suspension, less of a punishment than the other kid, for beating a teacher. All of us are just shocked, and upset that this student wasn't punished more severely. It's like the admin doesn't care about this teacher's safety. And this isn't even his first incident; he's been in so many fights with other students this year, fights that he started, that other kids are now afraid of him.\n\nTL,DR: student beat up a teacher and was allowed to stay with only a 3 day suspension, and got less of a punishment than the other student involved who stopped fighting, getting a 5 day suspension. All teachers are pissed.",

    "text": "How Many Schools Did You Work In Before Finding A Good Fit? What Were The Key Factors That Led You To Look Elsewhere/Stay Put? I've just wrapped up my 5th year teaching: 2 years in a small, affluent suburban district, and 3 years prior at an urban charter school in the bronx. I'm moving on to a small but elite independent school in NYC.\n\nI'm curious to hear experiences from vets who have settled down  in a position they intend to stay in, or other young teachers who intend to stay in the profession, but are actively looking for the best circumstances. \n\nDid you move around a bunch early in your career? did you persist through any circumstances that pushed you to the brink of staying in the position? What contributes most to your job satisfaction? \n\nfor me, my first position was too stress inducing because i was simply outmatched by the kids. I'm not going to act like I was in a legitimately \"tough\" school, but I was confronted with the almost cliche college white-boy in an urban classroom scenario - kids far below grade level and a lot of cultural conflict. What kept me going for 3 years were my colleagues and leadership, all of which made me feel like a was part of a professional community and gave me real job satisfaction.\n\nI looked for jobs and found a cute district in a well-off town about an hour outside nyc. Really idyllic setting, checked all the boxes you think about when picturing an ideal suburban public school job. What i found is an extremely isolating experience and highly negative teacher culture. Not a ton of \"blaming the kids\" attitude, but certainly a strong negative attitude toward policy that came from above. Also, an extremely conservative instructional regime, and an overall conservative, risk-adverse culture. I mean, the district leadership talked a good game about advancing our practice, but it was clear what was really demanded by the parents in the district, and acquiesced by the district leadership, was a clean, traditional classroom regime. The district has lost 3 principals in the last calendar year, including the guy that hired me and I really connected with. I have no confidence i'll continue to grow here, so im moving on. \n\nSo now im moving on again; i wouldn't have done so if I wasn't really confident this will be a step up and im very hopeful. But there is this concern in the back of my head that the job isn't just for me, that if this place doesn't work out, maybe it's not the school being a poor fit for me, but me being a poor fit for teaching. it's doesn't feel like that when im working with kids, but it can feel like that elsewhere in my life. \n\nWhat has your experience been trying to find a professional space to grow early in your teaching career?",

    "text": "How the Ford Foundation Created Women's Studies [link](http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readarticle.aspx?artid=14085)\n\n>Women’s Studies professor and feminist author Susan M. Hartmann credits the Ford Foundation with being a substantive force that created the feminist movement. In fact, Ford’s support of women’s studies and feminist causes is so extensive that it cannot be summarized in an article of this length. The subject is ripe for a full-length book. It is safe to say that without the Ford Foundation, feminism would not have been successful in gaining such a strong foothold in academia, and by extension, politics.  \n\nSee also: [The Ford Foundation and the CIA: A documented case of philanthropic collaboration](http://transmissionsmedia.com/the-ford-foundation-and-the-cia-a-documented-case-of-philanthropic-collaboration/).  \n\n>The CIA uses philanthropic foundations as the most effective conduit to channel large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. From the early 1950s to the present the CIA’s intrusion into the foundation field was and is huge. A U.S. Congressional investigation in 1976 revealed that nearly 50% of the 700 grants in the field of international activities by the principal foundations were funded by the CIA (Who Paid the Piper? The CIA and the Cultural Cold War, Frances Stonor Saunders, Granta Books, 1999, pp. 134-135). The CIA considers foundations such as Ford “The best and most plausible kind of funding cover” (Ibid, p. 135). The collaboration of respectable and prestigious foundations, according to one former CIA operative, allowed the Agency to fund “a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses and other private institutions” (p. 135). The latter included “human rights” groups beginning in the 1950s to the present. One of the most important “private foundations” collaborating with the CIA over a significant span of time in major projects in the cultural Cold War is the Ford Foundation.\n\nEdit: someone rightly took issue with the website on which the above was published (contains some questionable links on the side bar).  So here's the CIA itself discussing the same issues, in a somewhat humorously defensive tone: \n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no1/article08.html\n\nThe data comes not from the website but from the book by academic Frances Stonor Saunders, a British historian, as well as congressional investigations.    To repeat: there is no doubt, none, nada, that CIA has used philanthropic foundations throughout its history.   The same essay was published on other [sites](https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/FordFandCIA.html) as well.   \n\nFor those still skeptical, go to 26.32 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CFLpZcY3ss) documentary and you'll find an actual News report by CBS from the 1970's describing the scandal of CIA using philanthropic organizations as fronts.\n\nThis is not a \"conspiracy theory\".   It is part of the documented historical record.   \n\nIn Orwell's 1984, dissident groups (represented by Emmanual Goldstein) are actually controlled by the party.   By the same token, capitalist \"philanthropic\" foundations have long attempted to steer the left in certain directions -- specifically, away from class analysis and toward identity politics and postmodernism.   Feminism is their greatest triumph.   \n\nIt's ironic that so many people blame Marx for feminism, considering that the entire purpose of funding gender and ethnic studies was to reduce the focus on class.  \n\n>\"The Women's Liberation Movement may be considered as subversive to the New Left and revolutionary movements as they have proven to be a divisive and factionalizing factor.... It could be well recommended as a counterintelligence movement to weaken the revolutionary movement.\" This was from an August, 1969 report by the head of the San Francisco FBI office.[4] Within several years, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were pumping millions into women's studies programs on campus.\n\nOnce again I have to stress that this is not a \"conspiracy\" since it was done out in the open, although to the extent that CIA used these foundations to disguise their involvement in domestic politics, I suppose it may qualify.   Certainly the CIA's funding of Gloria Steinem and Ms. Magazine was illegal, since CIA is prohibited from engaging in domestic counter-intelligence operations.   \n\nThere are two possibilities here: one is that the great capitalists are just really enamored with feminism.   So much so that they bankrolled the certifiable nutcase Sally Miller Gearhart, founder of the first gender studies class and promoter of male genocide.  \n\nThe other possibility is that elites aren't quite as dumb and incompetent as many assume.  They recognized the gender war as an ideal way of neutering the left by dividing and conquering the working class.   Whether by design or accident or a little of both, they have succeeded.   Pseudo-\"leftists\" today talk almost exclusively about identity politics; they alienate the white male majority by labeling them privileged oppressors; and the traditional American left -- which focussed on anti-war activism, civil rights, free speech and above all class issues -- is all but dead.",

    "text": "IT Job Hunting 101 As I've been recently asked more than a few times here (and elsewhere) how I've managed to get laid off 4 times and never out of work longer than a month.  In fact, every time I've really set myself to finding a new job it's never taken longer than a month.  I've helped at least a couple dozen people in my field find new jobs using this method...so I thought I may post something that may be of help.  Even if you're not in IT, some of these tips may help you.  \n\nDisclaimer:  You may agree or disagree with what I've posted.  I'm not saying it's gospel, it's just what has worked for me and others that I've helped along the way.\n\n# IT Job Hunting 101 \n\n### I.  Resume\nFirst thing to do is take a look at your resume and understand there are 2 audiences that will review your resume.  The first is recruiters (either contract houses or internal recruiters).  They don't care about what you've accomplished as much as they're for keywords.  They don't understand the technical terminology (most of them), they just know what they need to find.  The second audience would be hiring managers and technical staff.  They want to know your responsibilities in your previous jobs and what you've accomplished.  I've refined my resume over years of asking recruiters, managers and technical staff if my resume was easy to read and understand.  Ignore the rule about the 2 page resume...it's crap.  \n\nOne thing about lying on your resume.  It's one thing to stretch the truth, it's another thing to lie...there's a difference.  If you lie, odds are you'll be caught and excluded.  But saying you can do something that you CAN do (even if it wasn't in production) isn't really lying as much as stretching the truth.\n\n\nAnyway, on to the resume format.  This format has had good success with the people I've helped to revamp their resumes\n\n\n\n    Date               Company                                City, State\n    Job Title (in BOLD)\n    1.  I start by listing responsibilities in a couple of bullet points\n    2.  Then I add accomplishments\n    3.  Typically, I end up with 7-8 bullet points\n    4.  Use terms like built, created, designed, deployed, implemented and managed.  Don't reuse terms if you can avoid it.  \n    5.  The last item is my technical environment which is not a bullet point but an entry under the last bullet point (and it lines up with the rest of the text).  Example\n    Technical Environment: Windows 2003/2008/2008R2,2012R2, Active Directory, ESXi Server 4.1/5.0/5.1/5.5, vCenter 5.0/5.1/ 5.5, WSUS 3.0.\n\nI always have a friend with decent English and IT skills proofread my resume before I submit it anywhere.\n\n### II.  Organizing your job search.\nI start with an excel spreadsheet with the following columns:  \n\n1.  Recruiter\n2.  Recruiter contact #\n3.  Recruiter e-mail\n4.  Position interested in/submitted for (this is important, many companies will exclude you if you've been submitted for the same position by multiple firms).\n5.  Last contact date.  It's important to maintain contact with your recruiter weekly (no more than that).\n6.  Step in the process (submitted, interview (list date), background check, offer, etc)\n\n### III.  The Search\nI really don't have any earth-shattering tips to share here...it's really a numbers game.  The more jobs you're submitted to, the more interviews you'll have.  The more interviews you have, the more comfortable you'll be with interviewing (and the better you'll perform).  If you don't have an established list of recruiters and contacts, you'll have to troll around Dice and other job boards looking for positions with your skill set.  Apply to those positions directly, speak with the recruiters.  Talk to friends in the field (and LinkedIn can help here).  Contact recruiters you've spoken to in the past about other jobs.  Be aggressive.  When I've been laid off, my full-time job was finding a job.  I'd be on the phone and searching every morning from 8-noon. \n\nBefore I hit a senior level in terms of skills, I'd message ALL of my LinkedIn recruiting contacts stating that I was actively pursuing new opportunities.   I'd also message the recruiters I've worked with in previously telling them the same.\n\n### IV.  Recruiters\nFirst thing is to be up front with what your salary requirements are and what type of position you're looking for.  If you're out of work, you can't afford to be as picky.\n\nI contact recruiters I've had contact with weekly (a week apart) and tell them that I'm sorry if I'm being annoying, but I'm really interested in XYZ position at company ABC and I want to know where we are in the process.  If you've interviewed, ask the recruiter if they've heard any feedback.  Most contract house recruiters get paid a salary and commission for placements...so understand that they really don't care about YOU per se, they just want to get the job filled. However, if you can build a bit of a personal relationship with them, it DOES help that they remember you.  I've gotten a few positions with recruiters I've maintained contact with over a course of years.  Many times they've thought I may be a good fit for a position and I was their only submission.   \n\nDepending upon your level of desperation, you should ignore recruiters that only e-mail you or only contact you via LinkedIn Mail (especially recruiters that are outsourced recruiting).  If a recruiter calls you, by all means pick up the phone and talk to them.  Good recruiters will call you and maintain occasional contact with you (at the point where you have a good relationship, e-mail is perfectly acceptable).  \n\nAfter you get a position, maintain contact with the GOOD recruiters on the list, give them leads on people you know that may be looking.  Keep this list and use it for the next time.  \n\n### V.  Interviews\nI can tell you that I've gotten most of the positions I've interviewed for...and that over 20 years and countless interviews, I've only really blown 2 interviews.  The first was early on in my career and there was a pen on the table and I started fidgeting with the pen.  I caught myself half way through the group interview, but the damage was done.  The second was a techical interview for one of the top companies in the field.  I was nervous about the position going in (because of the company AND the position was different than I was used to).  About a quarter way through the interview, I was asked to whiteboard the architecture I came up with (something I wasn't prepared to do) and I experienced total vapor-lock.  I forgot everything and fumbled around trying to draw it on the whiteboard.  Afterwards, I called a buddy of mine and gave him the lead on the position as well as the hiring manager I interviewed with and told him, \"Look, I know I blew the interview but I'm not calling you for that.  I do have someone that would be a good fit for the position.  Turns out my buddy did interview and did get the job.  The bottom line is that I've learned from my mistakes.  \n\nThe interview is where you set yourself apart not just technically, but personally.  They're not just interviewing people they want to do a job, but people they can work with.  \n\n1.  Prepare for your interview.  Know what the position is and what it entitles.  Know about the company (what do they do).  Try to find out if they have any other offices.  Find out how many employees they have.\n2.  Review your resume and recall the things mentioned on your resume as you'll likely be asked to explain those items in greater detail.\n3.  If you've been laid off, do NOT show up down for an interview.  If I can get away with it, I try not to let them know I'm already laid off (because you're subject to being low-balled if you get an offer).  But if you can't get away with it, it's best just to be honest and say that it's just business and it happens and smile when you say it.  Your mental state when interviewing after being laid off says a lot about you to your potential employers about how you'll deal with stress on the job.  If you maintain a positive attitude despite being laid off, most interviewers will be impressed.  How do I know this?  I've asked the hiring managers after I started the new job what set me apart (aside from my technical ability).  They've said my attitude was positive in spite of being laid off.  \n4.  Sit straight, hands in your lap or lightly clasped in front of you (no white knuckles..LOL).  Be relaxed.  Smile.\n5.  Ask them questions about the team, working environment, and technical environment.  You should be interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you.  Believe it or not, this does set people apart when they make a decision.\n6.  Bring examples of your work.  NOBODY does this.  I've brought examples of documentation I've written for environments I've architected.  I've also brought examples of code I've written.  I never provide the ENTIRE document or code (if they want that kind of thing, they can hire me). \n7.  Do NOT bring up salary requirements at your interview unless they ask...this is usually taken care of BEFORE the interview by the recruiter.\n8.  At the end of the interview, ask how you did in the interview and if there's anything more they'd like to know or things you could improve on in the interview process.  Again, this says something about you wanting to constantly improve.  \n\n### VI.  Social Media\n1.  LinkedIn - Use it.  Don't add everyone, add only recruiters you've spoken with (otherwise you'll get crap leads).  For every job you have you should get at least 1 recommendation (I usually shoot for 2...one from a peer and and another from a manager).  Tailor your skills and endorsements for your needs (remove things you don't like or don't want to do) \n2.  Facebook - Do NOT have your profile set to public and have pictures of you looking like a douchebag available for anyone to view.  That's the same with any other social media site you belong to...employers can and will look you up (even if it's unofficially).  \n\n### VII.  After getting the job\nGo get drunk.  Just kidding.  Hell you may want to, just don't drive.  Anyway, there's some follow-up stuff I do after I get a job (not immediately after...maybe 30 days after).  \n\n1.  I contact the recruiter and ask them for feedback on my resume.\n2.  I ask the people I interviewed with what set me apart from other candidates (so I can remember these things).  \n\n### VIII.  After NOT getting the job\nGo get drunk.  No really, go get drunk.  Not really.  Get your chin up and say, \"Next!\"\n\n1.  Find out why you didn't get the job from the recruiter the hiring manager or both.  Ask what they were looking for and what you could improve upon to get the position if it should open up in the future.    \n\n### IX.  Career-Building\nAs someone with 20 years in the field, I can tell you that until I reached a senior level position, my main goal when changing jobs was to do something a little bit different.  Early on, I was only doing Windows...but when I had the opportunity to work at a place that would cross-train me in linux, I took it.  That led me into doing work with VMware When I had the opportunity to do storage in addition to virtualization, I took it.  Stretch yourself...you should look at a job as a resume builder.  \n\nExperience > $$$  Until you get experience, money should be a secondary concern.  I've had 2 occasions that I took pay cuts ($5k) just to have an opportunity to do something I knew would pay off (it did).\n\nAdmittedly, I have a somewhat mercenary approach my career.   Part of that is because I've been the high-priced (at least from what they're paying the contract house) contractor guy and the first to feel the axe when cuts are made.  Because of that, I've come to the conclusion the only loyalty I owe any company is my time and quality of work.  Beyond that, I don't owe them a thing.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention...and this is also important.  I know the rule is don't talk salary with other people.  While you should NEVER discuss salary with co-workers...that rule doesn't apply to *former* co-workers.  Once you've left you can ask people in a similar position what they're making.  I know what my job pays for my area...both at the top and the bottom of the scale.  Why?  Because sharing information helps everyone out as it's easier to know your worth in the marketplace if you have those discussions with people you've worked with (NOT currently working with).  \n\n### X.  Giving Back\nI've done a few free seminars on this stuff.  I've been very fortunate in my career and I wouldn't be where I am without the help of others.  I've always tried to help people I know with their careers...finding new jobs, feedback on their resume, lists of recruiters, whatever.  I'm fortunate in that I love my career...I want other people to be happy in their careers as well.\n\n#### Special note for those unemployed workers out of work for more than 60 days\nI'm going to suggest you do the following.  That if you have a gap in your resume that you fill it with something stating you're self-employed IT.  You were doing independent contract work (using your skills) for small businesses or freelance work.  There's a stigma against having large gaps...because wonder if you're so good, why are you out of work?  Yes, I'm telling you to lie on your resume to get past the ridiculous stigma people have against people out of work.  When asked on an interview state that you've been doing whatever independent work but you wanted a more consistent level of work (pay).\n\nEDIT:  Added a bit about sharing salary info.",

    "text": "Working 40 hour weeks but massive facetime work culture. What to do? I work a white collar job, was recently moved to an interim department for on-the-job training before an upcoming promotion to a position in another department.\n\nI loved my old team, everyone minded their own business, not much small talk during work or even any attempt to be friends, but we would have drinks once a month. My boss was a good manager - very progressive way of working, didn't care where or when people worked, as long as work was done and deadlines were met.\n\nMy interim department is the opposite: straight up prehistoric. Boss of this department is a double-standard, hypocritical asshole. He wants butts in seats 8 hours a day (9-6) 1 hour unpaid lunchbreak, Monday to Friday. Working from home is explicitly banned NO exceptions aside from family/medical emergencies. Yet he does it pretty often himself, once he worked from home for almost a month straight because of a personal home improvement project WTF.\n\nThe result of the facetime culture is a lot of slacking off, surfing the net, Youtube videos on speakers, small talk and fooling around to kill time (boss' office is in a different part of the building). The distractions mean it's hard to get anything done. This facetime culture is fucking stupid, if everyone cut their shit out, they could be done in 5-6 hours a day and home early.\n\nThere's lots of guilt tripping if someone arrives late/leaves early, is missing from their desk outside of their robotic lunch hour (Very few meetings but a lot of \"desk work\"). Way too much nose poking into one another's business, like asking what time who arrived, wondering aloud if someone who called in sick was faking, overall toxic as fuck\n\nI actually am less productive despite spending more hours at work and significantly more unhappy now. With my old team, I would go the extra mile because I liked me boss, and wanted him to look good to his boss. I would work and reply to emails during weekends at home not because I had to, but because I felt bad for being in office 25-30 hours a week.\n\nThe good thing is I'll be done training in this toxic hellhole, moving to a (hopefully better) department and getting a raise at the end of the year. The bad news is that even surfing the net has become boring as shit.  I've started taking double lunch breaks to burn through \"time being bored\".

    "text": "Xenophobic-ish comments from a minority patient . Not sure how to feel about this. Background: I work in a city hospital that serves a very impoverished minority population . Our Institution isn't exactly stellar  , so except for Radiology and Surgery most of our residents and staff are FMGs or IMGs.  Me (FMG) and my posse ( Mostly FMGs)were doing our rounds. Being a Sunday , out team was providing cross-coverage and we had a lot of patients to round on. \n\nWe make to the ED to examine a patient who had come in with shortness of breath and  diagnosed with a PE. The patient was a black transgender patient. She had been in the ED for a couple of hours \n\nThe moment I stepped in the room my spidey-sense started tingling. Started off rough enough \" who are you ? why Are you here ? Why are  you rounding so late?.I'm short of breath\" ( while screaming at the top of her lungs).  Ma'am . I had 30 patients. i needed to prioritize , but you have my attention now . \n\nShe explained that she was basically ignored by the nurse ( which was true - was not hooked up to telemetry or SO2 monitoring ).\nI apologized to her and told her I would talk to the nurse and that she should take it up the charge nurse. So far nothing usual. \nThen she went off on a tirade  .\" My mother worked in this hospital ,I also worked in healthcare . Used to come here sometimes until I started getting my care in  *Brand name * Hospital . This hospital was  much better run when we had Real American Doctors, not all these foreign doctors.\" She repeats this stament verbatim again during the course of the encounter. \n\nNow my interns and resident are visibly disturbed. But she goes on . About how her usual hospital is much better.  I then remind her BTW, I'm also foreign ( my phenotypic  ethnicity is ambiguous- on a good day I can pass off for Hispanic/Italian . I was called \" white trash \" once ).\n\nIn order to diffuse the situation , I agree with all her comments. I  put in a few negative comments about my own hospital( I find this works very  well to calm down a an angry patient/family )  This eventually calms her down , and I manage to get a coherent history and physical exam.\n \nBy the end of the encounter I tell her \" Ma'am, I'm sorry you couldn't get a real american doctor today \". She then suddenly becomes apologetic.  \"Oh, I didn't  mean all foreign doctors are bad . Just like the cops you have good ones and bad ones  . You all have been very professional . \"\n\nI shake her hand and the encounter ends.\n\nI don't know how to feel about all this. My training tells me that the outburst was probably a reaction to the stress of being in a hospital and mistreatment by the ED nurse. She did apologize in the end ( cant vouch for the sincerity of it  though ) . She herself belongs to a very marginalized group ( Black M-to-F transgender ) but had no qualms or second thoughts about espousing xenophobic comments.  \n\n Throughout  my training I've been on the receiving end of irate patients .But this encounter left an especially bad taste in my mouth. I guess the fear of \"the others \" is a very primal urge. And all these civilities are just veneers on a underlying tribal  mindset. \n\nAt least I can watch the WWE Summer Slam tonight and get my mind off this .\n\nAnyone else here had similar experiences ? How would you debrief your residents/interns ?",

    "text": "I had a psychotic breakdown at work This will be a very long post. But I feel like it's worth reading. As fellow nurses, you all know that we stretch ourselves too thin. We work long hours. We have stressful shifts. We push our bodies and our minds over and over again. For our patients. For our coworkers. For our families. We all know that we should take care of ourselves. We all know we should eat better, exercise more, drink less. Stop saying yes to picking up extra shifts. Stop going without sleep so we can spend time with our friends and families on our off days. Of course we know all that. But we're nurses, it's just what our life is like. So we keep going. Until we break. This is my story about my break.\n\nI had worked 3 night shifts in a row. Nothing new. I've always worked nights. I hadn't slept well at all, also not new. I've been taking meds for insomnia for about 5 years. I was on call from 2300-0700 for night number 4. I had got somebody to cover the first 4 hours of my call because I wanted to go to a mystery theater dinner thing. The day after shift 3 I didn't sleep. At all. Just could not fall asleep, even with drugs.  I should have skipped the dinner and tried harder to get some sleep. But I was really looking forward to it so I got up an I went. And then of course I got a text saying they would need me at 2300. I was already so tired, my eyes were burning and my face was flushed. I was over emotional already. But they needed me so I had to go. \n\nI work in L&D. I've been at this unit for about a year. Before this I worked step down. I'm pretty comfortable in L&D now. Still haven't encountered a lot of things but for the most part I'm confident in my skills. When I get to work the unit is slammed. And there are 2 triages that had just come in that my charge nurse gives me. Both are rule out labor. As soon as I start working I realize I'm kind of off. I go to the supply room for something and totally forget what. I stare at a fetal strip forever before being able to analyze it. I forget where to go in our charting system to get to certain things. One of the triages is fine, going to be discharged. The other is 38 weeks and having contractions every 2-7 minutes. Her cervix is 2/60/-2. Her doctor happens to be on the unit for another delivery so I let her hang out on the monitors to wait to see what the doctor wants to do. So I start working on discharging the other patient. About half an hour or so later I've discharged the other patient and the MD gets out of the other delivery. She looks at the strip and says \"She's having lates. Why haven't you admitted her?\" I look at her strip (even though I'd been checking it regularly and it looked okay) and see she HAS been having deceleration. Go in the room and patient is obviously in pain. Recheck her she's 4/80/-1. I try to get an IV so I can start her bolus for an epidural. I'm flustered and scared, I have the volume on the monitor up and I can hear baby's heart rate keeps dipping. I can't get the IV. I go to get some help. The other nurse gets the IV quickly and I start a bolus, turn the patient to the left and put her on some oxygen. Strip still looks iffy but I just can't really get a good picture of what's going on. I don't know what to do. So I go out to the nurse's station and ask somebody else to take a look at it. \"Oh yeah, looks like she started having variables here. And then they turn into lates here. And now her variability is minimal.\" I start crying. It was like a faucet got turned on. I can not calm myself down and stop crying. Everybody surrounds me and keeps asking me \"How can I help you? What can I do?\" And I can't even think straight to know what to ask them to do. So my charge nurse switches around assignments and I give the labor patient away and get some post partum patients instead.\n\nThe next few hours are horrible. I keep crying randomly, my eyes are so swollen and my face is red. I can't concentrate on anything. I'm having a hard time keeping up with which patient needs what. All the nurses keep looking at me like \"You poor thing\" and being overly sugary and sweet towards me. \n\nAround 0530 thing start getting worse. I was looking at a nurse telling her something about the labor patient I had and I thought that I saw her eyes dilating and then contracting back. I kept staring straight into her eyes. I would tilt my head to left and then back to center over and over, all while looking into their eyes and seeing them dilate and contract over and over. I snapped out of it after about thirty seconds and was terrified. The nurse was obviously a little freaked out and kept asking if I was okay. I tried to shake it off and kept telling myself the shift was almost over. I'd be able to sleep soon. But then it happened again. My heart was pounding and I started hyperventilating. At this point all of the nurses are very worried about me. My charge nurse talks me into going to the ER. I try to call my boyfriend as my charge nurse walks me down to the ER but he doesn't pick up. Once in the ER ever person I interact with I think is in this little \"trance\" where their eyes glass over and dilate while I stare. I start to think that I'm somehow infecting these people when I look at them and making them go into a trance.\n\nThe get me back to triage quickly. My HR and BP are through the roof. I can hardly talk at this point. I'm trying to explain how I'm feeling to the triage nurse but every time I look at him he starts going into this trance. I really start panicking at this time. I keep telling the triage nurse to get help because I'm making him sick. I keep going over ACLS steps in my head because I think that either I'm about to code or this triage nurse is. My boyfriend calls me back at this point and I tell him to get to the ER because I feel like I'm coding. \n\nThey get me back to a room. Every single person that comes in I think is in this trance. They seem like they're walking slow and moving slow. Their eyes are glazed, pupils dilated. Speech is slow. The nurse and doctor step out at one point and I press the code blue button in the room because I'm certain I'm dying. My heart is racing, my chest is tight, I'm dizzy. And I see all these people in trances and I know I'm going to code and there will be nobody there to help me. I keep snapping in everybody's faces in hopes they will wake up. I'm screaming and crying. \n\nMy boyfriend shows up around this time. I look at him and even HE goes into this trance. I hit him in the chest trying to wake him up. I keep telling him I love him so much and that I'm sorry. I tell him he doesn't have a pulse and I'm so sorry that I've made everybody sick because nobody can help him. There are several nurses and techs and they're trying to hold me down and I'm fighting them. Hard. They try to get an IV but I'm moving too much. They then roll me to the side to give me an IM injection (Benadryl and Ativan). I'm screaming and fighting them because I don't understand what's going on and I think they're giving me something to kill me (because I'm making everybody go into this trance.) I get away from them and get off the stretcher. There are people in and out of the room constantly. They're trying to talk me down. At one point when there is nobody in the room and I sit against the door and try to barricade people from coming in. I manage to get my cell phone and I call 911. I tell them that everybody at my hospital is in a trance and they're trying to kill me. My boyfriend gets the phone from me and is trying his best to calm me down. I keep trying to drag him out of the room (I was trying to get out of the hospital because I thought 911 would be sending EMS). \n\nI start feeling weak and strange. I think that I'm starting to die from the injection they gave me. They're trying to get me back on the stretcher and into wrist restraints. I'm biting and kicking at this point. They try to put paper scrubs on me (I had taken my scrubs off by this point..dunno why). I think they're trying to put a hood over my head so I won't see when they kill me. They give me another injection (Haldol). I'm still trying to get up. Finally all the drugs start hitting me. I'm certain I'm slowly dying at this point. They tell me I've been PEC'd and start explaining things to my boyfriend. I think it's weird that they would bother with a PEC since they tried to kill me. I start feeling very drowsy and weak. They make my boyfriend leave the room since I'm PEC'd. He tells me he'll be back at 1300 for visiting hours. I told him \"Fine, but I'll be dead by then.\" The nurses slowly filter out as it becomes obvious that I won't need to be held down anymore. The leave a sitter in the room that looks terrified. I drifted in and out, at this point I have accepted the fact that I'm going to die and I'm just glad I'm going to be able to sleep. \n\nI sleep a bit on and off and slowly start coming to my senses. I realize I'm not going to die. I start getting scared that I've been PEC'd. My boyfriend comes back and I get him to tell me his side of things. Later that afternoon EMS come to transport me to a psych facility. By that time I'm pretty much back to my baseline. \n\nThe psych facility terrifies me. I'm on a general adult psychiatric ward. The first person to talk to me was a schizophrenic patient that was telling me that I was his daughter and was yelling at me because I took the elevator when he had told me to take the stairs. What in the fuck? I do not belong here. They start me on new meds for sleep (Seroquel). I sleep like a baby and feel fine other then being anxious about being in a psych ward. I think surely they'll let me go home after reviewing the PEC. I'm not a harm to myself or others, I'm not suicidal, I'm not depressed, I'm no hallucinating. Nope. I was there for 9 day. I don't know whether they held me so long because I was a nurse and they wanted to insure I was safe to go back to work. Or maybe because I had good insurance. I saw patients that were in for suicide attempts and active hallucinations leave before me. All medicaid patients. As a nurse, it was definitely enlightening to see this world from a patient side. I now have a very very negative view of short term inpatient psychiatric care. Now this could have been a bad example of typical units. I could write a book. Hell maybe I should.\n\nAnyway. I'm back to work now. Still on nights because I can't find an L&D day position. Thankfully we self scheduled on my unit so I've been able to make sure I don't work more than 3 shifts in a row. The Seroquel is helping with sleep, but I have already had to go up on the dosage for it to be effective. I'm terrified every time I work that I won't be able to sleep. I'm terrified that this will happened again. I never got an official diagnosis but I assume it was a severe panic attack with psychotic features. A small part of me wonders what if this was just a precursor to some psychological illness. All of the nurses on my unit have been so supportive. I still get weirded out at work sometimes, deja vu and what not. I still hate having patients in the room that that labor patient was in. I still feel weird around the nurses that were there that night. It was a terrible experience, I still remember most of it so vividly. The delusion of everybody being in a trance still seems so so realistic to me. I've talked to so many people about how it looked from an outside perspective. I wish I could understand exactly what happened. It's awful to have your mind betray you.\n\nThank you for anybody that read. It feels good to see all of this down in black and white. And please, take my experience as a warning. You are not invincible. You can not keep running your body into the ground. One day your body and mind will say \"Enough.\"",

    "text": "Anyone else have family that just doesn’t get how hard constantly swapping between days and nights is? Sorry for the long-ass rant, but I’m busy not sleeping for nights and I’m tired and frustrated. \n\nLast week, after coming off a couple 12 hour nights, my husband decided to wake me up to ask me a stupid question two hours after I’ve gone to sleep. This is my first “day off” - I got off work that morning at 0730, slept about 4 hours, got up, picked the kids up, did dinner, and then took a melatonin around 2030 to help me get a solid night. Of course, at that point, I’d gotten enough sleep that my body was like “okay, back to work”, and I was awake until 6AM. Of course, having only had about 5 hours of interrupted sleep in the last 36 hours at that point, I had to sleep for most of the next day. I was back on nights the day after that, so there was no point in fighting to stay awake and get back into a daytime schedule at that point. \n\nI was livid with him for waking me. When you only have two days off in a week with five night shifts, those days are important! Instead of being able to see daylight, spend waking hours with my kids, get errands run, and do some meal prep, I got to stay on nights, not see anyone, not get stuff done, and continue living with that low-grade feeling if “ick” that comes with nightshifts for another three days, plus the time it took to get turned around at the end of it. \n\nI managed to successfully get back on a daytime schedule for my days off. Following my third and final nightshift for that set, I stayed awake from the moment I came home, but closed my eyes sitting upright in a chair for about an hour and a half when I couldn’t fight exhaustion any longer. I felt like absolute shit, but I was terrified of missing out on my two days off if I couldn’t sleep that night. I baked, I shopped, I crafted my kid’s Halloween costumes, I meal prepped, I cleaned. \n\nI felt refreshed going into the last two night shifts of my two on/two off/three on/two off/two on run of night shifts. Last night was the first of two. This morning, I came home around 0800, had breakfast, watched half an hour of TV and settled in around 0930 to try and get a solid 8. I rarely am able to sleep much before my first night shift, so I rely on a good sleep between shifts to keep me going. \n\nAt 1515, my dad comes home from picking the kids up early - my son was feeling sick, so the school had called my husband at work, and he asked my dad to pick him up as he was at a truck repair shop picking up a driver and couldn’t get there soon enough. He didn’t give my dad any instructions on what to do with our son, despite the fact that my parents were watching my sister’s kids too and my son would have to be in our home so as not to infect his cousins. My dad comes and knocks at the bedroom door and I get to wake up, run next door to my sister’s place to grab zofran (she’s also a nurse, working days), put blankets and towels on the couch, get the barf bucket, put the iPad in a ziplock bag with an alarm and a timer, and instruct my son to start raking small sips every five minutes using the timer once the alarm goes off, and go back to bed. \n\nI am almost asleep when my husband gets home. He comes in the house, checks on our son, walks to the front door, hollers across the yard got our other son to come home, goes over to our old truck with a noisy 454 big block engine, turns it on and revs it for a bit, and then starts doing mechanical work on it. I can sleep through noise once I’m asleep, but this sudden onset of perfectly spaced out noise was enough to rob me of a chance at getting another hour and a half. Now I’m going back on nights with only 5 hours of sleep in the last 36. \n\nHis response when I tearfully lost it on him? “I didn’t think noise bugged you when you were sleeping.” Except I wasn’t sleeping. I was trying to get to sleep after waking up and having to run around for an hour and then going back to bed, so I’m already slightly charged up. He knows that I’m sensitive to noise when trying to get to sleep and that ear plugs and and white noise don’t do much for me. “I thought your dad would just know not to wake you up.” Ummm, with no instructions on how to medicate and manage our vomiting child? \n\nI’m so tired, but it’s 1820 and I’m on at 1930 and there’s already been one sick call for nights. Tell me your stories. Give me your tips. Tell me I’m only a tiny bit petty for setting alarms to go off every two hours tonight while I’m at work so he can gain some perspective. \n\nEdit: It’s 0654 and I made it! What’s more, I got in a solid 20 minute nap. Thanks to all of you for sharing your stories and commiserating - it made the night all that much better.",

    "text": "Looking for honest opinions. Male nurse here. I have been a nurse for about 6 years but at every hospital, I have ended up having issues with the same type of nurse. Usually a very masculine acting, type A personality female nurse. I want to remedy this because it's effecting my career. I think it has to do with the way I look and my personality. I a 6'4, 245 pounds and would be a type A personality, have always been self conscious because of my size but whatever I am doing still isn't working I always get complaints from usually that same nurse over and over again until a bullseye is put on my back, then I will eventually get into trouble. The complaints are never about my ability, it's usually that I don't show enough urgency during emergencies. Which I don't, because having prior EMS experience, I don't want to act too high strung so as to not make the patient even more scared. I have never had a patient complaint. It has to been something that I'm doing  but I have no idea what it is. Another thing that happens, is if I am doing something wrong, no one ever brings it up to my face, but goes to management. When it would be something I would have corrected before it got to that point. I like nursing, but this has happened more than a few times so I want to correct it. My first thought, and the other nurses that I get along with say it's discrimination, but as everyone knows, as a white male, you can't bring that up. Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice. I really want to correct whatever I am doing. Sometimes I think if I was a feminine acting male nurse that was 5'7, instead of my size. The thing that throws me off is patients love me, they really do. I get compliments and letters all the time. I am just really depressed about this and don't want to leave nursing. Thanks in advance guys (and gals).",

    "text": "Making work friends? Something that has really been bothering me lately is that I don't feel like I am friends with anyone from work. There is 1 person that I hang out with *occasionally* (as in like once every few months) and that is it. I try to be social, invite people out places, try to include myself in plans, attend work-organized social events, etc. But I never get the effort returned. I am never included on people's plans, I am never invited out.. Nothing. Even when they are sitting and making the plans right in front of me. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm still kind of new (1 year)...but there are people who have been there less time than I that get invited out. Maybe it's because I'm a guy in a female dominated profession. Maybe it's because I work swing shift. Maybe it's because I'm white and working in a predominantly black hospital. Maybe everyone just fucking hates me. I honestly don't know. Most people seem to enjoy working with me and seem to like me at work.\n\nThis is something I've dealt with my whole life. I've never felt included on plans (barring a small group of really close friends) and always feel like an outsider. I'm so fucking miserable and lonely. It's making it really hard to go to work because people sit around and talk about the last time they all went out. They all post pictures of shit I wasn't invited to on Facebook. They make plans right in front of my face and don't even bother to ask if I want to come out with them. \n\nI think I am going to ask my manager to switch me to night shift (although I am TERRIFIED of working nights) because they seem like the stronger team and they all seem closer outside of work compared to days and especially swing shift.

    "text": "Medication error(s) & termination Hi, I'm a pediatric nurse practitioner that recently started a new job at a school-based health center and I'm about 5 months into the job. The clinic that I \"took over\" from previous NPs was always missing basic things like gloves, white copy paper, and cabinets were filled to the brim with expired point-of-care tests (ie: rapid strep kits, ua/culture tubes), needles, medications, etc. I have been trying very hard to get this clinic back up to par, and made a full Excel sheet of inventory and expiration dates for all meds and lab supplies. \n\nThe other day I found that our \"private stock\" (non VFC or federally funded vaccines) had plenty of expired vaccines, so I pulled them out of the fridge and freezer(s) to be thrown away. The vaccine had been expired since 5/2016 and I started my position in 12/2016 (why the vaccine was still even there was beyond me). However, my medical assistant had inadvertently placed the expired MMR back into the freezer AND onto the VFC shelf. \n\nI didn't know this until I had jumped in to help with giving vaccines on a busy, under-staffed afternoon (it was just me and 1 MA that day) and gave the expired MMR vaccine to a patient because STUPID me didn't double check on the vials before drawing them up. Usually I re-verify all vaccines and write down lot #'s and exp dates, but since I had just done all the inventory just 4 hours earlier and knew there shouldn't be any more expired vaccines in the freezer, I didn't recheck. Which is still my own fault. \n\nNot only this mistake though, an incident report regarding vaccine errors has been filed 4 times in the past 5 months for my clinic. First I had ordered an extra flu shot on an 18-year old because I missed that he had already gotten the flu shot this season (I missed a page of his vaccine records). The second time, one of my medical assistants had given an incorrect vaccine because they went off a verbal order of mine but had grabbed a wrong vaccine and gave it WITHOUT looking at the order in the computer OR verifying the vaccine with me. The third time one of my newer medical assistants discovered she stuck herself with a needle after giving vaccines and had to go through the entire needlestick injury report/protocol. \n\nBut as the NP at the clinic, I feel responsible for all of the issues that has happened-- and I'm afraid that in the end, that is what my clinic manager and administrators will see too and fire me for all the cumulative errors. My clinic manager was supposed to have come in to do an in-service with our clinic after the 2nd vaccine error but it never happened because she \"got too busy\". In your experience, do you think I can be terminated (\"3 strikes you're out\")?",

    "text": "Moving from an RN in Aged Care to an RN in a Hospital. What do I need to brush up on? Hi, thank you to anyone who helps with this, you guys collectively have a lot of knowledge and are down to earth so I figured I'd put my question here.\n\nI started my new grad in aged care. I now want to work in a hospital for some experience. I originally wanted to work in a hospital but I didn't do so great in my new grad interviews (I was really insecure and I worked myself up so much about potentially not getting the job that I interviewed horribly). I feel way more confident now so I'm going to start applying for hospital jobs at the end of my aged care new grad program and see if I can land one.\n\nI don't mind aged care too much, I'm in Australia where it's 1:150 people with lots of assistant nurses and certificate IV nurses and enrolled nurses to help. It gets crazy stressful sometimes where I feel like my hair will turn white but most of the time it's not so bad. \n\nSo what I want to know is, what do I need to brush up on for hospitals? I don't remember anything to do with IVs but I'm sure I can learn, it wasn't that hard from what I remember.... and I think I'm gonna go to a course on IV cannulation, what do you guys think?\n\nAny feedback would help. I just don't know what I should be focusing on for hospitals as I have no hospital experience, except nursing school and I think aged care and hospitals are two different beasts!\n\nI have the following as stuff I've learned in aged care, I'm just gonna word vomit everything I can think of at the moment:\n\nClinical:\n- Catheters... so many catheters. Including trial to void, in and out etc...\n- PEG feeds.\n- Medication management.\n- Dementia specific nursing.\n- Palliative care.\n- Writing and implementing care plans.\n- Antibiotic stewardship.\n- Infections (MRSA/VRE/the usual)\n- Cytotoxic medication management.\n- s/c infusion pumps for palliation.\n- Skin integrity management.\n- Continence management.\n- Swallowing assessments (so many swallowing assessments).\n- Falls risk assessments.\n- Head to toe assessments including palpation because we don't have god-damn bladder scanners!\n- Wound management both complex (with vac dressing), chronic and acute.\n- Suicide prevention plans. Cornell scales for depression.\n\nInterpersonal/professional:\n- Conducting care conferences (?) with families eg about advanced care records or a complaint or something like that.\n- Conflict management.\n- Questioning a MO's order (this was scary!).\n- Developing and running education for other RNs and Assistant Nurses on delirium + catheters if that matters.\n- Direction and delegation of Assistant Nurses and Enrolled Nurses (diploma nurses) and Certificate IV Nurses.\n- Advocating for the residents (poor staffing levels = neglect and one other Certificate IV nurse and I managed to change this by putting in a formal complaint which = more staff. Some residents were being left soaked in urine!!)\n- Behaviour management +++.\n\nBonus:\n- Policy changes: s8 patches (morphine/fentanyl) were being cut in half by some nurses to achieve a dosage charted from the Dr. I worked with a few other RNs to change the policy so the doctors can't chart half patches... :|\n- The implementation of a communication board for people with aphasia/language barriers/dementia. We didn't have one lol so I just made one. Management loved it and it was a \"continuous improvement\" exercise...\n\nEducation:\n- Completing my honors in nursing at the moment. Focusing on leadership and clinical reasoning... (my honours degree is really airy-fairy actually...)\n\n**tl;dr: What differences are there between hospitals and aged care? What do I need to study before applying for work in a hospital?**",

    "text": "How does your company manage R&D/Prototype Projects? Hello fellow reddit engineers. I am a mechanical engineer with a couple years experience in industry working in design with two separate companies. I've done 3-4 large prototype projects with varying degrees of complexity and varying degrees of disorganization. I've found what works for me to manage projects and keep a team moving forward but I'm really curious how the rest of you keep your projects, large or small, organized and documented. Specifically I wondered;\n\n - Assuming you have a concept that you are relatively sure will work, do you run a prototype through your ERP/MRP system? Do you have a separate database for engineering projects or do you create part numbers, BOM, etc in the production instance?\n\n - If you work outside of the ERP/MRP system how do you maintain tracking, costing, BOM, and inventory? \n\n - When in the project do you attempt to capture your cost rollup? When does this consideration come into play for your design process?\n\nI know that there is no real black and white answer as it varies so much with the scope of the project. I'm just curious to everyone else's experience. Thanks so much for your ideas!\n\nTLDR; How do you manage your prototype projects so there isn't complete chaos but you still aren't bogged down in paperwork?",

    "text": "Even if I hadn't put in my notice, I would've left this week anyway. Holy shit, guys. My school is so bad. I'm at a Title 1 middle school. \n\nI've lost count of the number of times I've been assaulted this year. I've had students put hand sanitizer in my drinks, stab me with pencils, shoulder-check me, actually shove me, throw desks and chairs at me, throw backpacks at me, throw books at me, swing a piece of wood from a bookshelf at my head, threaten to hit me and bite me. \n\nI have students telling me to kill myself daily. I have students yelling that I'm a bitch in the middle of class, white bitch, witch, telling me to suck their dicks, that I must like getting cum in my eye, that I'm going to die alone and lonely, that I'm pathetic and everyone hates me. It's now escalated to students making explicit sexual comments and gestures at me on the regular. Students have threatened to tell their parents that I beat them and call the the n word in class, or that I've touched them inappropriately. \n\nMy admin's response has only ever been, \"Make sure you document everything.\"\n\nThere's been a couple weeks in October where I was breaking up multiple fights a day. In my classes, this has largely calmed down, but sometimes I'll cover for other classes and I have to grab a chair from a student before they throw it at another student. \n\nAdmin is criticizing me for not being able to control my classes. I can call security and they show up maybe half the time. If a student is removed from my class, they're back within 10 minutes and raising hell again. \n\nI've had outside observers come in from the city, who have *seen* me doing my best and doing everything by-the-book (in terms of instruction) and they've seen how the kids treat me and each other. That kind of validation is nice; that it's not my fault. Could I be a better teacher? Yeah. But there are teachers in this school who have been here 5, 10, 20 years and still having the same problems. \n\nAbout half of our kids are confirmed to be homeless, living in shelters or transient housing. Even with that, I was pleasantly surprised by how many parents showed up to conferences last week. Only two parents were the \"why are you so mean to my child, it's your fault that she's failing, you're a horrible teacher\" yada yada yada, but other teachers backed me up and confirmed that their kid is a jerk in their classes too.\n\nThe school has a roach problem, and I suspect a mice problem as well. There's lead in our pipes and water. There's mold in our bathrooms--the stench hits you like a wall when you walk in. \n\nI've lost weight. I'm losing my hair. I'm not sleeping and I'm rarely eating. I've called two suicide hotlines recently. \n\nI put in my two week's notice last week. \n\nI finally managed to see my former therapist (I \"graduated\" from therapy a few years ago). It took a while because she had the flu, no fault of her own. 20 minutes into our session, she said she's putting me on emergency medical leave and taking me out *immediately.* I only wish this happened sooner.\n\nThis job isn't worth it. \n\nThis isn't worth the paltry salary. \n\nThis isn't worth the disrespect. \n\nThis isn't worth the violence. \n\nThis isn't worth a 2 hour one-way commute. \n\nThis isn't worth the countless sleepless nights to get everything done. \n\nThis isn't worth my life. \n\nI worked so hard for this. I did great in uni and I came into this with passion and enthusiasm, and it's been literally beaten out of me. I was top of my classes, honors and excellent rec's from my mentor teacher and professors, and this was the only school that would hire me. I'm reluctant to continue teaching. Even if another school won't be this bad, I still don't think it's worth it. \n\nI don't know what my next steps will be. I've been applying to jobs in the private sector because I know I have awesome marketable skills, and I'd make a good employee. I'm hoping something will work out. In the meantime, I'm going to rest.",

    "text": "[PA] [11/12] - Having a terrible student teaching experience. Advice please **TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue. Now I'm facing two serious conversations with my school in less than a week span trying to find a resolution to move forward.**\n\nI am at a AA-sized school in western PA outside of the city. When I was first assigned to this school I was excited as the mentor teacher had received some awards and plaudits both statewide and even a national one. I thought \"what better person to learn from that this person\".\n\nWhen we first started it was going great. She was excellent at teaching me the ins and outs of contracts, etc (which I realize now was totally off-topic and shouldn't have even come up), the mechanics of school politics (again, some bells going off) and so forth.\n\nDuring the first week, I could see how she was a really good teacher. The kids respect her and she has great classroom management. On Tuesday of the first week, she said she would want me to start teaching the following week. So she would take the first Econ class of the day and I would teach the two in the afternoon. She wanted me to start drafting lesson plans for these days and then we'd go over them on Friday.\n\nThe first week of doing Econ in the afternoon went well, so she had me take over that class full time in Week 3, while I took over the second of her two Psych/Soc classes in the same format. In Week 4, it was all me for everything.\n\nWhile I was excited to jump into teaching full time, I should have had a few alarm bells going off:\n\n* why wasn't she modeling her preferred style of lesson planning to me?\n* why was she moving faster than my university's suggested timetable for giving me more responsibility?\n* how was I going to be expected to extrapolate from her incredibly abridged lesson plans?\n\nI took comfort in the fact that, at the beginning, she would sit down with me and go over what she would expect to me to cover the next week and so forth M-F. And it became our ritual, in a sense, for us to sort of broadly go over the next week on Friday and then for me to turn in an overview of the week by Sunday, which she would comment on if there were any concerns.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. She is busy on Friday with students asking about extracurricular stuff and my attempts to connect on the following week's material are rebuffed. So I do my best on Friday evening and Saturday to map out the week, extrapolating from a very thinly detailed syllabus to try to use as a pacing guide. I text her on Saturday evening asking if we could go over the plans for the week, and she responds \"I'm busy right now, I'll call you tomorrow at 5\". (bear in mind, she told me from day one that if I EVER need help to call and she'll \"talk me down from the ledge\" and work with me\".\n\nThe next day, I reach out by email ahead of time, sort of detailing all of my concerns about the upcoming week, my confusion over the pacing and wording in the syllabus and uncertainty as to her suggestions from the past. \n\nThen 5 comes and I get no response, then 7, then 9 - and by this point I'm freaking-the-fuck out. So I send another follow up text stating that I had sent an email with some questions and I was hoping to discuss the following day, at least, as well as the week moving forward.\n\nI get a text at 11:30 pm asking \"have you figured it out yet\". To which I of course responded no and that I thought i at least had a plan for the next day but that I really needed some clarification on the rest of the week. She responded \"**i can keep holding your hand forever, but you'll never learn anything that way. I need those lesson plans before 7 tomorrow. See you then**\n\nSo when she came in the door in the morning, I was hastily wrapping up the weekly overview lesson plan to be turned into the office - basically just going off of whatever she did last year.\n\nThen all week long, there was this tension in the classroom. I could feel it growing. I was frustrated with her for essentially abandoning me with little preparation (a strategy which many of my teacher friends derided as unprofessional and extremely unhelpful). She seemed annoyed with me for seemingly needing any help at this point.\n\nOn Wednesday, I get an email from the director of field placements at my university wanting to have a phone meeting the next day. On that phone meeting is literally everyone in the chain from the top of the school of education down to me. \n\nMy site director first allows me space to give my side, and then proceeds to list a rapsheet of complaints and errors on my part that have been privately communicated to her over the past week or two about my untimeliness in turning stuff in and unpreparedness for the day each day and needing to have my hand held for every little thing...yadda yadda.\n\nI was so taken aback and felt so cornered, but i swallowed my tears and the lump in my throat and did my best to give a fair account of everything from my end, to include - which I've yet to mention - that the previous week she broke her tooth in half and had 2 miss days of school in pain after getting it pulled and i was left with subs, etc. Then the following days she was in pain because she couldn't take her percocet before coming to school and so was always in a foul mood, but I did my best to steer clear, etc.\n\nThe school seemed understanding of my side, and said they aimed to support me in whatever way possible to help get me across the finish line.\n\nThen yesterday was teacher in-service. Teachers are supposed to be given an itinerary at least a week ahead of time. Our teachers were given them on Wednesday. My MT forwarded the email to me, but i notified her that as it was a Google doc, and she was not the creator, it wasn't able to be opened unless shared by the creator. She said she'd follow up, but never did.\n\nSo I arrive at 8 the on Friday morning, and go to meet her in the classroom, which is where we met previously. She's not there; door locked. I go to the auditorium, which is where in-service began last time, and no one is there. Finally I hear an announcement and see teachers walking toward the collaboration center, so I join them and we all walk in the door at 8. I get a text from her at 8:02 saying \"in-service started 2 minutes ago and you aren't here\". So i responded \"im here, in the back of the room\". She turns around and makes eye contact.\n\nLater in the day I get a call from my site director asking how the day is going, if I'm feeling any better after the ambush on the phone the day before, etc. Then she asks, what time did the in-service start this morning? I said, \"8\". \"And when did you arrive?\" \"just before 8\". \"Well, your mentor teacher sent me an email notifying me that you didn't arrive until 9\".\n\nI was PISSED. I forwarder her the texts proving that I was there at 8 and that I had notified my mentor teacher of my presence in the back of the room.\n\nI got ANOTHER call from the university and after some back and forth, they sort of seemed to agree with my suggestion that I felt that I was being sabotaged at this point for whatever reason. They said to not go into school on Monday, don't contact my mentor teacher, don't contact the school - they'll take care of it. What they want is to have a meeting where all the expectations of all parties are laid out in black and white, on paper, so there's no confusion, and then we'll figure out a path forward from there.\n\nI'm so frustrated and confused and exhausted and exasperated over the whole thing. I don't even know what to do going forward. I was told to not make any more lesson plans at this point and to just take the weekend to spend time with my kids and wife and think about some solutions to help get me across the finish line on December 8.\n\nI'm so furious I don't even know what to do. I'm also worried that my MT, if I remain in her classroom, is going to sabotage me by switching subjects this week to throw off any lesson planning I've already done (both classes are combined Psych/Soc and Gov/Econ) and we go back and forth. Everything I've planned for the rest of my time there is in Sociology and Gov, so I half expect to walk in the door tuesday and she'll have been teaching Psych and Econ and tell me to hurry up and make some lesson plans for the rest of the week.\n\nAnyway. Suggestions?\n\n**TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue.

    "text": "Did my school handle this wrong? Long post here. Yesterday as we were switching classes, there was an incident (which we all saw) in the hall involving another teacher. \n\nStudent A, let's call him Joe, calls student B who we'll call Chris, a stupid faggot. Chris walks up to Joe and says \"say that to my face one more time.\" So Joe looks him dead in the eye and says \"you're a stupid faggot.\" Chris jumps on Joe and the two start fighting. Their teacher runs over to Chris who she was closest to, and pulls him off, and he puts his hands up and walks away and says \"okay okay Mrs. T, I'm done fighting.\"\n\nSo now the teacher is standing in between both boys. Joe then jumps on her back and starts hitting her severely in the chest and neck. She manages to get him off and immediately sends both boys to the office, but she ended up with two pretty nasty bruises just below her neck.\n\nLater all 4 teachers get called to the office to give an account of what happened; we all saw it so the stories are the same. Principal takes a picture of the bruises for evidence and says the parents are on their way and she will let us know what happens. We're all thinking Joe will get kicked out for assaulting a teacher.\n\nLater we hear Chris is suspended for 5 days. Now we're just waiting to hear about Joe, and again we're thinking there's no way he'll be allowed to stay after attaching a teacher. Then we hear that Joe...is also suspended, but only for 3 days. The principal says it's because he has a behavior contract and he gets \"special exceptions.\" \n\nI know what a behavior contract is and how it works here. If the student breaks the contract, they're out. We had one kid break his contract when he got angry and called his teacher a \"white bastard\" and he was expelled about 10 minutes later. Another student was accepted at the beginning of the year, with such a bad history of schooling, and it was agreed between the parents and school that if he breaks even one school rule he's out. First day of school he walks in chewing gum and completely out of uniform, and was expelled that day.\n\nSo we have two students who were expelled for lesser incidents, and yet Joe only gets a 3 day suspension, less of a punishment than the other kid, for beating a teacher. All of us are just shocked, and upset that this student wasn't punished more severely. It's like the admin doesn't care about this teacher's safety. And this isn't even his first incident; he's been in so many fights with other students this year, fights that he started, that other kids are now afraid of him.\n\nTL,DR: student beat up a teacher and was allowed to stay with only a 3 day suspension, and got less of a punishment than the other student involved who stopped fighting, getting a 5 day suspension. All teachers are pissed.",

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Is the writing on the wall that I should look for a new job? Created a throwaway for this. The facts: I'm a senior marketing manager working in my dream job at my dream television network in NYC. (I realize how rare this is, and I am grateful every day.) I'm well-respected in my department, my reviews are really solid, and I'm given many opportunities to travel, work on high-priority accounts, do public speaking, etc.\n\nMy company has been very open and vocal over the last several months about a conscious initiative to hire more diverse candidates, both in our work force and in our talent on-air, which I happen to completely agree with. As a major media company, I think it's important that we represent all voices, and that people of all backgrounds can relate to what they see when they turn on our network.\n\nThe way my department is structured, there is no way for me to move up to the director level without one of the existing directors leaving - but there are about eight, so turnover does happen. About six months ago, there was an opening, which I applied for. I was told by the hiring VP that I was absolutely qualified and that I'd be an asset to the team, but they ended up hiring someone from outside the company, who happens to be of a minority ethnicity. (She's great, so I can't argue with the hire.)\n\nThat said, I now find myself in a pickle. They've basically said outright that any new hires will be diversity candidates, and I am a white woman. (Our offices are pretty 50/50 men and women, so being female doesn't count as diversity here.) I hate even considering that I might need to leave my dream job, but I also think the writing is on the wall that I most likely won't be able to move up because of this new initiative.\n\nWhat would you do if you were me?? Is it time to start looking elsewhere? I'm getting choked up just thinking about it, but I know I need to do what's best for my career. Thanks for any advice.",

    "text": "How can I get back on track after gendered career derailment? I'm a 28-year-old woman who has experienced gender-biased career derailment and am still recovering from it. In 2013-2014, I was employed as a Marketing Coordinator for a small executive training firm. The CEO postured himself as a champion of equality, but he was an elderly white man who had somewhat rigid views of women in the workplace. \n\nEven though admin tasks were not in my job description, there was immediately a lot of mission creep with me being expected to take an inordinate amount of extra work such as answering phones, running personal errands, and planning the company parties for no additional pay. My employer expected me to be an Office Manager and a Marketing Person and essentially work two jobs for the price of one (underpaid) employee. When I tried to advocate for fair treatment and compensation and presented evidence that they were incorrect in their management of me; the CEO became retaliatory and had me terminated for \"poor performance\" despite never having received a poor performance review and having performed the job for which I was hired competently and in good faith. \n\nMy direct manager tried to defend me and managed to have me retained as a work-from-home freelance contractor, but I took a significant pay cut and lost all of my benefits. Unsurprisingly, she was later also pushed out of the organization when she became pregnant but now works for another company and is one of my best clients. \n\nNow, I have a freelance practice and am much happier in my personal life. The money is okay, and I set my hours, but it can be unstable at times, and the lack of benefits and savings causes me a lot of stress-- not to mention the annual tax liability and overhead costs of running a small business. I wish I could find an in-house job where I am treated fairly based on the merits of my talents and work ethic, not my gender.",

    "text": "I have a CS degree with 5 years of experience in sales/advertising/marketing; should I get an MBA? Try to keep this to a minimum here...  \n\nFirst some more specifics:  \n- C.S. degree attained in 2012 (Cum Laude)  \n- Hate programming, found out too late in major, but like IT  \n- Good, solid leader with a proven track record in extracirriculars and job  \n- Currently under-utilized in my job  \n- Making ~$65k as a 1099-Misc pre-tax, ~$55k net; somewhat commission based  \n- Own house (mortgage)  \n- Can afford MBA without a significant blow to cash flow (will have over $20k in bank by start of Spring semester to pay for schooling)  \n- No retirement and no option for 401k match; IRA or self 401k are my only options  \n- GF who is in nursing school and will finish in 4 semesters, Spring 2019  \n\n\nMy current job situation is less than ideal. My job pays relatively well for my area and I like who I see on a daily basis, but I feel like something is missing. Also, I'm slightly disenchanted with having a wavering check once a month. One month I made $3,000, the next I made nearly $8,000. My job isn't hard but it is very taxing physically (i work in the elements) and I can't see myself doing this past 50 or so.  \n\nI really would like to transition to something that's a little more white collar based. My friend who is just now graduating (Winter 2017) with a double degree in finance and economics keeps telling me I should go back and try to get a job at the FDIC like he will. From what I've heard, the pay is pretty top notch as is the benefit package. I'd like to retire right on the dot at 65, and I feel like that's definitely doable with what I've heard at least from the FDIC gig.  \n\nI guess my main question is, what would I gain by getting an MBA? I think many hiring managers would look more closely at me when I apply for supervisory roles within a company. Also, I could possibly get something more geared towards business, like the FDIC job. In retrospect I should have majored in finance and economics like my friend but I don't think it behooves me to go back for another BA. I'd feel like I was taking a step back somehow.   \n\nAlso, I'm not sure if this helps or is something to consider, but everyone has this idea that all CS people are males who are exceptionally nerdy, but I'm not really like that. I can very easily talk to people and can present with incredible ease. As a matter of fact for my senior project we built an android app and my partner said we'd split the coding efforts 70/30 to him if I did all the presenting and everything along with it.  \n\nTL;DR - CS major dissatisfied hoping to make a career change into IT supervisory roles or business. Will an MBA help and is it worth it?  \n\nThanks in advance! Also I'm sorry if my formatting is poorly done. I'm relatively new to formatting on reddit.",

    "text": "Interior stylist or interior designer or interior architect? How to get a career in interior design. INTERIOR STYLIST OR INTERIOR DESIGNER OR INTERIOR ARCHITECT? \n\nThe definitions are a little loose and confusing. I myself was completely baffled by it all at the start, I knew what I wanted to do but had no idea how to define it which is essential when looking for your first dream job in the industry. Firstly, there is a big difference between interior decorators and interior designers/architects. To sum up the difference in one word, the difference is — Education. \n\nInterior Stylist – Photoshoots for editorials and advertising, trend forecasting, artistic/creative direction and show home styling.\nInterior Designer – Furniture specification, concept design, design management, design programmes and client management.\nInterior Architect (often found within an Architecture studio) – Room layouts, architectural detailing, a degree in Interior Architecture or Architecture, building regulations and planning applications.\nI personally define what I do as both interior design and styling. Even though I have a Bachelors Degree in Architecture, my passion is all about interior design. But I know for one thing, studying Architecture RIBA Part I at university was the best thing I ever did. It is respected in the design industry and gives you a professional chartered qualification that you can use anywhere, even if you decide to take a break from interior design for a couple of years.  The British Institute of Interior Design is a great tool for budding interior designers from specifying accredited universities to posting job advertisements.\n\nHOW DO I GET THE JOB?\n\nBuild your portfolio. This is YOUR selling tool, so make it look professional and slick. Try not to go ‘wacky’ with colour (my portfolio is a grey and white monochrome scheme), keep it clean and minimal so they are looking at your work not the graphic design. Leave as much white space as you can and take tips from graphic designers in the way they lay out pages (try to use Abode InDesign if possible).\n\nIf you can, try and get an internship. Internships, long or short, give you experience of the industry that you want to be in and allow you to find out if it is the right one for you. It means that you start from the bottom and you get access to amazing talent in the real world. And you can add the work to your portfolio to show to potential employers. You can find job advertisements everywhere but here are the best places to look.\n\nBritish Institute of Interior Design\nDezeen Jobs\nRIBA Appointments\n\nSHOW ME THE MONEY! HOW MUCH WILL I GET PAID?\n\nOf course, this depends on a lot of factors such as, education, prior work experience, size of the firm/company and location. A designer that is employed by a furniture company will most likely make less than a designer that is employed by a high-end architectural firm. Starting salaries for junior designers range from £18,000 to £23,000 a year. Experienced interior designers earn between £25,000 and £40,000. Senior designers can earn £45,000+, while creative/design directors can earn up to £75,000, and sometimes more. Salaries vary widely and depend on location and your reputation and contacts. It is possible to command high earnings, particularly when there’s involvement with high-profile ‘prestige’ projects.\n\nKeep in mind though, interior design is not all about plumping up cushions and selecting beautiful fabrics. You will be expected to work evenings and some weekends as your role will be integral to a large construction and development process, the client will always expect (almost) EVERYTHING for yesterday.\n\nMost of all, find a job in interior design that you love and you will never have to work a day in your life. This may take time but be patient. I know that if you are passionate and driven enough, you can achieve your dream. JUST GET OUT THERE AND START THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR FUTURE!",

Hey reddit, I heard you like thorough posts so get ready for this wall of text.\n\n**About Me:** I am 22, white, and female.

I make sure that I always keep up to that schedule. If I am at work at 9, I leave at 5, and if I am there at 10, I leave at 6. I don't have long lunches either.\n\nWhat surprises me is that all of my team members (5 other developers, including my manager), easily work 9-10 hours a day at least. My manager is online around 8 am each day, and at office around that, and I have seen email responses from him around 10 pm some days, including comments on pull requests which means he is working that late. Not only that, there is a developer on my team who let slip by one day that he was up till 3am the night before, like it was no big deal. What the hell?? Is that generally expected to be up working that long hours in a dev job?\n\nSome more details if it helps, all of the devs on my team are H1-visa holders (from India), I am the only white guy. I wish my team was more diverse, but it is what it is. I don't want to be singled out as the guy who doesn't work as hard just because I leave at 6. What do I do about the situation?",

    "text": "Should I report about racial stereotypes that go too far? Please i need advice? Hello cscareerquestions. Longtime lurker and finally made an account to complain about my possibly shitty situation. I just want readers to keep in mind and tell me in the end if I’m overreacting or am I actually being mistreated. I really want to believe I’m overreacting and I feel like I’m going crazy over this. \n\nTL:DR: I’m currently facing some less innocent stereotype jokes by an employee and I don’t know whether or not I should let it go or not.\n\nSo I work in an IT department that has a software team under a Canadian (Toronto area) company that does research. I am myself a young male Canadian-born Chinese who recently started my career as a software developer. Most of the stereotypes I’ve witnessed upon myself are very innocent and I play along and genuinely laugh. However, I have this one senior lead (who is White and from a commonwealth country other than Canada) and overall he’s a great guy and a great leader. He sometimes likes to use stereotypes a bit too much. A good amount of them time are innocent and I’ll play along or just not respond at all if they’re a bit more on the offensive (ex. Looking at a bunch of resumes and seeing a common last name like ‘Patel’ and saying hey that’s (another employee’s) brother)\n\nHowever, this one thing really got under my skin and prompted me to come here looking for advice. He wanted to know my “real” name and was being very persistent. I politely told him my parents gave me my western name first but it wasn’t enough for him. He even went to get other people to nag me about it who thankfully didn’t want to participate. He proceeded to try hard to annunciate his wife’s (who is also a Canadian born Chinese) and laughed. He’s a pescatarian who loves animals and loves to comment on a lot of the times when I’m eating something with meat and has also made some comments about me being a meat eater and being Asian. I feel like his wife just lets him have free reign on stereotypes but he should know not to have the same amicability to everyone else. That is probably what plays a huge part in his own mind that he can use Chinese stereotypes so frequently. My perception of him now makes me think he likes to make everything about my culture a joke and has somewhat of a superiority complex over i\n\nI really want to keep this job and has great benefits and a great pension and the other people I work with are just splendid. However, my contract ends in August with a chance to go on Full time with the benefits after that. My manager (who is also white) is a great teacher and mentor to me and the only thing he has ever asked me about my background is ‘What is your ethnicity’. My manager and I really get along and he knows I do a good job.\n\n However, I don’t know whether if I should make a complaint about this senior lead to my manager because what if he sees this as a nuisance to deal with a workplace problem that is related to racial sensitivity? The senior lead and manager are close professionally but not sure personally so I don’t know how to approach this. All I can think about is that if I make this complaint, am I going to be looked at as a problem? What if letting me go after my contract is the easier thing to do because I made this complaint? Does this also make me look bad if I’m trying to apply for another job and I say I complained about because of racial discrimination?\n\nSorry for the long post!",

    "text": "Analyst? Dev? Eng? What am I? **tl;dr**\n*trained in economics, started career in e-commerce, took a data science bootcamp, self taught python, done work related to data arch/infra, and dev/sys ops all in the course of 2 years.  not sure what my career path looks like to employers.*  \n\nLet's play a game.  I tell you what I do for a living and you tell me what my title is.  \n\nMy background is in E-Commerce and I went to school for Economics and Stats.  I've worked for my current employer, a small/medium-sized tech company, for a little over 2 years now where I was hired as a Data Analyst.  A few months before I started here, I finished a coding bootcamp course in Data Science where I started writing in Python.  When I started my current job, I expected to write some SQL, look at numbers, do some math, and tell people who made more money than me what to do about said math.  \n\nOver the first 3-6 months of my job, I took over the grunt work for a reporting engineering deptartment that was dissolved prior to a company re-org.  This included maintaining and optimizing **data ingestion, processing, and storage**; ingesting files from emails and data from APIs, parsing data with **Python and lots of Shell scripting**, and writing to **MySQL/Postgres** databases.  \n\nI inherited this system and for the first 3-6 months, the question I was usually asked was \"where is my data?\".  Over this time I made it a point to make sure no one had any reason to ask me that anymore.  \n\nMonths 6-12 included me flying abroad to develop a solution for a newly acquired startup in another country.  Their database was an Excel sheet, so I set out to build a similar infrastructure for them.  Excel was a key tool for them, so this included learning **VBA** to integrate their current workflow into the system I built, which this time leveraged **AWS** services, which my company had just begun using.  I set up **EC2, RDS instances, and made use of S3** - only using Python to handle dataflow.  \n\nMonths 12-18 was like going back to a marriage right after your first affair.  The processes I had established were pretty airtight and perhaps because the company was growing, there was less pivoting.  With less pivoting came less technical surprises.  It became maintenance from here until the next few months when I started getting back into analysis.  With no systems to worry about, I got to do some **statistical analysis** and a little bit of modeling.  Exploratory data analysis became a huge part of my focus.  With this, I became more involved in the process of displaying data.  Enter: **Flask, some PHP, and minimal Node.js**.  I built a few standalone apps with Flask, tweaked some legacy apps built in PHP, and contributed to some projects built in Node.  Through this I also became a bit more savvy with web servers.  Before this I had no idea things like **gunicorn or nginx** ever existed.\n\nSince then, there have been a few shakeups that have affected my role.  I've shifted back to infrastructure - primarily **monitoring and alerting**.  We tried a bunch of different monitoring platforms for setting up dashboards.  I leveraged the chat client our company uses to handle some alerting.  I also became more familiar with job scheduling platforms (basically fancy schmancy crons).  My department has grown but with more analysts, so occasionally someone will do something that crashes a server or clogs a database.  I've also became much closer to **MapReduce a la Spark and Hadoop**.  I learned more technical things about **EC2s, cluster management, and benchmarking** than I learned about Data Science in the bootcamp course I took.  I still enjoy white-boarding data architectures, so this week I'm **writing a Python library** that leverages some proprietary tech so that these new Analysts can stop being a risk to our infrastructure (half-joking).  \n\nSo here's my existential crisis.  What in the heck am I?  \n\nI went to school for Economics, and have no formal training in CS or IT.  I feel like I've gone in so many directions that I'm worried about landing another position if I decide to move to another company.  I understand that the REAL answer here is \"it's up to you\", but for the sake of an attempt to have a more precise career outlook, if you had to give it a name, what would you call my role during the last 2 years of my career?",

    "text": "Looking for a job (after being out of steady work since October 2016) Why is it so hard to get (and keep a job) these days in Seattle?  I primarily work contract roles because that's mostly whats out there.  Getting a fulltime position seems nearly impossible!  The last few companies that interviewed and/or considered me for full time positions flaked on me (even some of the contract hiring managers have been flaking also).  What is the big deal with this area lately?\n\nI'm an experienced SDET/HW engineer with 7+ years of industry experience.  My resume speaks for itself, I have worked at Microsoft on contract multiple times, have a diverse set of skills (not just one) and does great work, but ever since October, it's like the market has just... dried up.  What's the deal here?\n\nLately, Microsoft has been actively opening new positions for the Surface and Azure team.  I had two interviews for the Surface team.  The feedback was that for one I was not as qualified as the other candidate, while the other one didn't specify (likely because I was overqualified).  I'm not being picky about salary or anything, or even where I work, but the software engineering and IT industry has never been stable for me, and I've never had a full time position in my entire life because they are so hard to come by and much harder to get considered for.\n\nI post my resume on monster, careerbuilder, indeed, etc. and just started using LinkedIn, hired.com, and a few more.  No success at all.  The prior years before have been much more successful.  2016 hasn't been a good financial year for me, ant 2017 is just abysmal.\nNothing, nothing, NOTHING!\n\nI'm not trying to complain here, but I'm amazed that I haven't been kicked out of my place yet.  I don't have money to buy food, pay for transportation, and debt just keeps piling up (thanks alot, my idiot ex girlfriend), so I feel like it's do or die at this point.  I even thought of committing suicide several times.  There just has to be a way out of this, right?\n\nOne of my ultimate goals is to get back into Microsoft, specifically on the Surface team.  I've been on the Surface Hub team before, and did an outstanding job with tools development and automation but ever since the budget cuts in 2016, things have just been downhill from there.\n\nIf you want to know my skillsets, here's some of the languages and technologies I've used.\n- Visual C++, Visual C#, Java, Objective-C, some Javascript, some Python\n- .Net frameworks, open source APIs for Linux and MacOS\n- Cross platform native app development for iOS, Android, Win10 (UWP) and Blackberry 10\n- Automation using Selenium Webdriver, TAEF, Eclipse\n- Xbox testing and development\n\nAnd that's just a basic summary of the things I've used and excelled at, and yet I STILL can't find anything this year!  Once again, I'm not trying to complain but I really don't know what to do anymore.  6+ months of seemingly non-stop job searching with next to no results makes me want to quit software engineering and do something else that's going to provide SOME sort of stability because what's the use of getting paid an upper 5 figure or 6 figure wage if you just keep getting laid off all the time??  It really does just seem hopeless.  And lastly, I'm not trying to play the race card or anything (because I don't use the \"white man got me down\" excuse) but is it because I'm black?  No really, I'm running out of ideas.  My resume used to get me tons of interviews.  Now, not so much...\n\nAny ideas or insights would be really appreciated.\n\nShogun",

    "text": "Is this a good response to the question \"tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager\"? My response to this is the following story:\n\nThere was a time about a year into my career when I was working on a project to convert a data feed from a mainframe process to a SQL stored procedure. The feed was sending data from our systems to another area of the company, and receiving a feed back and storing the data. It was a monthly feed.\n\nWe worked closely with our business partners to analyze the requirements and develop the stored procedures. In one of the feeds there was some ETL logic required that neither my manager nor I really had a good understanding of. We reached out to some other folks in our department and found that another BA (business analyst), who was previously a developer, had some SQL code that did almost exactly what we needed, we only had to change a few data sources and outputs. From what I can remember his code was joining several data sources and using a cursor to output a temporary table to be used later in the feed. We worked with him to get this logic into our feed and to try and understand what it was doing.\n\nWhen it came down to it though, my manager and I did not have a 100% understanding of what Mike's (the BA) code was doing. We knew it would work, Mike knew it would work, but even after stepping through the code and working with Mike are understanding of this portion was still lacking. Mike is a bit a white-beard and we knew we could trust him and that the code was solid though. \n\nMy manager wanted to move forward with this portion of the feed being a \"black box\". I didn't really like the idea of doing that and voiced my opinion. However, since I was junior at the time I didn't really have much of a say in the matter. Even my manager's manager was OK with doing this. Especially since we were in a bit of a time crunch.\n\nIn order to mitigate as much risk as possible I made sure to test this code 200%. I wasn't happy that we were doing this, since it was going to be our name's at the top of the SQL script and we were owning it, but at the end of the day there wasn't much I could do.",

    "text": "Reflections on ACN versus MBB About me: spent over 4 years in ACN strategy after undergrad and was highly rated throughout.  Left just after being promoted to Manager for an MBA in the Chicago area.  Turned down the ACN return offer and took a full-time offer with an MBB.  I've now been at my MBB here over a year and am about to be promoted back to manager level.  Really happy with my decision overall.\n\ntldr: MBB is better than ACN.  That said, I enjoyed my time at ACN (couldn't be where I am without them, they gave me my first shot after all), still have a lot of friends there, and still think of my career counselor as a mentor.  But, if you want to do consulting, there's no reason why you wouldn't want to do it at MBB.\n\n**What's the same**\n\n- The day-to-day work:  The gist of what you do is pretty much the same.  Solve problems, build models, deal with people.  For example, I built a model recently that was pretty much a duplicate of a model I built back at ACN.  I put together a deck on change management that is very similar to what ACN does and the Partner loved it.\n \n- The travel: Yeah, it still sucks.  Still flying economy, still staying at a Westin, still renting from Avis.  Per diem's a little more generous, but then again, I don't get to keep what I don't spend, so it balances out.\n\n- The starting pay is pretty much the same\n\n**What's better**\n\n- The projects: MBB has clients that at ACN we could only dream about.  Where we have the same clients, the MBB projects are with more senior clients, the projects themselves are more interesting, and the stakes are higher (on average, obviously).  The mix of projects is also more skewed towards interesting things like strategy, deals, marketing, etc.  More than at ACN, what you're doing is meaningful for the company and there is something major at risk based on your recommendations.  Best of all, there's ZERO IT implementation projects that some Partner is trying to disguise as MC.  I remember so many people being pissed off when they got bait and switch'd... one of my best friends at ACN quit when a \"Product Strategy\" gig turned into managing the error resolution log for some shitty tablet.  Also, I never had bench issues at ACN, but know that a lot of people did - this isn't an issue at MBB.  Also, never have I felt like I was rubber stamping something.  Never have I had a partner push us to try to change numbers so he could go sell some other project.\n\n- Client relationships:  I feel like at ACN, we were mercenaries and hired guns.  For a lot of clients, we would come in, do some work, leave and have no idea when we would come back (on the Strategy side, obviously on the tech side it's different).  Even on the diamond clients.  MBB really feels like partners with the client.  In a weird parasitic way.  I guess because the clients are often higher up, but we've been working with some people for years and years on different topics.  We really have a pulse on what's going on in a company, the problems they're going to face, and because of that, there's a level of trust that I never saw at ACN.\n\n- Grunt work: there's just no comparison.  You can tell that MBB has been doing this for decades.  At ACN I spent hours and hours of my day doing research, trying to find free excerpts of research reports because the team was too cheap to buy them, Googling images of charts that hopefully appeared in a newspaper or something.  Now?  there's a whole team that does the research for me.  If I see a report I need, I can just buy it.  And don't get me started on comparing ACN's garbage fire of a KX.  Or slide creation.  At ACN I spent so much time making slides, tweaking slides, making them client ready.  QPT or whatever they call it now is shit.  At my firm now, I just draw stuff out, send it to the slide people, and beautiful slides the next morning.  It's incredible - hours and hours of my day freed up just from these two things.\n\n- The pay scale: it's a lot steeper at my MBB than it would have been at ACN.\n\n- Exit opportunities: I can't think of any of my ACN friends leaving to jobs where I'm like, \"damn, I wish I got that.\"  That happens weekly here.  \n\n**What's worse**\n\n- Hours: I probably worked 50 hours at ACN, now I work 60 hours.  I guess 10 more hours doesn't sound like much, but you really feel it.  Plus, it's always gogogogo... at ACN you could easily just take a break here and there - now I feel like there's just no downtime.\n\n- The competition: At ACN, I felt like I could put in 70% effort and still do really well.  Now, I feel like putting in 100% is just average.  On average, the people at MBB are just smarter, or work harder, or worse, both.\n\n- The 'kool-aid': At ACN, I never did any extracurics and it didn't make any difference - still got high ratings.  Now, I feel like I *have* to do stuff like help plan the holiday party or do white papers, etc.  It's not work, but it's still work.  It's time I rather use for something else.",

    "text": "New Year New Opportunity First, I want to say thank you to /r/consulting for the help and support over the last several months. The folks and wiki around here are incredibly helpful.  (Yes even you alcohol warriors)  This post will likely be my last from this account unless there are specific follow ups/questions/etc. so I'm a little more willing to be free with some info.\n\nI recently accepted an offer to join a Big4 digital strategy practice. I figured I'd put a little detail here as I'm a non-typical hire and perhaps someone down the line could utilize my experiences to some extent.  If this belongs in the regular recruiting thread, I'm more than happy to delete and move as necessary.\n\nSemi-pertinent details: US based, white male, mid 30s, former military, working in the healthcare industry, BA in Philosophy from not even close to target state school. 4.0 GPA and few extracurricular activities (but one of note).\n\nI was lucky enough to have a friend who recently moved into MBB from Big4, and had contacts at the Big4 I had in mind.  I scheduled a phone call with the senior manager and discussed my thoughts around moving to consulting, the whys and hows etc.  Said senior manager offered to internally refer me for any positions that came available for which I'd like to apply.\n\nI found several and applied for few as not to dump on a new contact I had little interaction with.  The SM talked to the recruiter for the position I eventually accepted and had the recruiter manually pull my application and pass it forward.  My initial app had been dinged by the electronic system, unbeknownst to me at the time.  This ding explains why this was the only position I received any follow up regarding, and I have still not heard for what reason I was initially dinged.\n\nI received a request for phone interview from the recruiter.  It was a pleasant 30 minute conversation detailing why I thought I would be a fit at the company,why I was looking to move, what I saw as my strengths, and general compensation expectations.  I was then scheduled for a phone interview with a manager similarly placed to my area of interest.  That interview was again about 25 minutes with a little over 5 minutes for me to ask questions.  This section of the process took about two weeks.\n\nI was then scheduled for face-to-face interviews in two weeks time.  During this time it was requested that I have another phone interview, this time with someone more healthcare focused.  I was told this interview went well and we proceeded with in person interviews.  \n\nThe interviews were specifically behavioral, tech, and case, though little of them fit what I expected out of said types of interviews. I was told that everyone had enjoyed speaking with me so far and the interviews were much more conversational that I expected them to be.  The case was very process focused \"what would you expect if X happened and how would you handle it\" kind of questions.\n\nI left without much feel for how they all went, though I'm a talker, so I figured my answers were sufficient.  I received a call back two days later wanting to move forward with the offer process.\n\nDue to the holidays and various levels of \"out of office\" for people involved, the offer process encompassed a few weeks with an expected start date around the end of January. I'll admit to the offer being slightly less than I was hoping for, but as someone stepping into a post-MBA role without an MBA or significant consulting experience, I felt it was a fair offer.\n\nFrom what semi-candid feedback I have been able to garner, my ability to speak concisely and effectively about a wide array of healthcare and business topics including the technologies at play and business processes along with a rather personable demeanor is what won the day.  It was commented that an interviewer had seen my name as someone who had looked at their profile, though I don't believe this was intended as a positive or negative statement, more an \"I saw this.\"  I did it to include in my conversations topics and questions relevant to their experiences and any shared experiences (typical interview prep, but I hear it was more important for a consulting interview as it illustrates the willingness to engage clients on their level).  Having an odd and noteworthy extracurricular gave some of the various interviewers throughout the process something to start with instead of diving head long into the meat of the resume.  \n\nI know a lot of this post will be old hat for many of you, but I figured there might be folks like me with some of the questions I had going through the process, and hopefully this quick run down of my experience illuminates one of the myriad of roads for making it into consulting.  Thanks again /r/consulting.\n\nEdit: clarity",

    "text": "Essay on Feminism I need ideas on what to write my essay about. It has to be 3-4 pages long and I have to have 2-4 references. I sort of wanted to discuss women on TV and use the TV series \"The Lost Kingdom\" on Netflix (Great series if anyone is looking for new shows to watch) to help analyze some of these issues.\n\n Just a few things:\n\n1. I think women should have free birth control\n\n2. I think \"inequality\" in regards to the amount of women who are CEO's is not actually an inequality. Women are now starting to become CEO's and a change in the amount of women who are managers/CEO's is not something that is going to change overnight/within a year.\n\n3. I think the pay gap between women and men is a skewed statistic because there are too many variables involved (Workplace wage, Actual position at company, How long you have been working.\n\n4. I'm a believer that the way women are percieved by the media (magazines, news, movies, music, etc..) is very innapropriate compared to how men are treated. I absolutely believe that women are sexualized way more than men. \n\n5. I think women and men should be required to sign up for the army draft. I believe that women and men should be required to take a physical/mental health test that may exclude them from the draft if they do not pass the requirements (Too emotional, height requirement, suffering from various mental health issues, etc...)\n\n6. I believe in white male privilege in US society but other privileges exist too. I believe in privilege in general. Wherever you are, you or someone else has privilege (whether it's privilege by being thin, privilege by skin color, privilege by being a native or immigrant, privilege with socio-economic status, etc..)\n\n7. I don't think Porn has anything to do with feminism \n\n8. I don't think that violence against women has anything to do with feminism. I think violence as a whole is a issue with society and that if you are violent towards any individual without legitimate reason (Ex: self defense (physical and verbal-bullying), standing your ground) then you should be punished.\n\n9. I think one of the primary issues with women's rights is also that many women expect things to be equal while also expecting men to do various things for them such as: \n\n              1. Make the first move\n              2. Pay for things\n              3. Be Chivalrous\n              4. Fix things that are broken\n              5. Propose for marriage\nOnce these stereotypes are addressed and resolved it'll help balance things more. \n\n10. I think that there should be a divide in women and men when playing sports. I think there should also be co-ed versions of the teams.  This is not a gender equality issue, this is a biological issue.\n\n11. I agree with the movement of loving your body (both men and women do this, but I see that it is primarily women who discuss this the most). I do not agree with the idea of loving your body and finding it acceptable/okay to live an unhealthy lifestyle though. If you are overweight, you should strive to be as healthy as possible, not use \"loving your body\" as an excuse to not be healthy. \n\nAny and all comments are appreciated. If you want me to explain further into detail any of my opinions let me know ^. If you disagree with any of my opinions and would like to debate/educate me more/change my view then feel free to comment too. If your emotional because my post triggered you in some way (sorry if it did, it was not meant to in any way) and just want to tell me that I'm a dickhead, please do so in a creative way. I'm a huge fan of creative insults. \n\nThanks for the help",

    "text": "Advice on salary Negotiation with an Indian Director I received an offer for around $54,000 for a procurement position with pretty good benefits (great medical) in SOCal. The director is from India with a couple years in the US and I am white. I feel he is trying to lowball me on a job offer.\n\nHowever, I have great experience with procurement and purchasing in a different field. The director has said he will have to train me on the new terminology so he would not pay me the $66,000 i asked for. \n\nThe interesting part is he was animated/rude about the negotiating process and that I was being sort of a pain for asking more. I am familiar with the software and processes his company uses so I feel the training I need is not a huge factor. The comparisons on salary sites for the industry/size of the company suggest I am well within the salary ranges.\n\nIs this a cultural thing should I push again for the $66,000?

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "Currently at my community school, many girls are opting to leave the nursing program to go to other nursing schools. (Huge fail rate, high nclex pass) Is this normal? Nurses at my hospital are telling me to transfer. Hi,\n\nI currently go to a community collage. I worked so hard to get into this nursing program. We had to be CNA certified, do a nursing interview with the director, have a 3.0 gpa, and pass an admission HESI with an overall 85%+ in Chemistry, Math, Reading, AP, and Biology.  \n\nI'm in my first semester of classes, and there are some red flags that are popping up. \n- Girls regularly crying in the halls.\n\n- Teachers tell us to ask if we have questions; when asked we get berated for \"not knowing our stuff\" and \"they won't be there to hold our hand.\"\n\n- They single out girls who work, and often embarrass them or are more harsh towards them. (During my nursing interview I was told to quit my job.)\n\n- During my nursing interview I was asked \"What are you willing to sacrifice for this?\" and I jokingly said \"my happiness and well being.\" and the director said \"Good, you are realistic\"\n\n- They pressure mothers to drop out, say they are going to have to neglect their children to stay in the program and asks if they can live with that.\n\n- We are not allowed to laugh or smile during labs, as \"Nursing is serious, not fun.\"\n\n- Student written up and has to attend weekly meetings with teacher and assistant director on \"attitude\" after she made A VERY VERY VERY mild joke to another student about 'critical thinking' when moving furniture around in lab to do a skill.\n\n- Action plans for student who come to class with seat belt wrinkles in scrubs. We have to line up and be inspected. Shoes have to pure white. Scrubs no wrinkles. \n\n- We are not allowed to have discussion (about material) in class or during breaks in between. \n\n- Signed contracts saying we have to study during breaks at school.\n\n- Mandatory tutoring sessions: 3 hours long, on a scheduled day. Side note: I took pharm early last semester and I asked for tutoring before it was mandated, they said they had no tutor available. \n\n- I received an 80% on HESI. I was told that they had to lower the bar for everyone, that I was going to fail the nursing courses due to my \"low score\", I was the third highest in my class. Highest being a 95%, Lowest 65%.\n\n- Only male student receives special attention. Gets called brilliant a lot, and dress code doesn't apply to him. He puts down other girls in class. \n\n- We self teach dose calc, I don't have a problem with this but we were expected to know this first day of class. Yet we were not told.\n\n-On average they accept 25 students, only 7 graduate. 90% nclex pass rate. \n\n- During nursing interview when asked about family, I was told to dump my boyfriend since he was a paramedic. \n\n- Paramedic and previous emt students belittled. \n\n- The staff proudly admits to weeding people out\n\n- Often compare nursing to doctors, openly admit to being harder then med school.\n\n- Wouldn't let me enroll into an additional course to get full time status for my grant.\n\n- We are not allow to ask about clinical sites, they said it sends red flags. I believe most girls do because we are located in the woods and most of us have to drive an hour or two just to get to school. So some ask for closer sites as to not drive in snow so early in the day. (non plowed roads.)\n\n- They take digs at confidence levels when ever they get a chance.\n\n- 2nd and 3rd semesters are leaving, warning first semester to get out while they can.\n\n- Teacher said we need to believe in god or else we won't make through nursing. (I swear I'm not taking this out of context.)\n\n- They are known for changing clinical sites the day before going.\n\n- Changed my whole class schedule a week before classes began,  I was told it shouldn't be an issue since I shouldn't be working anyways. (we are not allowed to sign up for our own classes which is common.)\n\n- Horror stories of girls being kicked out of clinical for odd reasoning. \n\n-  Nurses at hospital say to leave my collage as many them attended there and switched schools midway as it gets very catty between teachers and students. They felt happier at other schools, some claim they were learning more instead of being afraid to go to class.\n\nAt this point, I feel overwhelmed with all the negative emotion and reactions, especially from teachers. I'm afraid to ask questions. I don't mind course work. I have to figure out how to starch my scrubs now and its difficult to hide that I work night shift on a med surg unit. (There are only two hospitals in the region that people can work at/clinical).\n\nSeeking advice. Is this normal? I want to learn and ask questions but don't feel like I can.",

    "text": "[PA] [11/12] - Having a terrible student teaching experience. Advice please **TL;DR: Cooperating/Mentor Teacher seemed good/great at first. Flipped some sort of switch in her head last week and decided to seemingly sabotage my experience. Wrote tons of complaints about me behind my back to my university but never communicated with me that there was an issue. Now I'm facing two serious conversations with my school in less than a week span trying to find a resolution to move forward.**\n\nI am at a AA-sized school in western PA outside of the city. When I was first assigned to this school I was excited as the mentor teacher had received some awards and plaudits both statewide and even a national one. I thought \"what better person to learn from that this person\".\n\nWhen we first started it was going great. She was excellent at teaching me the ins and outs of contracts, etc (which I realize now was totally off-topic and shouldn't have even come up), the mechanics of school politics (again, some bells going off) and so forth.\n\nDuring the first week, I could see how she was a really good teacher. The kids respect her and she has great classroom management. On Tuesday of the first week, she said she would want me to start teaching the following week. So she would take the first Econ class of the day and I would teach the two in the afternoon. She wanted me to start drafting lesson plans for these days and then we'd go over them on Friday.\n\nThe first week of doing Econ in the afternoon went well, so she had me take over that class full time in Week 3, while I took over the second of her two Psych/Soc classes in the same format. In Week 4, it was all me for everything.\n\nWhile I was excited to jump into teaching full time, I should have had a few alarm bells going off:\n\n* why wasn't she modeling her preferred style of lesson planning to me?\n* why was she moving faster than my university's suggested timetable for giving me more responsibility?\n* how was I going to be expected to extrapolate from her incredibly abridged lesson plans?\n\nI took comfort in the fact that, at the beginning, she would sit down with me and go over what she would expect to me to cover the next week and so forth M-F. And it became our ritual, in a sense, for us to sort of broadly go over the next week on Friday and then for me to turn in an overview of the week by Sunday, which she would comment on if there were any concerns.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. She is busy on Friday with students asking about extracurricular stuff and my attempts to connect on the following week's material are rebuffed. So I do my best on Friday evening and Saturday to map out the week, extrapolating from a very thinly detailed syllabus to try to use as a pacing guide. I text her on Saturday evening asking if we could go over the plans for the week, and she responds \"I'm busy right now, I'll call you tomorrow at 5\". (bear in mind, she told me from day one that if I EVER need help to call and she'll \"talk me down from the ledge\" and work with me\".\n\nThe next day, I reach out by email ahead of time, sort of detailing all of my concerns about the upcoming week, my confusion over the pacing and wording in the syllabus and uncertainty as to her suggestions from the past. \n\nThen 5 comes and I get no response, then 7, then 9 - and by this point I'm freaking-the-fuck out. So I send another follow up text stating that I had sent an email with some questions and I was hoping to discuss the following day, at least, as well as the week moving forward.\n\nI get a text at 11:30 pm asking \"have you figured it out yet\". To which I of course responded no and that I thought i at least had a plan for the next day but that I really needed some clarification on the rest of the week. She responded \"**i can keep holding your hand forever, but you'll never learn anything that way. I need those lesson plans before 7 tomorrow. See you then**\n\nSo when she came in the door in the morning, I was hastily wrapping up the weekly overview lesson plan to be turned into the office - basically just going off of whatever she did last year.\n\nThen all week long, there was this tension in the classroom. I could feel it growing. I was frustrated with her for essentially abandoning me with little preparation (a strategy which many of my teacher friends derided as unprofessional and extremely unhelpful). She seemed annoyed with me for seemingly needing any help at this point.\n\nOn Wednesday, I get an email from the director of field placements at my university wanting to have a phone meeting the next day. On that phone meeting is literally everyone in the chain from the top of the school of education down to me. \n\nMy site director first allows me space to give my side, and then proceeds to list a rapsheet of complaints and errors on my part that have been privately communicated to her over the past week or two about my untimeliness in turning stuff in and unpreparedness for the day each day and needing to have my hand held for every little thing...yadda yadda.\n\nI was so taken aback and felt so cornered, but i swallowed my tears and the lump in my throat and did my best to give a fair account of everything from my end, to include - which I've yet to mention - that the previous week she broke her tooth in half and had 2 miss days of school in pain after getting it pulled and i was left with subs, etc. Then the following days she was in pain because she couldn't take her percocet before coming to school and so was always in a foul mood, but I did my best to steer clear, etc.\n\nThe school seemed understanding of my side, and said they aimed to support me in whatever way possible to help get me across the finish line.\n\nThen yesterday was teacher in-service. Teachers are supposed to be given an itinerary at least a week ahead of time. Our teachers were given them on Wednesday. My MT forwarded the email to me, but i notified her that as it was a Google doc, and she was not the creator, it wasn't able to be opened unless shared by the creator. She said she'd follow up, but never did.\n\nSo I arrive at 8 the on Friday morning, and go to meet her in the classroom, which is where we met previously. She's not there; door locked. I go to the auditorium, which is where in-service began last time, and no one is there. Finally I hear an announcement and see teachers walking toward the collaboration center, so I join them and we all walk in the door at 8. I get a text from her at 8:02 saying \"in-service started 2 minutes ago and you aren't here\". So i responded \"im here, in the back of the room\". She turns around and makes eye contact.\n\nLater in the day I get a call from my site director asking how the day is going, if I'm feeling any better after the ambush on the phone the day before, etc. Then she asks, what time did the in-service start this morning? I said, \"8\". \"And when did you arrive?\" \"just before 8\". \"Well, your mentor teacher sent me an email notifying me that you didn't arrive until 9\".\n\nI was PISSED. I forwarder her the texts proving that I was there at 8 and that I had notified my mentor teacher of my presence in the back of the room.\n\nI got ANOTHER call from the university and after some back and forth, they sort of seemed to agree with my suggestion that I felt that I was being sabotaged at this point for whatever reason. They said to not go into school on Monday, don't contact my mentor teacher, don't contact the school - they'll take care of it. What they want is to have a meeting where all the expectations of all parties are laid out in black and white, on paper, so there's no confusion, and then we'll figure out a path forward from there.\n\nI'm so frustrated and confused and exhausted and exasperated over the whole thing. I don't even know what to do going forward. I was told to not make any more lesson plans at this point and to just take the weekend to spend time with my kids and wife and think about some solutions to help get me across the finish line on December 8.\n\nI'm so furious I don't even know what to do. I'm also worried that my MT, if I remain in her classroom, is going to sabotage me by switching subjects this week to throw off any lesson planning I've already done (both classes are combined Psych/Soc and Gov/Econ) and we go back and forth. Everything I've planned for the rest of my time there is in Sociology and Gov, so I half expect to walk in the door tuesday and she'll have been teaching Psych and Econ and tell me to hurry up and make some lesson plans for the rest of the week.\n\nAnyway.

    "text": "Is the writing on the wall that I should look for a new job? Created a throwaway for this. The facts: I'm a senior marketing manager working in my dream job at my dream television network in NYC. (I realize how rare this is, and I am grateful every day.) I'm well-respected in my department, my reviews are really solid, and I'm given many opportunities to travel, work on high-priority accounts, do public speaking, etc.\n\nMy company has been very open and vocal over the last several months about a conscious initiative to hire more diverse candidates, both in our work force and in our talent on-air, which I happen to completely agree with. As a major media company, I think it's important that we represent all voices, and that people of all backgrounds can relate to what they see when they turn on our network.\n\nThe way my department is structured, there is no way for me to move up to the director level without one of the existing directors leaving - but there are about eight, so turnover does happen. About six months ago, there was an opening, which I applied for. I was told by the hiring VP that I was absolutely qualified and that I'd be an asset to the team, but they ended up hiring someone from outside the company, who happens to be of a minority ethnicity. (She's great, so I can't argue with the hire.)\n\nThat said, I now find myself in a pickle. They've basically said outright that any new hires will be diversity candidates, and I am a white woman. (Our offices are pretty 50/50 men and women, so being female doesn't count as diversity here.) I hate even considering that I might need to leave my dream job, but I also think the writing is on the wall that I most likely won't be able to move up because of this new initiative.\n\nWhat would you do if you were me?? Is it time to start looking elsewhere? I'm getting choked up just thinking about it, but I know I need to do what's best for my career. Thanks for any advice.",

    "text": "Interior stylist or interior designer or interior architect? How to get a career in interior design. INTERIOR STYLIST OR INTERIOR DESIGNER OR INTERIOR ARCHITECT? \n\nThe definitions are a little loose and confusing. I myself was completely baffled by it all at the start, I knew what I wanted to do but had no idea how to define it which is essential when looking for your first dream job in the industry. Firstly, there is a big difference between interior decorators and interior designers/architects. To sum up the difference in one word, the difference is — Education. \n\nInterior Stylist – Photoshoots for editorials and advertising, trend forecasting, artistic/creative direction and show home styling.\nInterior Designer – Furniture specification, concept design, design management, design programmes and client management.\nInterior Architect (often found within an Architecture studio) – Room layouts, architectural detailing, a degree in Interior Architecture or Architecture, building regulations and planning applications.\nI personally define what I do as both interior design and styling. Even though I have a Bachelors Degree in Architecture, my passion is all about interior design. But I know for one thing, studying Architecture RIBA Part I at university was the best thing I ever did. It is respected in the design industry and gives you a professional chartered qualification that you can use anywhere, even if you decide to take a break from interior design for a couple of years.  The British Institute of Interior Design is a great tool for budding interior designers from specifying accredited universities to posting job advertisements.\n\nHOW DO I GET THE JOB?\n\nBuild your portfolio. This is YOUR selling tool, so make it look professional and slick. Try not to go ‘wacky’ with colour (my portfolio is a grey and white monochrome scheme), keep it clean and minimal so they are looking at your work not the graphic design. Leave as much white space as you can and take tips from graphic designers in the way they lay out pages (try to use Abode InDesign if possible).\n\nIf you can, try and get an internship. Internships, long or short, give you experience of the industry that you want to be in and allow you to find out if it is the right one for you. It means that you start from the bottom and you get access to amazing talent in the real world. And you can add the work to your portfolio to show to potential employers. You can find job advertisements everywhere but here are the best places to look.\n\nBritish Institute of Interior Design\nDezeen Jobs\nRIBA Appointments\n\nSHOW ME THE MONEY! HOW MUCH WILL I GET PAID?\n\nOf course, this depends on a lot of factors such as, education, prior work experience, size of the firm/company and location. A designer that is employed by a furniture company will most likely make less than a designer that is employed by a high-end architectural firm. Starting salaries for junior designers range from £18,000 to £23,000 a year. Experienced interior designers earn between £25,000 and £40,000. Senior designers can earn £45,000+, while creative/design directors can earn up to £75,000, and sometimes more. Salaries vary widely and depend on location and your reputation and contacts. It is possible to command high earnings, particularly when there’s involvement with high-profile ‘prestige’ projects.\n\nKeep in mind though, interior design is not all about plumping up cushions and selecting beautiful fabrics. You will be expected to work evenings and some weekends as your role will be integral to a large construction and development process, the client will always expect (almost) EVERYTHING for yesterday.\n\nMost of all, find a job in interior design that you love and you will never have to work a day in your life. This may take time but be patient. I know that if you are passionate and driven enough, you can achieve your dream. JUST GET OUT THERE AND START THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR FUTURE!",

    "text": "MMPA (Masters in Management & Professional Accounting) program at University of Toronto Mississauga plagued by a culture of secrecy Due to a minor conflict with the secretary, the MMPA program sent to the Big Firms via their secret personality profile that I had a communication problem (without asking my side of the story). I was criticized for attending few social functions as I had a parent with dementia (they of course, never asked me, but they assumed I was being unsociable without asking me).   As such, despite a prior Masters degree and a recipient of numerous scholarships, I was not interviewed by any large or mid-sized firm - confirmed by partner of firm I worked at.\n\nHis use of a personality profile without the adequate understanding of psychology highlights his overconfidence in his decisions and incompetence.  The use of a director's list for student he personally think will excel lacks objective criteria leading him wide open to biased decision making.  Not surprisingly, many white males make the list.  \n\nI approached the director of the program at the time, Leonard J Brooks about my profile issue per the firm Partner but he denied everything but then offered help to find suitable employment. He tried covering everything up and denied everything. Not very ethical, is it?\n\nAfter 3 years, he changed his story to, \"I haven't put enough effort to find work.\" This is deeply unfounded as I applied to positions and worked with a career counselor. The disturbing part is lying (unethical for an ethics prof), and not taking ownership for his co-directors mistake about my \"communications problem\" by using deflection.\n\nSo, MMPA assigned my friend to golf with a small firm representative, despite her A grades. Our Organizational Behaviour prof in the program verified existence of the confidential personality profile and criticized their overconfidence and lack of psychology training to be able to accurately construct this (these are accountants).  Thankfully, Leonard Brooks has moved on to semi-retirement as this situation highlights questions about his competence.  He was over 80 years old.\n\nRegarding the situation, the concern of Len Brooks lack of transparency, lying, and over use of power (eg not responding to emails; deflecting the situation to make it all my fault) He is the ideal example of a person who at the top has forgotten to listen to those below. My recommendation for him, based on our teachings in Organizational Behaviour, read the Harvard Negotiation Project for effective open leadership styles.\n\nMany negative posts I wrote to tell my story, Len Brooks had removed.  His attempts to quell freedom of speech is simply not ethical.  We must strive to be open and transparent.  This is the ethical way and is in-line with current research in OB.  Yet, Brooks lack of professional qualifications (no PhD) highlights his knowledge gap.",

Minus the unfortunate normalcy of backstabbing coworkers and a shady boss, I have been sexually and verbally harassed on a consistent basis. The last incident was when a cook cursed me out (which he's done several times to just about all of us managers). I was left shaking. He is very tall and larger than me. Gets in my face and is physically threatening. This isn't the first time. But his immediate boss and my director have refused to fire him.

I know for a fact that neither my district or Regional manager care much about how we are treated. As long as the client is happy.

I would like to leave in good standing but I feel as though with so many white, powerful men above me, they could easily paint me out to be the problem.

The fact that males who've completed military service get networking/career opportunities that are not afforded to females.\n\nLet me reiterate that: the feminists are angry that females dont get the benefits of being forced into military conscription, but have zero issues with the female lack of obligation of being forced into conscription. \n\nYa gotta love these terrorists....\n\n\n\n.....anyone else think of other bullet points to add? \n\n----\n\n**EDIT: just to add on about the 'workplace injury/fatality' part:\nwhen was the last time a feminist advocated equalizing the gender ratio of blue collar jobs: the dirty/dangerous/unhealthy/isolated jobs that are dominated by men? \n\nwhen was teh last time a feminist talked about equalizating coal miner jobs, or garbage truck collectors, or bus/taxi drivers, or construction workers?

Taking this approach, while ignoring the larger \npicture of DV and IPV, disadvantages not just men who are victims of \nDV/IPV but women who are victims of DV/IPV as well.\n\nReciprocal IPV involves intimate partner violence in which each person \nin the relationship is both a perpetrator and victim of IPV.  The \nPartner Abuse State of Knowledge (PASK) Project, the largest \nmeta-analysis of DV/IPV research ever undertaken, shows that more than \nhalf of all IPV is reciprocal.[1]\n\nThe Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study found high \nrates of reciprocal IPV among study participants.  The document \n\"Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary \nHealth and Development Study\" released by the US National Institute of \nJustice found:\n\n\"When the data were analyzed, victimized women were 10 times more likely \nto be perpetrators than other women and male perpetrators also were 19 \ntimes more likely to be victims than other men.\"[2]\n\nThe National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health also found that \nabout half of all IPV is reciprocal IPV.  The study examined differences \nin injury rates between reciprocal and non-reciprocal IPV and found that \ninjury rates are higher in reciprocal IPV than non-reciprocal IPV.[3]\n\nOne of the key indicators of whether a woman will be a victim of IPV is \nwhether she is a perpetrator of IPV.[3] It follows then that one \nimportant way that a woman can avoid being a victim of IPV is to not be \na perpetrator of IPV.  Research by Capaldi has found that this holds \ntrue.[4]\n\nModels that ignore reciprocal IPV can inhibit violent women from \nreceiving the support they need to stop their violence.[5]\n\nWhite Ribbon Australia completely ignores reciprocal IPV as it advances \na gendered narrative. By ignoring the prevalence of reciprocal IPV White \nRibbon Australia is preventing effective interventions as its approach \ndiscounts the need to intervene with violent women. This will contribute \nto the continuation of reciprocal IPV and actually make it more likely \nthat the women involved will be injured. By ignoring reciprocal IPV \nWhite Ribbon Australia is contributing to violence against women.\n\nThe evidence overwhelmingly shows that the approach taken by White \nRibbon Australia is fundamentally flawed.  I encourage White Ribbon \nAustralia to respond, explaining whether the organisation intends to \naddress the shortcomings in its approach to IPV and if so, how.\n\nPlease note that this is an open letter and will be published in various \nlocations online.  In the interests of transparency we strongly \nencourage White Ribbon Australia to publish a response.  From time to \ntime we will report to our readers as to whether a private response has \nbeen received or a public response published.\n\n                 Robert Brockway\n                 President\n                 Australian Men's Rights Association Inc.\n\n[1] PASK \"Partner Abuse State of Knowledge\" project, the largest \nmeta-analysis of DV/IPV research ever undertaken. \nhttp://www.domesticviolenceresearch.org\n\n[2] \"Findings About Partner Violence From the Dunedin Multidisciplinary \nHealth and Development Study\" http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/170018.pdf\n\n[3] \"Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between \nRelationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner \nViolence\" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1854883/\n\n[4] \"Researcher Says Women's Initiation of Domestic Violence Predicts \nRisk to Women\", discussing the work of Dr Deborah Capaldi. \nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/glenn-sacks/researcher-says-womens-in_b_222746.html\n\n[5] \"Domestic violence is most commonly reciprocal\" \nhttp://pb.rcpsych.org/content/35/1/33.1",

    "text": "How to deal with catcalling-it's made me a reactive hot mess Twoxchromosomes, I need some advice on how to deal with catcalling? I know some women like it, and having spent time in countries where machismo culture is very strong I didn't feel endangered or nearly as angry in those cultures. I don't judge the women who feel sexy because of it.  But for me, I can't help but feel ashamed, righteous, humiliated and angry when it happens in my home city. Catcalling happens to me several times a day, no surprise here in New York.\n\n I'll go out of my way to avoid construction sites if there's one up ahead or if there's a group of men hanging out on the block. I try to dress so that I don't attract attention, and god help me when summer time shorts become necessary. I wish I could wear less covered clothing but every time I do I get way more attention and I regret my wardrobe choices. If I can \"feel\" a man's eyes on me as I pass by I can't help feeling disgusted, especially if he sticks his head in my path to leer at me as I pass. Some days I hate my face and body for attracting men, which duh isn't healthy. Among the most horrifying memories have been being followed down the street in the dark, cornered by groups of white men speaking to me in Mandarin (which isn't even a dialect I understand), Konichiwa-ed, grabbed on the ass, and jacked off to pants on and pants off. One time I gave some change to a guy and he had a blanket, I didn't realize he was jacking off as I spoke to him for a minute until he broke off mid-sentence saying \"UHN, I'm gonna come!\"\n\nIn part, I am angry because 3/4 of the time the comment I receive is about me being Asian, which I don't identify with as strongly because I'm a native New Yorker--not here to fill your passive Asian sex doll fantasy because I know just about as much as you do about China. Today, I lost control and I crossed a line for myself.\n\nA man was on his electric bike and whispered behind my ear, \"Hey pretty. Wanna come to bed sexy?\" Which I'm sad to say I don't consider that bad. But I reacted without thinking- turned around and shoved his bike down. He didn't even fall off, just put a foot down to catch himself and I lost my cool. Started yelling to him about how women don't like to be treated like objects. And he said, \"Don't take it so personally. YOU don't like it. YOU. You shouldn't be out here pushing people on the street.\" And then another guy came to his rescue and was like, \"calm down Mami, calm down\" (to further my outrage) and grabbed me by the shoulders and pushed me away from bike man. I walked away.\n\nUgh, what should I do? I've crossed my own threshold here--My reaction was rash and violent, and when I get catcalled I frequently replay violent scenes in my head of what I could have done instead of just walking away and ignoring them. I don't normally spend time thinking about the attention I get from men, and my anger usually subsides pretty quickly. But today was a game changer--I reacted with the intention of violence, and even though he wasn't hurt it's clear this whole catcalling situation is clearly messing with my thoughts and behavior. If you also hate catcalling, how do you deal?\n\nTLDR; sick of getting catcalled to the point where it's fucking with me big time and I don't want to think or act violently, advice?",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "Judge: Suspensions OK For Albany High Students Who ‘Liked’ Racist Posts https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/judge-suspensions-ok-albany-high-students-racist-posts/\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An East Bay school district acted properly when it suspended five students who “liked” or commented on racist images on another student’s Instagram account that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach and comparisons of African-American women and students to gorillas, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe case raised thorny questions about how strictly schools can regulate student speech and whether “likes” on social media should be treated similarly to the original posts.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato said in his decision late Wednesday the five students contributed to disruption at Albany High School in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe judge rejected arguments that the Albany Unified School District violated the students’ free speech rights because the offensive posts were on a private account and made off campus.\n\nDonato said the accounts’ followers were mainly Albany High School students. The posts pictured students and school employees and created a risk of substantial disruption at the school, the judge said.\n\n“These cases establish that students have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence,” he said. “They have an equivalent right to enjoy an education in a civil, secure, and safe school environment.”\n\nAn attorney for three of the students had no immediate comment. An attorney for the other two, Darryl Yorkey, said “liking” images does not necessarily express approval.\n\n“I think the judge took an opinion that many of us do in the older generations in assuming that a ‘like’ on its face is just that, ‘I like it, I approve of it,'” he said.\n\nHe said many of the students who were suspended over the images were Asian and were just trying to shock each other.\n\n“Taken out of that context, it definitely looks really bad,” he said. He did not immediately know whether his clients would appeal Donato’s ruling.\n\nA phone message left with the school district seeking comment on the ruling was not immediately returned.\n\nA male student identified in court documents only as “C.E.” created the account in November 2016 and posted on it over the next several months.\n\nOne post showed a screenshot of a female African American student that she had captioned, “I wanna go back to the old way.”\n\nC.E. juxtaposed an image on the student’s post of a white man beating a black slave hung by his hands, according to Donato’s ruling.\n\nSchool officials learned about the account in March. They called in mental health counselors to help calm students and contacted police over concerns references to lynching, nooses and the Ku Klux Klan in the posts could constitute threats of violence, Donato said.\n\nC.E. was suspended and later expelled. Donato upheld his discipline as well on Wednesday.\n\nBut the judge said the district went too far when it disciplined two other students. One followed the account but appeared to have done nothing else and the other commented that the account was “racism solely directed at black people” with an emoji of a laughing face, the judge said.\n\nThe judge overturned their suspensions.",

    "text": "Dating question (possibly controversial) Throwaway because I know it's a bad attitude to have and the post may seem inflammatory, but I can't talk about this to my girl friends and I wonder if it's ever happened/currently happens to other black ladies.\n\n\nDo you or did you in the past refuse to date black men as a knee-jerk reaction to them taking us for granted, especially if we're dark skinned? Growing up, I was made fun of, ignored or overlooked by my fellow black classmates and the only boys who had anything nice to say about me were either mixed with a black mom or born of mixed parents themselves or not black at all.\n\n\nIn college, black guys finally seemed interested but only because they had noticed men of other races being interested in me. Some good black male friends of mine acknowledged that this was true, too. I didn't like that at all, it felt like I was only good if I was vetted by other races of men. Deep down, they weren't really attracted to me, they still thought I was inferior for being darkskinned and black (the same rules didn't apply to dark Indian or South East Asian women of course) but thought that surely, I couldn't be this ugly if I was popular with men of \"better\" races (according to them). Combined with seeing everywhere black men worshipping non black women (or playing the \"I have no preference\" card when literally every other race of men prefers their own) in general in the media as well as in my life, I immediately judge any black guy who shows interest in me and know from the beginning I won't date them. I feel like I'm \"sloppy seconds\" and the second a(nother) non-black (or mixed/light skinned) woman comes along, I'm gonna be dumped like hot coffee. It overrides their looks and personality, however pleasing they may be.\n\n\nI also don't want to reinforce their notion that dark black women will always be there and that they can always fall back on us and be welcomed with open arms, no matter how dismissive they've been on us beforehand.\n\n\nNow, I know that it's somewhat unfair to paint all black guys with such a brush. That's why I'm posting. I don't have problems with dating at all otherwise, but I know such thinking is problematic and wonder if other women have been in similar situations.",

    "text": "Born and raised As-Am but I refuse to be ashamed of who I am. I'm Chinese - and China has been stereotyped as the world's sweatshop, people with weird eyes, dog eaters and other undesirable things. I also grew up an Asian American, who didn't see race until late high school, but before I could fully understand it, I went back home to China. \n\nMy mom used to microwave vegetable buns she bought from Chinatown for my lunch and I used to bring all sorts of Chinese food for lunch. It got to a point where even other Asians in class started blaming me whenever they smelled something funky. I never once assumed that the way I looked or the food I ate was weird because that's who I was, though luckily for me, nobody made a big deal out of it because I grew up in a diverse neighborhood.\n\nBut as I grew older and traveled beyond my racially diverse, lower-middle class coastal American city, I've noticed that I've slowly become the \"other\" in society. I've begun slight changes in the way people approached me, a certain coldness or strangers acting weirdly confident around me because they assumed or knew I wasn't a local.\n\nWell, I now live in China and I'm past the age where anger was my response to the world. I've accepted that this is the way things are, and all I can say is - it's made things a lot easier for me. I'm a Chinese person who speaks great English and that's who I am - no more dwelling on what my cultural identity is or how I should change who I am just so I can fit in with everyone else. I don't have to be sorry for being Chinese abroad or the fact that I speak great English in China, and I do feel sorry for anyone who doesn't agree. What's there to lose? They'll judge you anyway, do as you wish.\n\nEven though I live in China now, I am still a citizen of another country in the anglosphere, and through that I hope to retain my Westernized Asian identity to the best I can. I also hope I can make friends with other non-Asians who settle in China, but only if they show they have a basic respect of the local culture. I also hope that, through charitable organizations, I can support non-Chinese, non-Han minorities who are born and raised here but sadly isolated from the rest of our society. Is it only because of my experience as an Asian American do I understand what it means to be \"other\", and I am better because of it.\n\nI will respect you when I'm in your house, and you will too when you're in mine - but I will make no concessions regarding who I am, and that applies wherever I go. Place your two feet firmly on the ground and make the world move for you. \n\nIt's that simple.",

    "text": "The real reason women are not represented in tech First, I want to clarify I do not agree with the basis that women are not biologically suitable for roles in tech. I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. \n\nLet's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. \n\nThis demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!\n\nBut why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.\n\nNerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.\n\nSo they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.\n\nCompare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.\n\nThis is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.\n\nUnless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

    "text": "Ontological Commitments, Sex and Gender, by Mari Mikkola Excerpt from \"Feminist Metaphysics - Explorations in the Ontology of Sex, Gender and the Self\", edited by Charlotte Witt.\n\n***\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis chapter develops an alternative for (what feminists call) “the sex/gender distinction”. I do so in order to avoid certain problematic implications the distinction underpins. First, the sex/gender distinction paradigmatically holds that some social conditions determine one’s gender (whether one is a woman or a man), and that some biological conditions determine one’s sex (whether one is female or male). Further, sex and gender come apart. Taking gender as socially constructed, this implies that women exist mind-dependently, or due to productive human social activities; thus, it should be possible to do away with them just by altering the social conditions on which gender depends. In addition, some feminists take gender to depend on oppressive social conditions. Changing our social environments, then, would not only unwittingly eradicate women; doing away with women should be feminism’s political goal. I argue that both implications are unacceptable. In response, I argue for a view that is more congenial to ordinary thinking and that doesn’t have the goal of eradicating women.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis chapter develops a model, which I will call “the trait/norm covariance model”, as an alternative for understanding the phenomena feminists usually discuss under the rubric of the sex/gender distinction. This well-known distinction gives rise to certain problems that motivate the formulation of my alternative model. Specifically, I have in mind here problems arising from the conventionalist and abolitionist implications that the distinction underpins. First, consider the conventionalist implications: paradigmatically, some social conditions must be met in order for one to count as a woman or a man because gender is (as the slogan goes) socially constructed. One need not satisfy any biological or anatomical conditions; they are relevant only for counting as female or male. On this understanding “woman” and “man” are used as gender terms, “female” and “male” as sex terms.  The implication is that women and men exist mind-dependently or due to productive human social activities: that there are women and men ontologically depends on some social institutions and agents, their beliefs, practices and/or conventions in that women and men could not exist unless the relevant institutions, practices and conventions (with conscious agents upholding them) existed. Women and men are akin to wives, husbands and US senators that also depend on us for their existence.  This being so, it should be possible to do away with women and men while leaving the individuals we call “women” and “men” otherwise intact–we simply alter those social conditions on which gender depends so that individuals no longer count as women and men. Consider a parallel to US senators: their existence depends on certain sociopolitical conventions so that were a political revolution to alter those conventions by abolishing the US Senate, US senators would literally vanish overnight. Those individuals who previously counted as US senators would no longer do so despite being otherwise physically intact (presuming the revolution were a bloodless one). Just as one need not execute US senators in order to eradicate them, the thought is, eradicating women and men does not require physically altering those individuals we think of as women and men. Second, consider the abolitionist implication: in addition to holding a conventionalist view, some feminists take gender to depend ontologically on oppressive social conditions. As a result, changing our social environments would not only unwittingly eradicate women and men: doing away with gender should be feminism’s political goal.  \n\n\nAs I see it, both implications are problematic and ones that many ordinary social agents are unwilling to accept. Ordinarily, women are thought to be human females, men human males. As a result, their existence is not thought to depend on productive human social conventions, practices and institutions so that we could abolish women and men leaving intact females and males simply by altering our social landscapes. Conventionalist implications, then, are unintuitive. Further, ordinary social agents often find the abolitionist implication that “after the revolution” women and men will no longer exist objectionable. Many of my students, along with other feminist philosophers, do not see being a woman or a man as problematic per se. Rather, the problem is how we are viewed and treated as women and men. For ordinary thinking, then, the idea that feminists should aim to do away with women and men harbors undesirable ontological commitments.\n\nThese problems are generated by a clash between the paradigmatic feminist and everyday conceptions of sex and gender. Ordinary thinking does not separate sex and gender in the way many feminists do, thus neither seeing the existence of women and men as mind-dependent nor holding that gender is something to be eradicated. We can avoid this clash in one of two ways: either feminists work hard to modify everyday conceptions of sex and gender so that they are in line with the conventionalist and abolitionist views, or feminists modify their conceptions of sex and gender so that they are closer to everyday thinking. Here I will endorse the latter option and propose a way to conceptualize the phenomena usually discussed under the sex/gender distinction to avoid the unintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments. I will do so by developing what I will call “the trait/norm covariance model” to replace the usual sex/gender distinction. My alternative model will involve redrawing the boundaries of the sets of gender and sex traits and dividing these traits into new sets: descriptive traits (traits of which there is “a fact of the matter”) and evaluative norms (norms that express judgments about descriptive traits). For instance, the paradigmatic gender trait of wearing make-up and the paradigmatic sex trait of having ovaries will both count as descriptive traits (one either has ovaries/regularly wears make-up or not). But, my model also acknowledges the influence of social norms: certain evaluations (like being judged to act, be or appear “feminine”) can be seen to covary with particular descriptive traits, which accounts for why some traits are supposedly appropriate for women and others for men.4\n\n \n\n\n4\nBy way of illustration, I will consider Sally Haslanger’s fascinating and innovative recent account of gender (“Gender and Race”; “Future Genders”; “Social Construction”), which has the conventionalist and abolitionist implications. Next, I will examine what precisely is problematic about these implications in order to motivate my alternative model. I will then outline my trait/norm covariance model, ending with a discussion of how it avoids the problematic ontological commitments considered.\n\n**Haslanger on Gender: An Example**\n\nHaslanger’s account of gender has conventionalist and abolitionist implications: it takes the existence of women and men to be mind-dependent in the sense of depending on human social practices and conventions, and it takes these conventions and practices to be oppressive—for her, since gender is a product of oppressive social forces feminists should aim to eradicate it. These implications are underpinned by a distinction between sex and gender that many feminists have historically endorsed. Paradigmatically: “sex” denotes human females and males depending on some biological features (like chromosomes, sex organs, hormones or other physical features to do with reproduction) whereas “gender” denotes women and men depending on some social factors (like social role, position, behaviour or identity). As is well known, the motivation for drawing the sex/gender distinction was to counter biological determinism that took some (supposedly) biological facts to explain behavioural and psychological differences between women and men. Instead, feminists argued that these differences have social causes. They distinguished biological and social/psychological differences and began using the term “gender” to denote the latter. For instance, Gayle Rubin (who was one of the first feminists to articulate this distinction) used the phrase “sex/gender system” in order to describe “a set of arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (165). For Rubin, although sex differences are fixed, gender differences are the oppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and men should behave: women are oppressed as women and “by having to be women” (204). For her, gender is the social interpretation of sex and an oppressive one at that. However, women’s oppression is mutable by political and social reform that abolishes gender. As Rubin saw it, feminism should aim to create a “genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (204).\n\nFor Haslanger, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining it we must make reference to social factors (“Ontology and Social Construction” 98), and, in particular, we must make reference to unequal social positions (“Gender and Race” 37–43). In so doing, Haslanger aims to debunk the ordinary view that gender classification is a matter of anatomy. Commonly, being female is thought to be sufficient for womanhood; Haslanger, on the other hand, takes the conditions for satisfying “woman” to be social rather than biological. Her project involves showing that although the use of the term “woman” is thought to track a group of “individuals defined by a set of physical ... conditions [it] is better understood as capturing a group that occupies a certain ... social position” (“Social Construction” 318). And the social positions that our gendered classification scheme tracks and that make gender ascriptions apt crucially involve reference to subordination and privilege. For Haslanger, societies in general tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies” (“Gender and Race” 38) so that the social positions they subsequently occupy are better than the social positions of those with female bodies. And this generates sexist injustices. For her:\n\n>S is a woman if [by definition] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n\n>S is a man if [by definition] S is systematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a male’s biological role in reproduction (“Future Genders” 6–7).\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman or a man: what makes calling S a woman apt is not that S is female, but that S is oppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man apt is not that S is male, but that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that debunking projects like hers sometimes require a “radical change in our thinking” (“Social Construction” 319). After all, her proposal is counterintuitive: privileged females like, arguably, the Queen of England would not count as women on this view. But Haslanger’s project does not aim to capture what ordinary language users intuitively have in mind and her aim is not to illuminate our commonsense understandings of gender terms. Haslanger’s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists should be using (“Gender and Race” 33).  That is, endorsing her classification scheme is a pragmatic political choice. And (Haslanger holds) feminists should choose her account of gender since it will be helpful in feminist fights against sexist injustices enabling feminists to identify and explain persistent inequalities between women and men in terms of their social positions. Insofar as Haslanger takes being a woman to be a social matter crucially tied to oppression, she holds that “it is part of the project of feminism to bring about a day when there are no more women (though, of course, we should not aim to do away with females!)” (“Gender and Race” 46). Since what it is to be a woman is by definition tied to sexist oppression, gender justice would eradicate women by abolishing those social structures that are responsible for sex-marked oppression. Women and men could not exist, unless sexist oppression existed; that women and men exist is mind-dependent being the result of oppressive human social activities. And feminism’s goal should be to dismantle those social structures responsible for gender and, by extension, women and men.\n\nProblems with the Conventionalist and Abolitionist Implications\n\nEarlier I claimed that ordinary thinking finds the conventionalist and abolitionist implications of accounts like Haslanger’s problematic. I also claimed that these problems are underpinned by a clash between different conceptions of sex and gender. Let’s examine the worries in more detail.\n\nThe Conventionalist View Is Unintuitive\n\nFor Haslanger (among others) gender depends on something social and not on anything biological. This prima facie makes being a woman ontologically on a par with being a US senator, a wife or a landlord. And, it seems, just as one can cease to be a wife by changing one’s social relations (by getting a divorce), one should be able to cease to be a woman by changing those social relations constitutive of womanhood. But a closer examination suggests that being a woman is not ontologically on a par with (say) being a wife. To tease this out, consider the following claims:\n\n(1)\tFor a week last summer, James was a woman.\n\n(2)\tFor a week last summer, James was a US senator.\n\nThese statements take “woman” and “US senator” as social notions. The first takes womanhood to be about easily perceptible gender markers like clothing and appearance (James lived “as a woman” for a week last summer). The second takes James to have been treated in ways that enabled him to count as a US senator for a week (for instance, James was elected to the US Senate, but due to a political scandal lost his position very quickly). Now, consider:\n\n(3)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a woman.\n\n(4)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a US senator.\n\nThese claims are not about social factors. We can understand claim (3) and it makes sense to us, although we are clearly using “woman” as a biological term. However, when we substitute “woman” for “US senator” in (4), the statement no longer makes sense to us. After all, just by looking at one’s body, it’s not possible to know that one is a US senator. That is, when used as a social term, “woman” is on a par with “US senator”. But we can also use “woman” as a biological term, which makes “woman” and “US senator” come apart. The upshot of this is that “woman” is not a purely social term ; for ordinary thinking, then, being a woman is not on a par ontologically with what it is to be a member of some other social kind. And this suggests that it is not obviously true that women and men’s existence is minddependent in that one can cease to be a woman (or a man) just by altering one’s social environment. Because ordinary thinking does not see being a woman as a purely social matter, conventionalist implications (like the implication that we can eradicate women and men via change in our social environments) are hard to accept. The paradigmatic feminist distinction between sex and gender clashes with everyday thinking. Due to this, ordinary thinking doubts the possibility of eradicating gender via social change, because it ties sex and gender together.\n\nA defender of the conventionalist view might hold that claim (3) doesn’t really make sense either, but we are fooled into believing that it does precisely because ordinary thinking ties sex and gender together when it shouldn’t. So, if we thought about womanhood in the right way, we would see that (3) is also senseless. That would leave claim (1) where “woman” is a social notion making it akin to “US senator”. My worries about unintuitive ontological commitments are dispelled prima facie making it possible for one to cease to be a woman just by altering one’s social environment. But this raises some further questions that the defender of the conventionalist view must answer: Precisely what kind of social change would abolish women and men? Which beliefs, social conventions, linguistic practices and relations would have to be altered for one to no longer count as a woman or a man? And which social institutions, relations and structures would have to be dismantled so that women and men were to cease to exist wholesale? These questions cannot be answered in any intuitively obvious introspective manner. In fact, answering them is the stuff of feminist philosophy and a huge point of contention. Admittedly, this contention may be generated by gender being such an incredibly complex phenomenon that discerning the kind of social change that would eradicate it is extremely difficult; we may simply be ignorant of the kind of change needed, but it is possible to eradicate gender via social change. This may be so. But it may also be that feminists cannot agree on what social changes would do away with women and men because doing so just by altering one’s social environment is not possible. Bluntly put, perhaps it is just plain wrong to think that women and men’s existence ontologically depends on some social factors. I am not concluding that it is; I am merely making a strategic point. The issue of, on which social conditions the existence of women and men depends, is so intractable as to be unhelpful. If gender really is such a complex issue that it is hugely difficult (if not impossible) to articulate and agree on what sort of social change would eradicate it, the most useful move would seem to be to give up the quest. Pragmatically, feminists should not try to uncover which social factors are responsible for the existence of women and men, but, instead, should settle for the much less contentious view that human actions significantly shape the way we are as women and men. No feminist (to the best of my knowledge) denies this claim. The concerns I have raised here are not decisive and do not rule out conventionalism about gender altogether. But, as I see it, the less contentious view I have floated here is the one that feminists ought to endorse precisely because of its less contentious commitments. \n\n**The Abolitionist Implication Is Undesirable**\n\nOn views like Haslanger’s, gender is also a product of oppressive social conditions and, thus, something feminists should seek to abolish. But this abolitionist view may not be conducive to feminist interests since for ordinary thinking it harbours undesirable ontological commitments. To tease this out, contrast such abolitionist strategies with a different (what I will call) “re-evaluative” strategy. They both have the same starting point: feminism is about ending oppression that women as women face. But their ways of achieving this goal differ, which alters the strategies’ outcomes. Abolitionist accounts take womanhood to be by definition tied to oppression so that it is not possible to be a woman and not be (in some sense) oppressed. Reevaluative accounts do not take being a woman to be per se oppressive. Instead, they recognise that our social circumstances create environments where women are viewed and treated in ways that disadvantage them, perhaps by associating some traits with women and using this association to justify disadvantageous treatment. Nonetheless, by altering how women are viewed and treated it is possible to be a woman and yet not be oppressed. So, on the former view, gender justice would dismantle unjust social hierarchies thus doing away with women and men; on the latter, it would dismantle such hierarchies while retaining women and men (roughly) in a re-evaluated sense.\n\nThe strategy to follow comes down to a pragmatic political choice. But if ordinary social agents think that eradicating gender is undesirable, it may be strategically wrongheaded to endorse an account of gender that has abolitionist implications. Some anecdotal evidence supports this: my feminism students tell me time and again that they think the abolitionist strategy is aiming to eradicate something that need not be eradicated—the “feminist revolution” need not do away with gender and doing so would result in (at least some) good being unnecessarily lost. Many insist that the ways in which people are treated as woman and men is the problem feminists should focus on—being a woman or a man is not primarily the problem. And many claim to find their gender a source of positive value. After all, it is certainly true that, although one may be discriminated against due to one’s gender, it can still be something one values positively; in a similar sense, one can take pride in one’s racial group membership despite being socially disadvantaged by it. The everyday conception of gender clashes with feminist conceptions like Haslanger’s. As a result, ordinary thinking doubts the viability of eradicating gender because it sees gender as being at least partly a positive social identity rather than being a wholly negative one.\n\nProjects like Haslanger’s do, of course, start by aiming to alter the ways in which we are viewed and treated as women and men. So, in a sense, the abolitionist and re-evaluative routes go hand-in-hand to begin with. But the abolitionist strategy runs into difficulties if many social agents are unwilling to follow it through. Haslanger is asking for a significant shift in people’s self-conceptions and acknowledges that she is asking social agents to understand themselves in ways that are not ordinarily part of their gendered self-understandings (“Gender and Race” 48). In so doing, she is “call[ing] upon us to reject what seemed to be positive social identities” and to refuse to be gendered women and men (“Gender and Race” 48). I agree with Haslanger that a change in our self-understandings is called for; but I wonder if the change that she is calling for is the right kind of change given that ordinary thinking does not see the viability of eradicating gender. Again, my point is strategic: accounts that have abolitionist implications are likely to be extremely demanding. It will take a lot of convincing to make ordinary social agents view their gender as not being even in part a positive social identity and to make them refuse to be gendered women and men, if social agents do not believe to begin with that this is necessary. And, one might wonder, whether scarce feminist resources should be directed at something other than trying to convince social agents to revise their self-understandings in this manner.\n\nFortunately my students always do express a desire to see an end to gendered oppression. And clearly this is what Haslanger also wants, which may suggest that really the parties to the debate are just talking past each other. Everyone wants the same thing: gender justice. Haslanger’s rhetoric just differs from how we ordinarily talk about women and men. Usually, acknowledging this does not dispel my students’ worries; they still find it puzzling that Haslanger doesn’t use gender terms as people ordinarily do and wonder why she is confusing matters with her conception of gender. Of course, Haslanger’s rhetoric has a specific, valuable purpose: to motivate a certain kind of social and political response that undermines sexist oppression. But, given the kinds of worries I have mentioned here, strategically I think that this kind of response can be better motivated by understanding the phenomena feminists discuss under the rubric of sex and gender in a way that does not imply women and men no longer exist “after the revolution”. The worry is that accounts with abolitionist implications probably would not motivate positive social change, if this change requires that social agents must give up something they do not want to give up.\n\n**The Trait/Norm Covariance Model**\n\nThis section develops my trait/norm covariance model as an alternative to the sex/gender distinction. To begin with, it is important to note that, contrary to traditional feminist views, I do not take the term “woman” to be a purely social gender term. Ordinary speakers have, to use Ron Mallon’s terminology, indicative features in mind when they call someone a “woman”:\n\n>there is a distinction between those properties that are indicative of category membership (such as easily perceptible racial [or gender] markers), and those that are central. A property is indicative of category membership if having the property increases the likelihood that one is a member of a category. In the United States wearing a dress is indicative of being a woman ... [But w]earing a dress is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a woman.\n\n(652–3)\n\nIndicative features of womanhood include one’s appearance (clothing, hairstyles, make-up); behavioural patterns; social roles; and anatomical and bodily features (body type, shape, size, amount of body hair and how one “carries” one’s body). These features are conceivably involved in everyday gender ascriptions. Paradigmatically, feminists hold that the indicative features mentioned are not exclusively gender traits in that they include features which are taken to be paradigmatic sex traits (to do with being female or male). But, ordinary language users often deploy “woman” on the basis of anatomical sex features such as body type; “woman” is not a purely gender term for them, but (bluntly put) a mixture of sex and gender. So, ordinarily “woman” denotes individuals who are taken to possess features indicative of womanhood. This does not (and certainly should not) limit the application of “woman” to women-born-female; the term also applies to trans women, individuals “assigned male at birth whose gender presentation may be construed as ‘unambiguously’ female” (Bettcher 46), who call themselves “women”.\n\nMy contention is that feminists should use the term “woman” as ordinarily as possible. And the trait/norm covariance model that I will outline next will be sensitive to these reflections about ordinary language use. The model I am proposing deals roughly with the same phenomena that the sex/gender distinction does. It just understands that phenomena in a different way that is, I submit, more fruitful in being more congenial to everyday thinking. On my view, we redraw the boundaries of the sets of gender traits and sex traits giving up the labels “sex” and “gender” to denote those traits. Instead, the traits are divided into sets of descriptive traits and evaluative norms. The former (in a sense) describe “the way the world is” and include physical and anatomical traits (e.g., chromosomes, ovaries, testes, genitalia, body shape and size), one’s appearance (e.g., one’s clothing, make-up, haircut, amount of body hair), roles (e.g., whether one undertakes caretaking roles, engages in childrearing tasks) and self-conceptions (calling oneself a woman or a man). These are features of which there are “facts of the matter”—it isn’t in any sense mysterious or down to value judgements whether one has ovaries, undertakes childrearing tasks, or calls oneself a woman. (This does not mean that values were not involved in singling out descriptive features, like anatomical traits, or that descriptive features are not socially malleable; but more on this shortly.) Evaluative norms are to do with stereotypical judgements: whether one is judged to be, to appear to be and/or to act in ”feminine”, ”masculine” or “neutral” ways. Evaluative norms attributed reflect value judgements and cultural norms. So, on my and the paradigmatic feminist schemas:\n\n Paradigmatic feministmodel|.. |Trait/normcovariancemodel | ..\n--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------\nSex\t               |Gender                 |Descriptive traits\t   |Evaluative norms\nHaving ovaries\t|Wearing make-up |Having ovaries\t           |Being “feminine”\n\t                |Being “feminine”   |Wearing make-up\t|\n\nWhat does it mean to say that evaluative norms covary with descriptive traits? Just that we take certain traits to be of certain kind. So, the trait/norm covariance relation is constituted by particular descriptive traits being viewed in a particular manner by us. I take “femininity” to mean “associated with women”, “masculinity” to mean “associated with men” and “neutrality” to mean “associated with neither or both”. That is, depending on how we view particular descriptive traits, they either covary with femininity, masculinity or neutrality. And certain trait/norm pairings are currently linked to women, others to men and still others to neither or both. They can be so linked in a global or (more often than not) in a local manner. For instance, being short-sighted is globally neutral: as far as I know, the trait is nowhere associated exclusively with either women or men thereby globally covarying with neutrality. Then again, possession of testes appears to be globally masculine, possession of ovaries globally feminine. Quite often, though, the trait/norm pairings are local differing from one context to the next and depending on social and cultural factors. So, although all cultures have traits that covary with femininity and others that covary with masculinity, the configurations of these trait/norm pairings can differ depending on their location. To illustrate, take long hair. In many UK communities it is no longer strongly associated with women and often covaries with neutrality. However, in UK Asian-Indian communities that do not consider it appropriate for those picked out by “woman” to have short hair, having long hair covaries more strongly with femininity. But, of course, other social and cultural axes affect this covariance relation even within a culture: in many UK Indian Sikh contexts, neither men nor women are expected to cut their hair, which suggests that (in these social contexts) having long hair covaries with neutrality. However, in these contexts, other practices to do with hair covary with femininity and masculinity, like the practice of Sikh men wearing turbans. The trait/norm pairings are interrelated: with those picked out by “man”, the pairing “having long hair/neutrality” is interrelated with “wearing a turban/masculinity”; but for those picked out by “woman” the former pairing is not interrelated with the latter pairing. (For more on Asian social conventions to do with hair, see Hiltebeitel and Miller.) The trait/norm covariance relations can also change over time. Wearing trousers is a good example: until quite recently in many Western Anglo-European contexts, masculinity covaried with it. But, relatively quickly, in many contexts it has become neutral. It is now socially acceptable for someone ordinarily picked out by “woman” to wear trousers. The same social value is no longer attached to this trait. Of course, this all further demonstrates that the ways in which the trait/norm covariance relations pan out are not always straightforward. Since the relations depend on beliefs and conventions that change over time and place, they will usually be manifestations of some local and contextspecific beliefs and conventions. There are many complications not least because of differences in contexts and in what norms social agents project on descriptive traits. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that sometimes seeing how the relations pan out is not complicated and that sometimes social agents do not differ significantly in their ascriptions of norms.\n\nI have said that certain descriptive traits covary with certain evaluative norms, but what explains this covariance relation? I take the existence of this relation to be a thoroughly mind-dependent matter. If you like, wearing make-up and engaging in child-care (to name two descriptive traits) are not inherently or mind-independently feminine–that femininity covaries with them is something that depends for its existence on social factors and obtains because of us. The classification scheme of feminine, masculine and neutral evaluative norms is a strong pragmatic construction; that is, social factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent accurately any “facts of the matter” (Haslanger, “Ontology and Social Construction” 100). So, the classification scheme does not pick out any mind-independent facts about descriptive traits. That some traits are viewed as feminine, masculine or neutral is a consequence of “human-made” fashions, styles, cultural beliefs, social conventions and linguistic practices, which determine what features are judged to be of what kind. The classification scheme of feminine/masculine/neutral is a mere social construction. Furthermore, this scheme tends to be hierarchal in grading traits; this is evident from the devaluing of many activities and features with which femininity covaries (like the devaluing of caretaking work).\n\nOn my model the claim “Jane is feminine because Jane wears make-up” does not capture any mind-independent fact about the world. Yet, my model also takes wearing make-up to be a descriptive trait of which there is “a fact of the matter”. So, it appears that saying Jane wears make-up does capture something mind-independent about the world. It is worth clarifying the notion of mind-independence here to avoid an air of inconsistency. Consider driving. In the United Kingdom, people drive on the left-hand side of the road; in the United States, they drive on the right. Which convention is the correct or true one? We cannot say because the context-specific conventions that govern driving are mind-dependent: they depend for their existence on productive human social practices and require that certain human-made background conditions are in place. Such conventions are, of course, mutable. The UK government could just decide to alter conventions governing driving. Obviously doing so in practice would be hugely difficult and certainly no easy feat. But the point is that ultimately conventions come down to us—there is no mind-independent fact about which side of the road is the correct side for driving. However, that people drive on the left in the United Kingdom is mind-independent in another sense. When I state “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” I am stating something that is true mind-independently: the truth of the statement is not (if you like) up for grabs. I cannot just decide that the statement is false and drive on the right. (Or, I could, but probably with quite tragic results.) So, given certain background conditions, it is a mind-independent fact that in the United Kingdom people drive on the left irrespective of the fact that the convention to drive on the left is minddependent.\n\nThe descriptive trait of wearing make-up is akin to the convention of driving on the left: it is mind-dependent in that it is a trait that depends for its existence on particular human-made social conditions (it requires that certain human-made background conditions are in place). The trait is also socially mutable: wearing make-up might, for example, go out of fashion thus prompting people to abandon the practice. Nonetheless, that Jane wears make-up is (in another sense) mind-independent. The truth or falsity of the statement “Jane wears make-up” is not up for grabs: either she does or she doesn’t. This is akin to the claim “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left”: however mind-dependent—due to productive human activities— the respective conventions (to drive on the left and to wear make-up) are, whether the statements “Jane wears make-up” and “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” are true or false is not open to debate given our current conventions. By contrast, the claim “The convention to drive on the left is better than the convention to drive on the right” is utterly mind-dependent. Whether this statement is thought to be true or false depends on one’s view or opinion, in addition to the convention to drive on the left being a product of human social practices. \n\nNow, although it is a mind-independent feature of reality that Jane wears makeup, that Jane acts in a feminine way because she wears make-up is mind-dependent. It does not capture any mind-independent facts about the world, like some supposed fact that the practice of wearing make-up is inherently feminine. That femininity covaries with wearing make-up is mind-dependent obtaining due to productive human activities—because of us. This further illustrates that the trait/norm covariance relation is not a causal relation in the sense that the former causes the latter.\n\nChildcare activities or the practice of wearing make-up do not cause femininity to covary with them; rather, our beliefs and judgements cause this. To illustrate, think about morality. Standardly moral philosophers agree that the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness. But does the act cause moral goodness? This depends on one’s metaethical commitments. For some moral realists, the answer might be yes: the act of giving to charity instantiates a realist (non-natural) moral property of goodness. So, the act of giving to charity literally causes moral goodness to pop up in the world because one’s actions instantiate the property of goodness. For moral constructivists, however, the answer might be no: the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness because we project moral goodness onto the act of giving to charity. Roughly, we have constructed a moral world in which giving to charity is considered good. So, the relation between giving to charity and moral goodness is not a causal one in that the former causes the latter. That giving to charity is considered to be morally good is down to us. The same appears to be true of what I have said about descriptive traits and evaluative norms: we have constructed a gendered world in which childcare and wearing make-up are considered to be feminine. That is, we— human social agents—are responsible for these covariance relations. And this being fortunately the case, we can also alter them so that childcare, for instance, no longer covaries with femininity.\n\n[continued below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6yp60e/ontological_commitments_sex_and_gender_by_mari/dmp1uid/)",

However I have removed all the crashes, fixed the bugs, rolled out several new features, and am working on a major user requested feature currently which I hope to complete before the end of probation.\n\nMy thoughts are that im not sure the companies intention, would they likely keep me on as im the only dev for iOS? its not a core part of their business (they make other hardware and iOS is the remote for it), further to this if i am offered the role fully, i really wanted to negotiate more money for the risk of working there.\n\nBased on what ive achieved and how i am not part of a team as promised, i was hoping to at least get the 30k allocated to the role when i started, and ideally, push for 34k as i want to be getting 2k a month post tax.\n\nI am 26 and wanted to move out so the salary and job security are important for me to progress my life. However i wasn't sure how to handle negotiation post probation, how can i approach the salary and should i be looking for job prospects elsewhere if they say no? The CEO is asian and the business operates in a pretty asian style.\n\nI can provide any further background needed, ive tried to be thorough, i just want to make sure i approach this correctly to achieve what I want in the best method!\n\nAppreciate time and help on this matter.",

    "text": "Tried making a joke at work, did I come across racist? \nI just started my job, I love it. It's in a field I've wanted to work in for a long time. The hours are flexible and the pay isn't bad. The people so far are nice enough and I get along really well with my manager. \n\nThe other day I saw the ceo of the company at a restaurant and I excitedly posted on a group chat that he was behind me at the restaurant. Someone asked where I was. I thought it'd be funny if I said the most unlikely restaurant he'd be at, and I named a cheap local fried chicken chain. I didn't get much response after that. \n\nThe next day I felt like my manager was kind of avoiding me and it dawned on me this weekend that perhaps I came across as racist. Most of my coworkers are African American, and I'm not [I'm Asian]. \n\nWas it racist of me to post that? Or am I over analyzing the situation? I would hate for things to be awkward at work given how great things are going. I know the rule is for jokes at work is, if you have to ask yourself if it's inappropriate, then it probably is. I really had no racist intent but I feel bad. What do you think? And what should I do about it?\n\nTL;DR made a joke on group chat, worried I came off racist, wondering what to do",

    "text": "Never Tolerate Disrespect Just Because She’s Powerful Several years ago, I was subjected to a level of disrespect from a fellow human being that I refused to let go unpunished. At the time, I was at a company weekend getaway that was held in a lavish resort. It was a glorified piss-up, and all expenses were paid by the corporate managers. On the second night the bar closed early, so we decided to go off in different groups throughout the resort, have more drinks, and enjoy the night. In the spirit of getting to know fellow members of the company from other branches, I went off to different groups and spent time with them. I was treated with respect by many of my fellow workers, and it turned out to be a great opportunity for networking. However, upon introducing myself to one group, I was treated with utter disrespect by one of the National Managers. She was a small Asian woman who was high on God-knows what, and drunk off her face. After I walked in and introduced myself to the others, she started screaming at me like an unstable maniac:\n\n\n\n\n“Who the fuck are you? Guys, seriously who the fuck is that in our room?! I’ve never seen him before – why the fuck is he looking at me? WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!!” she then screamed in an utterly abusive tone. One of the guys came up to me and apologetically suggested that I leave; explaining that she had had too much to drink. I was very disappointed that I didn’t get to meet more of my co-workers, and also that a National Manager had treated me in such a way. I refused to let this go down without a fight. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday I approached my boss and told her what had happened. She was outraged, and suggested that I make a formal complaint. The next day, I met up with the Deputy CEO and the General Manager of the company. I had no hope. Both of them were women, and they were on excellent terms with the National Manager who had abused me. According to them, the National Manager had a “natural charm”, and was “a lovely person” normally. Still, they got this unstable woman with a psychology degree to give me a call to apologize; which turned out to be very forced. I told that her that her behaviour had been unacceptable, and that the reason I had made a formal complaint was that I had been treated in such a way by a National Manager of all people. \n\n\n\n\nThree months later, I was out of the company, and the National Manager had been promoted.",

    "text": "ELLA - independent short film about Asian Americans in the midwest! Hey, my name is Douglas Kim, I'm a writer/producer living in Los Angeles.\n\nI'm producing a short film of a coming of age story that takes place in small town America.  The film follows the unlikely bond between Abe, a high school recluse and Ella, a charismatic college dropout, as they navigate the streets and social groups of their community.\n\nThe film features a notable Asian TV actor (Nichole Bloom of NBC's \"Superstore\"), offers a new setting for an Asian American story, and follows Asian characters who are integrated in their community, going through universal struggles while dealing with their outsider status in subtle but real ways.\n\nThe film will use an experimental, one-of-a-kind, camera rig that allows for a digital IMAX image.\n\nWith the success of Moonlight and other independent films, it's my belief that film is the way Asian Americans become normalized in America, where we can be seen as Americans pursuing our own version of the American dream.  I think we can accomplish that and more with our film.\n\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid\n\nWould love it if you can support and share our vision!\n\n\nmore from the director, Dan Chen:\n\nNichole Bloom and Dan Chen have been friends since they attended USC. After Nichole’s successful climb into American television, and Dan’s online awards for his short films (danchen.co), the two decided to collaborate once more on a character-driven project with the intention of festival recognition, online release, and a proof-of-concept for universal Asian American stories.\n\nDan, on the film’s story: “The underlying theme is one of “selling out,” as Abe distances himself from Ella to fit in with new kids he’s met. As an outsider, can he only fit in by submitting to the dominant views of his peers? Or is there a way he can stay loyal to his loved ones, without being left out of the larger community? The film’s story is character-driven and specific, but acts as a metaphor for the Asian American experience. Do we stay in our place, assimilate, or somehow find a third way of being?”\n\nThe camera rig was built by cinematographer Philips Shum, who has shot music videos featuring Diddy, Schoolboy Q, and Drake. It uses the principal of 35mm lens adapters, while increasing the size to accommodate a 56mm x 56mm frame, to create a low-budget solution for an IMAX field of view.\n\nElla is to be produced by Eric Cook and Douglas Kim with Evidence Films, Varient Entertainment, and Justice Tech Industries attached.",

The company is a curated lunch delivery service in Boston, focusing on healthy, sustainable, farm-to-table meals for corporate lunches. The job would oversee their kitchen operations, handle customer relations, receive inventory, supervise kitchen employees, and work with the founders on development and growth.\n\nI'm super in to cooking and lived in Thailand for several months (relevant because many of their dishes are Asian-inspired) and was thinking about dropping off a physical application... along with 4 homemade Thai-inspired salad bowl meals in compostable packaging. There are 4 core staff listed on their website, so that's why I chose 4 lunches. I make a pretty impressive salad bowl (greens, grains, tofu, veggies, dressing sauce) and am hoping it'll get me some attention.\n\nI was thinking that in my resume, I could talk about the reasons I chose each aspect of the bowl (not in too much detail, but e.g. choosing Barley as a grain because it is readily grown in North America, whereas most quinoa is imported from South America, thus having a higher carbon footprint; the packaging I chose, etc.). \n\nIn terms of how qualified I am for the job, I do have ample experience managing small teams, 1 year working in an actual restaurant, 2+ years experience in a customer service job, 1 season of farming experience, experience working with chefs to curate their veggie orders (part of my farming experience), and 1 year experience working for a small environmental non-profit (3-5 people). So I might not be the strongest candidate given the job description, but definitely do have some relevant experience and am SUPER passionate about sustainable food systems in urban settings. \n\nJust looking for some opinions on this idea - is it too presumptuous? Insight from hiring managers or co-founders of start-ups particularly appreciated. Thanks!",

    "text": "[California] Indian-American and I believe I am receiving discrimination at my workplace. Do I have any recourse? A year ago I got hired to a pretty diverse team. The original manager of the department was great and my work environment was okay. About 6 months ago our manager got replaced by a new manager; who I will call Bob. Everything seemed normal and Bob was professional with all of us. Gradually though I notice signs that I am on the receiving end of discrimination. \n\nOur department was originally a quarter Indian. My coworkers left for multiple reasons unrelated to Bob but none terminated. I noticed that Bob replaced them all with White or Eastern-Asian ultimately making me the only Indian in the team. \n\nThis made me suspect something but I brushed it off that it was a coincidence. About 2 months ago, I was not assigned to be a Project Lead after I finished a project that was leftover from my old manager. When we got more projects, Bob gave all of my coworkers some form of project lead position except for me. I was assigned purely as a supporter role. Our old workflow was that everyone was a lead for one project and was a supporter role for a different project. I was the only one that was overlooked for a Project Lead role. The replacements got Project Lead with one receiving two projects. I brought this up with Bob and he brushed it off with that he'd like someone purely concentrated on one role as a contingency; so far I am the only one that has one role. \n\nThe gossiper on my team made an off-remark of how my boss does not trust Indians. I concluded that this was the reason Bob chose not to hire Indians and passed me over. \n\nI requested a transfer to HR and told them that I suspected discrimination as my reason. HR denied my request because the branch did not allow transfers and my claims were \"unsubstantiated\". Apparently they interviewed the gossiper and he denied what he told me. Now everyone is keeping their distance from me. \n\nI would like to quit but reviewing my situation I have concluded that I cannot quit for at least a year. Its a combination of personal professional reasons. \n\nWhat are my options? I am lost on how to handle this.",

    "text": "How to find low competition job or how to choose career ? Hi all, my name is Tony and i am 25 yr old. I would like to share my experience in choosing career and picking jobs... \n\nI would like to ask you for career advice...  \n\nI dont know where to start so i will just write down what ever come to my mind...\n\nLike every teenager i had to choose path(career) for myself and work hard to make a living. I started in Video (DVD) store as general labour when i was 18. After that i moved to Australia because all of this \"good life articles\" etc.  \n\nI decided to start with building (construction) because it was fairly easy to get into and money was decent... I was planning to master one field in construction and to become professional...\n  \nI did not count on bullying, pain, long hours, and terrible working conditions, but i was like : \"Hey whatever in few years it will be beneficial if i stay here...\"  \n\nThen after 6-8 month`s i started realising that i would probably need 10 years in this industry to become Master... even than i would need to break my back in order to earn good money (Still you need to fight with customers, run for contactors to pay you the money that you already earn etc...)\n  \nSo i Quited, and i decided to become Security equipment installed, because i finished 4 years DC / low voltage electronic school in Europe (whatever i knew some basics etc...)\n\nI got job, and i started to learn about Alarms, Cameras, Access controls and many other electronic devices...  \n\nI can say that i was really good at it after 1 year, i was able to do solo installation, programming, troubleshooting etc...\n\nAfter that i realised that if you want to have decent money you would need to have your own company (vehicle, tools, customer base etc etc... and still you would have to chase new customers, keep old ones, and a lot more things in order to survive...)\n\nWhen i first started i saw ad`s such as \"75.000$ year, your own vehicle bla bla...\" i was thinking wtf this is gold mine...  \n\nIn reallity, to earn 75.000 you would need to work 7 days a week, and like 12 hours shifts, and to deal with crazy people, shty jobs, far away locations, + you would need at least 10+ years of experience...\n\nAll in all it was shty job, it`s not about how smart you are, its about how fast can you climb on ladders, or run cables on 10m heights, how good you are with hammer drill (not to mention, if you hit pipe or something you would have to pay all damage...)  \n\nSo i quited... Next thing i was get into was factory labour, becase i tough it`s secure job, not that much stress, little bit less money but why not ?!\n\nI manage to get job in factory with 23.5$/ hourly as product line labour... i was really happy (first day)...  \n\nThan i found out that you have to do 12-14 hours shifts with 300 asians ( NOTHING AGAINST ASIANS ) , they have to work 12-16 hours hard labour work in order to stay in country... so you have low chance to compete with them, and there is no room for any kind of complain...  \n\nI Asked my manager after 3-4 month of that shty job, is there any chance to work on promotion, like to become supervisor or something that is not HARD LABOUR 100%, (this job was lifting 10-30 KG constantly for 12 hours minimum, fast paced environment), and She told me yes, there is... Usually you need to work for the company for 5 years and to stay alive without injury or something... and than they can consider option to give you better position or something (for 2-3$ extra)...  \n\nLong story-short i quited after 6 month of that work...  \nI was desperate and almost suicidal because i was lost i had no idea what to do... Than i decided to get into programming because i used to do web development when i was 16-18...  \n\nSimply i started with JavaScript, PhP, Css etc... i decided that i am going to sacrifice 2 years of my life, on everyday learning...  \n\nI finished at least 10 books, 20 online courses from codeacademy, udemy, linda etc... I have like 30 personal websited, bunch of small codes, projects, small web apps, forums, social ETC...  \n\nSo i decided to do job hunt... I managed to find one company (12 yr old with a lot of clients etc.) , guy offered me position to work for free, and to get some experience even if i have 2+ years experience (+ fiver gigs, upwork freelance etc)...  \n\nI worked first 2 weeks for nothing and it was ok for me because i needed formal exp, than he offered me 200$ week 5/7 days, and that is WAY BEYOND MINIMUM WAGE, it`s 5$/hour in Australia...  \n\nMinimum Wage is 15.5$ even if you do most shty job...  \nAnyway i accepted... , after few more weeks i heard my boss talking about \"Overseas monkeys\", how they work for nothing etc...  \n\nSo yeah i quited..., and i tried with other ad`s...  \nProblem is in outsorcing, it`s hard to compete with Indians (NOTHING AGAINST INDIANS) , because they can work for 5$ whole day from India...  \n\nFor entry level jobs in Web - Dev, just check ads , you have to know : html,css/bootstrap/less/sass/js/frameworks/jquery/php/larver/other frameworks/wordpress/customisation/themes/React/Angular/Git/ and all kind of sht...  in order to get entry lvl job...  \n\nSo my 2 years of hardwork+learning = entry lvl job = FAIL\n\nTo be expert or at least fluent with all of these technology above you would need at least 3-4 years + work experience (that you probably wont get, how to find job with out exp... + industry) is already FULL of \"Web developers\" and other specialists...  \n\nAnyway i will continue with improvements and with learning new technologies and programming languages but not that intensive like i used to, because i lost faith about becoming web-dev.  \nReason is simple, How to risk 5-10yrs of your life, with constantly learning new tech, 12 hours of coding, fixing things etc... when you know that all your hard work can be outsorced (overseas) for 5$ etc... I dont know tbh it kinda sux... Not worth at all, it`s all because articles such as \"Web developers earning bunch of $$$\", \"top 10 jobs - #3 web design\", etc.... It`s double side coin but yeah i was naive ^^..  \n\nWell i decided to become \"smart\", and to do big re-search before i dive into new \"career\"... I wanted to do something with low competition, or something that is fairly easy to get into junior position roles. Only thing i wanted is job where you can improve your skills and progress, example: \"road from junior front end dev to Web master bla bla\"...  \n\nSo i saw article \"Nurse shortage in Australia\"...  \nnext ting i done is checking payscale: 65.000-110.000$ , i was :  \n\"Why not ?! , there will be blood but what ever, i like to help people, its decend career with oportunity to specialise latter on etc\"... To become nurse you can go Tafe 1.5 year , or Uni 3 years  \nand i saw info \"86% our students get job even before course ends\" bla bla... I was so happy, because i found something cool, that is worth doing(studying)...  \n\nI did some more research :), and i found out that there is no f***** nurse shortage in Australia, and that it`s only Goverment politics to get more immigrants for some reason i dont know why and i dont care...   Just i found out that out of 4000 new graduate nurses , only 20% are lucky to get job`s, and not the hospital ones... Those jobs are in rural areas, or age care homes far away from cities etc...  \n\nSo i was ohhh thx god i saw all this info, and read all this forum posts, because if i went 3 years to become Nurse (+i would have to work / study and to pay bills by myself etc. struggle) and to find out on the end that there is like 0.001% chance to find job, i dont know i would jump from bridge... \n\nThen i started to looking for something else ofc... and i was thinking, what is fairly BORING, and hard job that not much ppl want or like to do ?! It`s Networking (cyber security etc)... I know that a lot of ppl is passionate about that, and its actually very interesting field, but tbh for most ppl its boring, hard etc...  \nI decided to do re-search of that field...  \n\nLong story short: There is not enough networking job ad`s (in general, network admins, security, all-fields)  \nand existing ads in Australia (at least QLD,VIC) looking for 5+ years experience, list of things you need to know even for entry lvl job with 40.000-50.000$ (that ok money for me, but if you compare it with things/skills that you need to have under your belt this salary SUUUUUUUX)...  also market/industry going up and down, and even 10+ yr experienced guys have hard time to keep or to find new job...  (Tbh , WTF ?!)  \n\nSo i gave up on all those things, and i did google search on low competition jobs (in Australia), and only thing i managed to find is \"Mining jobs\" (I dont want to be rude or arrogant, but only dirty jobs...)  \n\nFinally... My question is: what i suppose to do ? I can become removalist or something like that, because my back will break before 35, and what to do than ? Same thing for coffe or barista... Everyone looking for young ppl, and everyone like femals over males, so it`s not career to get into really...  \n\nIs there some kind of certificate such as CCNA (cisco), or Nurse (diploma), that can really boost your % chances to get a job ?  \n\nAny idea, opinion, advice or anything else is more than welcome.\n\nThank you",

    "text": "The worst workplace ever I'm an 18 years old Asian girl currently working at a Bubble Tea store as a part time worker. The minimum hourly wage in Ontario is $11.40, but I only get $8 per hour (btw I got only $6.5 one year ago when I was being in a training period). Nonetheless, I still work there due to my broken English. \nEven so, there is only one worker working in the store majority of the time and two workers on the busy weekend. It is so ill-conceived for the workload. I often have to stay there extra half hour more for cleaning up and serving customers without getting paid. Sometimes, they even request me to be there earlier than I'm supposed to. They consider these as obligations and make me feel morally guilty if I refuse to.\nAs I mentioned above,there is only one worker majority of the time. I can't even have my meals properly. If there are customers, I have to give up eating and serve them. The thing pissing me off is that my manager would monitor how many time do I waste on eating my meals through closed-circuit television. She says it's morally unacceptable for workers spending more than 10 minutes on eating meals.\nI really want to quit the workplace!!!",

    "text": "Casual racism ***** EDIT: Wow, this post got significantly more attention than I expected. Thanks for all the advice and support (and zealous arguments about when stores should and should not allow more customers inside). I will be reporting this employee, mainly because while I do believe that there was wrong on both sides (but thanks to all of you who clearly offer amazing customer service), and I should just get over it, there is something to be said about speaking out about these matters, especially when prior generations have not. Who knows if it makes a difference, but it seems to at least have sparked some discussion here. I'm not going to insist on his firing or other retribution, if they would even do so in the first place; I can totally understand if this guy had a bad day and needed to take it out on someone. But the company should know if a branch allowed an employee to scream at a customer and did not address it immediately.\n\nObviously there's a lot of overt racism in the US, and it's been at a head for a long time now. There is every day violence committed against blacks and Muslims, and the statistics are there to prove it. I'm glad we talk about that. I hope that we can also talk about how comments about one's English or consumption of domestic animals is destructive too. No need to rank racism; it's all bad. For those who asked why saying \"ni hao\" is frustrating, rude, and yes, racist--I speak English. Why are those people assuming that I don't? *****\n\n\nI apologize beforehand if this isn't the right forum, but I need a place to vent, and this subreddit has always been one of the more open ones on this site. I went home this past weekend while studying for Step 1, and my dad offered to drive me back to my apartment as I don't live too far from school. He really wanted to stop by Sam's Club to pick up some fruit for me to take back, and even though I didn't think it was worth the effort, especially since it was nearing closing time, I said okay, because it's nice when your parents want to be nice to you, you know? We got to Sam's Club literally a minute before it closed, and my dad rushed inside while I parked. I decided to just wait for him outside the doors and was standing there when the guy who checks receipts called me inside and asked me if I was with the person who had just run in. He then proceeded to berate me for my dad coming in at closing time. (Edit: I did in fact tell him we were just getting one thing, in English, for those saying I shouldn't have just walked away. But no one has time to be yelled at once you're trying to be reasonable.) I walked away because no one has time to deal with that, and as I was walking away, he said, \"Maybe if I speak your language, ni hao ni hao, you’ll understand.\" I went to the cash registers and asked for the supervisor. When I told her what had happened and what this man had said, he ran up from the doors and started screaming in my face about how I was \"lying on [him].\" He continued to yell that I was lying (honestly if I were going to lie, I would have come up something slightly more creative). The manager said he was just trying to do his job.\n\nI was so frustrated and upset, and I continue to be despite sleeping on it. My dad does not want me to report this person because my dad is a good person and at about the zenith of non-confrontational, and he doesn't think this employee should be at risk for losing his job. But for me, not saying anything feels like implicitly condoning this behavior. Yes, we were in the wrong for entering this store at closing time--that one pack of strawberries better be the best I've ever had--but that didn’t justify outright racism and aggression. I don't know how many times I have heard \"ni hao\" as an insult/pick-up line/greeting and how many times I have been congratulated on not having an accent. I have been followed down the street and called a cunt because I told a stranger that addressing me with \"ni hao\" was impolite. I know this is something that people of color confront on a daily basis and that we are meant to speak out when it happens, but… it's hard, guys. Racism directed at Asians and Asian-Americans in particular seems like the last bastion of racism in comedy (see: Steve Harvey), the last and most insidious form of undercutting a whole group of people. It feels like no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I dedicate my professional (and whatever is left of my personal) life to trying to take care of people, how much my parents have sacrificed, that I can be leveled with the basest of insults.",

    "text": "In light of the #MeToo thing blowing up on social media, I decided to share my story which I've never fully known how to define and always felt guilty over.. Seeing #MeToo all over my social media today has been so exhausting. Since scrolling through so many of the same posts I've felt anxious, upset, and physically ill. Having the experiences of so many people thrust into my face has been incredibly overwhelming and just keeps reminding me of my own story, a story that I still to this day have not ever fully come to terms with. \n\n\nThe reason I still feel this way about my experience almost 3 years later is because I never knew how to define it. I never felt it was valid enough to call what happened to me sexual assault or \"rape\". I'm hoping that by sharing my story I can get some opinions from this community to try and help decipher what actually happened. I've never talked about it with anyone (the details anyway) and I'd like to just start by saying thank you to everyone who has even made it this far through my post. \n\n\nSo, about 2ish years ago I was going through a rough patch. \nMy parents and I have never gotten along (traditional Asian immigrant family/parent-child dynamic) and I have always been rather rebellious and angsty. We had moved away from Virginia (the 4th time I was having to transfer schools, this time in the middle of my sophomore year of high school) and I was particularly hating Maryland (where we moved to) and having an extremely hard time settling in and being happy where we were. My ex and I had broken up the summer before and all of the past year I had been going through what I call my \"tramp-age\" where I was just doing whatever and whoever I wanted without care or fear of judgement. Some might say my \"daddy issues\" are what pushed me to do it and I might agree, but really it was just the excitement that got me on the sugar daddy dating site Seeking Arrangement. \n\nFast forward to when the incident ocurred: I had met this 40 something man who had a 21 year old girlfriend. According to him, they were on the site because his girlfriend found sex to be too painful so basically he wanted someone he could get his rocks off with which apparently his girlfriend was okay with. The first time I hung out with them I spent the night at their apartment after getting drunk (I was 19 btw) and the boyfriend and I had sex while the girl watched/was in the room. Sex was meh, I wasn't particularly into it and eventually felt pretty sore and it was getting kind of painful. Thankfully he finished quickly though and everything was all good. It was just bad sex basically. The next morning when he walked me to my car he hands me $200 to thank me for my services I guess. $200! To me, that was a Lot of money at the time. A few weeks later, he hits me up again asking to hang out. I figure hey, they're cool people I get along with the girlfriend especially why not? Fast forward to when me and the guy are having sex later that night (I was drunk again) and the sex this time is incredibly painful. I'm not sure why really, but it literally felt like I was being rubbed raw. This went on for a long time. The entire sexual experience probably only lasted about an hour max but it seemed like it went on forever. I was whining, letting out painful moans, whimpering, but I never said stop or spoke up about how painful it was. I remember he was on top of me and my whole body was stiff as a board under him. I desperately tried to close my legs in a way so he couldn't penetrate me as deep or something but obviously nothing worked. At a couple points I would try to scooch away from him and he would keep pulling me back into him. I still never said anything, never said stop, never said no. It was like I had lost the ability to speak. It finally got to the point where he laid his whole body on me, pressing me into the bed with his entire weight in an effort to hold me still while he kept having sex with me. I was in so much pain and I could feel tears behind my eyes but I somehow managed to just let out a few pathetic whimpers while the rest of my body and mind just went numb. I remember desperately trying to just pretend like nothing was happening, like I was trying to send my mind somewhere else until he finished and it was over. He finally came and rolled off of me. We toweled off, both fell asleep, and then the next morning it was like nothing had happened between us. He acted normal as did I and again he handed me $200 as I left their apartment. I never spoke or heard from either him or his girlfriend again. For awhile I didn't think much about what happened at all. I thought of it just as a bad sexual experience until twice I was pinned down (once with my sexual partner while we were play fighting, and the second time at jiu jitsu practice) and I felt immediately triggered. I felt sick, like I was going to burst into tears, numb. And at first I didn't even realize why I felt that way! \n\n\nThis was almost 3 years ago now and to this day I've still never told anyone about what happened to me besides alluding that I had a bad experience/was assaulted. Since then I've had one other sexual encounter that was similar to what happened the first time but it wasn't nearly as bad. \n\nI just have a really hard time validating my experience. How can I recover or know that I've recovered when I don't even know what to call what happened to me? How do I know I've stopped being a victim when I don't even know whether I can call myself a victim to begin with? \n\nOver these last few years I've told myself that I'm \"over it\" and that it doesn't affect me, which is partially true. Most of the days I forget that it even happened to me. Today was not one of those days. I've felt incredibly guilty and ashamed and I don't even know why. I can't help but feel like I put myself into that situation, and for the longest time and even still, I have a hard time calling what happened to me \"rape\" or \"assault\". I just don't feel like what happened to me was \"as bad\" as what other victims have gone through. I really don't know how to feel about it. \n\n\nThank you all for reading/listening.",

    "text": "Female studying engineering with mental health issues, need some advice I've come to some cross roads in my life, and need some advice about what to next. (Sorry, it is quite long)\n\nHere's some background. I've completed a three year bachelor degree in engineering science and am now working on my masters in a specialist area in engineering. My long term goal was to always finish my masters and then work in industry. I got average marks in my undergrad and never really enjoyed university. The content was interesting, but I struggled keeping focus on class/study and had terrible time management problems. Was never a particularly happy individual with minimal friends but just accepted that to be my personality.  \n\nFast forward to one year into my masters. Pretty much have a nervous break down and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Drop out of some units and scrap a pass in others. I attend class sporadically and spend days at a time not leaving my room. Finally psychologist figures out I have adhd and now on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist (which is $700 for the first appointment alone..). I'm miserable, alone, and generally hate my life. I should be graduating, instead I'm 5 units short of graduating and haven't written my thesis (which will take a year). It's not that the content is overly difficult, it's just that the drive I once had is gone and I'm sick of student life/study.\n\nI've got some interviews lined up in technology consulting for fairly reputable companies. The pay is good, but not as good as whats offered in the area of engineering I studied. Family is pushing me to finish my masters, saying I will regret my decision not to complete my masters in the future. \n\nBut aside from my mental heath issues,  being a female in engineering is hard. At the university I attend, my specialist area has roughly 5% females. Even though I'm from my countries dominant ethnicity (white), most of my class mates are asian/indian. I don't have a cultural support group like many others. I don't really know if I want to work in this industry any more, and be subjected to what I have been put though in university. Any internships or awards I get are put down to me being female. In group projects I'm belittled and ignored. I've been asked if I understand first year content while being a masters student. \n\nSo simply... I just don't know what to do",

    "text": "Would anyone be willing to share their experience with an ARL program, especially in utah? Hi! I am from Utah, but I have worked in Japan the last 6 years (not teaching English) in Japan. Japan has been a good run for me but now I want to take my family and go back to Utah for a number of reasons. (Lower stress environment, better hours, but also I really love teaching.)\n\nMy father is a high school science teacher so I have always loved science and I have always kept myself very knowledgeable in science because I love it. But I don't have a degree in science nor do I have a teaching certificate. (My degree was Japanese Lang/Lit and Asian Studies)\n\nI am posting this here because I would really appreciate any information and experiences from anyone who has participated in an ARL (Alternative Routes to Licensure) program, especially in Utah.\n\nI especially think I am suited to be an earth sciences teacher and I am currently studying for the appropriate PRAXIS tests which I think I can easily pass after a few months of study.\nI could also easily teach a Japanese class, but I think there is no demand for that, and I would be much more excited about teaching Earth science anyway.\n\nUtah has a huge shortage of teachers, especially science teachers, so (as I gather) if you can get a good enough score on applicable PRAXIS tests you can get in an ARL program and become a teacher even if you don't have an applicable degree or teaching certificate.\n\nObviously living in Japan means I can't just walk on over to the BOA and get information easily. So I am trying to get as much information as I can now as I move forward trying to determine how and if I can manage this transition.\n\nLuckily, I can take PRAXIS tests here in Japan, so I am currently studying for those and hope to take one or two  before the end of the year as a sort of self-evaluation.\n\nI would be so greatful if someone out there who has gone through this sort of process would be willing to share their experiences with me.\n\nI am getting some information from my dad (who is a very successful chemistry teacher), but he mostly just says stuff like, \"I am *sure* you could do it. You are better than that bozo they hired last year. or \"You are so well suited to it.\" etc. But I really am having a hard time getting a good picture of how the overall flow of the system works, etc. The timeline of the whole process, when pay starts, how much support/training is offered, etc.\n\nThank you.",

I said I wasn't looking but it wouldn't hurt to go for the interview.\nI went to the interview with the mindset of \"nothing is gonna happen you're just doing this for the experience of going to an interview\" mind you, the interview is in the Central Valley of California. specifically [Modesto]. Anyways the interview ended up going really well and I actually kind of liked it. They sent me an offer letter the next morning.... stating they were still looking for candidates, but I was at the top of their list.\n[Project Manager Position] Base Salary only 5k more than what I'm making now, but offering additional 5k for relocation, monthly bonuses based off of company wide performance, and paid Overtime. the base salary wasn't enough for me to pull the trigger so I asked for 5k more... and that was like taking candy from a baby... They said \" for a candidate like you thats no problem at all...\" now that may not seem like much to some, but for a girl in her mid 20's trying to pay off her student loans and living in CA thats a good chunk. so overall the pay increase would be 10k (16% increase) + paid OT + monthly bonuses and 5k for relocation.\na little pre-story, I'm not from the Bay Area Originally, I'm from Michigan. I moved to CA for better job opportunity and the weather lol. I've been in the Bay Area for a little over a year and a half, and CA for over 3 years now.\nThe Bay Area is beautiful and I've made a good group of friends and really feel like I'm establishing myself. As far as the job itself goes, its a great opportunity for me for my career. Is the Move worth giving up everything? I hate to take personal items into factor, but is the opportunity greater than the crappy location? Do I let this opportunity go hoping something greater comes along somewhere down the line?",

I'm 29, American, about 4 years work experience.\n\nBachelors in Political Science, Masters in East Asian Studies, both from decent state schools, top 50. Grades were decent, 3.33 undergrad, 3.87 graduate, though they could have been better. Full time work and studies don't go so well together. All my academic studies were geopolitical and financial system focused, with an emphasis on China.\n\nAs part of the bachelor's and master's degrees, I spent 2 academic years in China. Then worked there in the education marketing field for a British company for another 2 years. From this, plus the academics, I speak fluent Mandarin, and have a strong understanding of Chinese culture.\n\nI came back to the US, and used my small savings to start a company. It had initial interest from some investors, which spurred me to really give it some serious thought, but the investments fell through and I poured my savings into it thinking if one investor showed interest, another must be interested as well. Didn't work out that way.\n\nAfter that folded, I spent 6 months or so scraping by and applying for jobs constantly, and fell bassackwards into a position. Initially I thought it was a short term consulting role where the owner of a small manufacturer in the Chicago region wanted me to accompany him as a \"spy\" on a business trip to China with him. Things sort of escalated quickly and I took a full time role as the China regional manager for this smallish company out in the boonies south of Chicago. I told him that this wasn't what I was looking to do longterm from the outset, and agreed to help him reform his businesses China operations. I spent one year doing this, found new dealers, renegotiated the contracts, fired the deadweight, stopped the dirt, redid the Chinese marketing materials, and hired on some long term talent to take over and trained them up.\n\nAfter one year, I shifted over to a part time position, as sort of an on call consultant, in addition to whatever else might be needed, because I was going to go back to school for economics. I did not, sadly, get accepted to the programs I applied for. I applied for \"Ivy League\" level European Universities, because I already have a master's degree, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense to get a second unless it comes with the networking potential of a top tier school. Thus I'm in a pickle. I have a year before the next intake for schools, with no guarantee again that I would even get in. I have rent to pay, and zero interest in continuing in my current job.\n\nI've been doing China, nearly exclusively, for almost 10 years now, and I need to branch out. It's lost it's allure, I don't enjoy it. I want to get into financial consulting, or management consulting or geopolitical analysis, or even journalism, something that is more generalized. I don't have anything against doing something that involves China in some way, but I do not want to do it exclusively anymore. I've been applying for Business Analyst, Financial Consultant, Global Strategy Analyst, Risk Analyst these types of positions, through LinkedIn in the Chicago area for many months now. I haven't had any responses though, can't seem to get through the HR filter. The only interview I had was in October, for an exclusively China focused position in Washington, for $43k a year which I didn't take. I'm not sure where to go from here...",

The tech part itself I have no interest in persuing, although I do like programming a lot. I've never completed any certification or education in it.I never tried to have a career in IT because I didn't want to, as a result my CV is filled with lies and omissions covering my lack of any specific skill and months and years of unemployment. I've been fired more times than I'd like to admit. Still I got hired again, I'd say because of my charm, intelligence and social skills. I used to work hard but nowadays only so far as to barely make the targets, I can't do it anymore.\nAt my current job (started 3 weeks ago) I'm anxious about being fired again (they already demoted me to a less demanding position), I keep myself calm and together, but it's a struggle while knowing my coworkers question my abilities. I try my best to learn all I can, but it doesn't seem enough to convince them.\n\nThe main issue is that I've been lying to myself for years, I've been ignoring my ARTISTIC calling. I'm a very talented photographer, painter and draftsman, but it's been hammered into me by my asian parents that... well you know the story. My ideal vision of myself is as a public figure who's a performer/artist/intellectual that people turn to for guidance and artistic inspiration. Ideally I'd live from my Art and change the world with my vision and spiritual message. The thing that keeps me going every day is my continuing exploration of my psyche, improving the things I don't like about myself and doing the things I like most (drawing, painting, sculpture, photography, playing guitar, building websites) it fills me with sense of accomplishment like nothing else. I can't see myself wasting away for the rest of my life in an office just to pay off a mortgage and support a family (don't have one fortunately).\n\nSo my passion is ART, to pay for my bills with something I actually like to do I've already been delving into webdevelopment (creativity + IT combined) for few years now but it's very hard work. I guess I like the IDEA of being a developer with good salary and working abroad on interesting projects, but the path to it is very long and demanding so I procrastinate a lot. I also fail romantically (no steady gf for a few years now) which worsens the anxiety I feel about my life, women my age don't like men who don't have a clear path in life or bitch about their current job too much. My finances are worse, being unemployed for weeks or months while jobhunting for a job I don't want to do but have to pay my growing bills, somehow I still manage and not starve. I don't want to live like this anymore !.  I need some fresh ideas, guidance, support, anything!",

    "text": "Should I report about racial stereotypes that go too far? Please i need advice? Hello cscareerquestions. Longtime lurker and finally made an account to complain about my possibly shitty situation. I just want readers to keep in mind and tell me in the end if I’m overreacting or am I actually being mistreated. I really want to believe I’m overreacting and I feel like I’m going crazy over this. \n\nTL:DR: I’m currently facing some less innocent stereotype jokes by an employee and I don’t know whether or not I should let it go or not.\n\nSo I work in an IT department that has a software team under a Canadian (Toronto area) company that does research. I am myself a young male Canadian-born Chinese who recently started my career as a software developer. Most of the stereotypes I’ve witnessed upon myself are very innocent and I play along and genuinely laugh. However, I have this one senior lead (who is White and from a commonwealth country other than Canada) and overall he’s a great guy and a great leader. He sometimes likes to use stereotypes a bit too much. A good amount of them time are innocent and I’ll play along or just not respond at all if they’re a bit more on the offensive (ex. Looking at a bunch of resumes and seeing a common last name like ‘Patel’ and saying hey that’s (another employee’s) brother)\n\nHowever, this one thing really got under my skin and prompted me to come here looking for advice. He wanted to know my “real” name and was being very persistent. I politely told him my parents gave me my western name first but it wasn’t enough for him. He even went to get other people to nag me about it who thankfully didn’t want to participate. He proceeded to try hard to annunciate his wife’s (who is also a Canadian born Chinese) and laughed. He’s a pescatarian who loves animals and loves to comment on a lot of the times when I’m eating something with meat and has also made some comments about me being a meat eater and being Asian. I feel like his wife just lets him have free reign on stereotypes but he should know not to have the same amicability to everyone else. That is probably what plays a huge part in his own mind that he can use Chinese stereotypes so frequently. My perception of him now makes me think he likes to make everything about my culture a joke and has somewhat of a superiority complex over i\n\nI really want to keep this job and has great benefits and a great pension and the other people I work with are just splendid. However, my contract ends in August with a chance to go on Full time with the benefits after that. My manager (who is also white) is a great teacher and mentor to me and the only thing he has ever asked me about my background is ‘What is your ethnicity’. My manager and I really get along and he knows I do a good job.\n\n However, I don’t know whether if I should make a complaint about this senior lead to my manager because what if he sees this as a nuisance to deal with a workplace problem that is related to racial sensitivity? The senior lead and manager are close professionally but not sure personally so I don’t know how to approach this. All I can think about is that if I make this complaint, am I going to be looked at as a problem? What if letting me go after my contract is the easier thing to do because I made this complaint? Does this also make me look bad if I’m trying to apply for another job and I say I complained about because of racial discrimination?\n\nSorry for the long post!",

    "text": "Career path for non-technical QA? Hi all, this is my first time posting in this sub, sorry if there are any formatting issues,\n\n\n#Backstory\n\n\nI'm a engineering graduate that happened to stumble into the QA industry a couple of years ago. I had basically no programming experience when studying my major (yes, my major happened to be one of those rare engineering stream where programming skills aren't really needed), aside from extremely simple VB.NET (think 'Hello World') as an elective.\n\nMy first job as QA was a manual tester in a small software vendor firm. Although the title was manual tester, I basically had to study specs and write my own test cases. The job involved mainly front-end testing dealing with clients, with occasional back-end testing using SQL to check DB values and entries (via simple SQL scripts).\n\nI currently work for the Asian branch of a pretty big international solutions provider. Job details here are more diverse and challenging:\n\n+ Take on as test lead in rotation with others for implementation of new product features (i.e. draft test plans and test cases)\n+ Communicate with other teams (PM, dev) to discuss deployment/roadmaps/timelines and corresponding feasibility\n+ Scheduling of manpower and resources for upcoming sprints (our company adopts some aspects of Agile)\n+ Identifying and proposing issues in overall software development workflow for improvements, but more emphasis on QA internal processes\n+ Manual test execution for front-end (client) and back-end (server) testing\n\nA bit about my current company and the working situation: the company started out with ~30ish employees, and has now grown to double the size thanks to booming revenues from Asian markets. QA head count, unfortunately, has been told will not increase accordingly. With increasing demand for faster response to market, our team is now facing a steadily increasing number of features under tighter deadlines. The fact that our products support desktop and mobile platforms does not help either. Even simple mobile device compatibility checking itself is a daunting task due to the variety of device/browser combinations out there on the market, with many more to come.\n\nStarting next month it's performance review, and my manager pulled me over early couple of days ago for a \"pre-meeting\". Basically he asked me what I felt I could learn or improve on (e.g. \"Any goals to improve yourself on?\"), and with a subtle hint that if I continue my performance in addition to these new skills/improvements that I might suggest, I could be a good candidate for a future promotion. I told him to give me a couple of days to think about these goals.\n\nIn private I have been trying to pickup programming (to prepare for automated testing), self-learning python from resources online. Unfortunately due to family commitments I can only reserve 3 - 4 hours per weekend to study. I personally doubt I can be sufficiently good in programming to be of any use at work. My company now already has a dedicated automation team to start developing frameworks and tools for us (especially to help with mobile device testing).\n\n#Question\n\n1. Coming from a non-technical background and history as a manual tester, what are some viable career paths in the QA domain that I could pursue? If any, what are some of the skills that I should pickup (which I'm lacking) or improve on? Please take into consideration that programming isn't something I'm good at.\n\n2. I do plan on leaving Asia and return to Canada in the future, are there any trends in QA for North America that is not yet evident in Asia that I should be aware of?\n\n3. I have yet to encounter any QA that is over the age of 45. Is this field something that prefers younger employees? If I want to continue pursuing a path in this field, is it possible to work until I retire?\n\nThat's all the questions I have for now, would appreciate any feedback. Thanks.",

I've lived in Vancouver Canada for a few years now, but I still often find it difficult to understand what people say.

I have 7 years of experience and I think the pay is not bad ($100k), but I'm not sure if that's reasonable amount or not. I feel like it would be difficult to advance in the company with my level of English. Manager roles would be a hard call. My improvement in English is quite slow and it doesn't look like it'll get any better in short time.

    "text": "Request for advice: taking on a 2nd job on top of my day job. I was hired as a data scientist for a large insurance company. Turns out, they actually have NO serious, long term projects going on. My management is constantly caught up in endless political games, have no technology background whatsoever, and seem incapable of building a serious tech team / product.\n\nMy day job now simply entails building very small scale toy projects once every few months, and aiding my managers in the politics by providing tech advise / material on demand.\n\nIn any case i have a hell of a lot of free time in the office, on the order of 95% of my work day.\n\nI have been thinking of using this time to work a second job. I can probably land a remote / contracting gig with a bay area company, and do the work in my office during the day. Is that a good idea?\n\nA few more details in case they matter: i am based in a first world Asian country (one of Japan / Hong Kong / Singapore), and am payed decently well in comparison to the local tech market (120k USD base). My employer is a very large, old school insurance firm. They require me to declare any other jobs / positions i hold, but i don't think this will be a problem. I do intend to declare it, but i don't think anyone will bother to ask details. In the unlikely event that they do, i'll say it's a corporation created for my dad / wife / sister's future business, and that i'm on it because of administrative reasons.\n\nDo you think this is a generally good idea? Are there any risks i am overlooking? Of course, I will never use my employer's equipment. My office is a satellite office, and therefore we are not usually logged into the corporate VPN. Financially, this can potentially be a great move for me - i am secretly dreaming of landing a 200k-ish gig.\n\nThanks for reading!",

    "text": "Are you stuck in accounting? Don't give up hope! Hey everyone, someone told me that I should share my story since it's quite unique. \n\nBackground: I'm 23, I'm Asian (yes minority classifications affect jobs), I graduated 2 years ago from a large state university with a degree in accountancy.\n\n I worked for almost 1 year as an auditor, 1 year as a advisory consultant, and now I just got an offer at an amazing consulting firm with a hefty pay raise and am making more than my audit senior did during his 5th year. My job is stable, I work half as much as an auditor at times, and I get more recognition.\n\nI entered the work force working in auditing. My job was very dull and tedious, and I hated it. It's just not the right thing for me. I know a lot of you love accounting, especially considering that I'm in the accounting subreddit, but I wanted something that was stable, had more income, had more flexibility, and was more fulfilling overall. \n\nI joined a Big 4 firm, and my office was not small. There were 50+ people in my start class for auditing. And in just 10 months, I transferred. \n\n---------\n\n**How I transferred**\n\nI didn't come in guns ablaze to HR or even my audit team. I didn't talk anyone to in audit. I approached a senior in my office's consulting team. I asked him about teams that had a need - a slot to fill. I got names - managers, directors, partners. I emailed every one of them and scheduled an interview/discussion. And I spoke with 5 people - a manager, two directors, a partner, and the senior. \n\nI asked them for a need. I promised I'd get my CPA (I did). I told them that I wanted to join. They were interested. They said they'll be glad to have me. It's so much easier when they're people in your firm. \n\nI talked to HR. HR contacted the partner, and the partner made it happen. I told my audit team, gave them 2 weeks notice. They didn't want to lose a cog-in-the-system associate, but they can't say no to a partner. Plus, I wanted to leave - it would benefit them to let me go. Keeping me would be even more detrimental, especially if I lost the motivation to do good work. \n\nThe switch happened within just 2 months. It was a bit dull, but overall amazing. I didn't get a pay raise. It was just advisory. I'm still called a consultant, but it was just advisory. Nonetheless, it began my journey into a new field of business.\n\n---------\n\n**How advisory worked for me**\n\nAdvisory was significantly better than audit. Most big 4's (and most other advisory wings) require the same thing: 40 hours a week with around extra time put into other works like proposals and development. Overall, it averaged about 45 hours per week. However, flexibility was far higher than audit. \n\nEvery consultant in the entire wing had at least one work-from-home day. It was also very common for people to request multiple WFH days during the week, so typically it's 2 days working from home. It was great, commute time was saved, and I felt far more comfortable. And no one expects you to be a machine at home either. \n\nMore importantly, I learned more - got more client exposure, got more deliverable/presentation experience, and became so much better at being a professional. Just by merely asking, I got put into almost-senior roles. And I was just a measly second year here. \n\n----------\n\n**The next offer** \n\nI thought I could do better. Plus I have a foot in the door of the consulting world now. But I also didn't want to work my ass off. MBB firms work you 60-90 hours a week. That's too much. I value my free time a LOT. \n\nI got an offer for another firm. Same work. More pay. Flexible. Acting senior role. Next year my pay will go up by 20% again. I'll be close to six figures, after just 3 years out of college. \n\n------------\n\nThese things might work for you. Or it might not. But one thing I have learned after all this: there are *always* opportunities and there's *always* a way into something better. You can get what you want as long as you make the connections and work for it. And no, I am not someone with a ton of connections that can get me in the door anywhere. I made those connections by just emailing people out of the blue. Start within your firm. Work your way out. Don't let nonresponses drag you down. If you're like me and hate audit, you can get out, and be far better off in every aspect.",

    "text": "Never Tolerate Disrespect Just Because She’s Powerful Several years ago, I was subjected to a level of disrespect from a fellow human being that I refused to let go unpunished. At the time, I was at a company weekend getaway that was held in a lavish resort. It was a glorified piss-up, and all expenses were paid by the corporate managers. On the second night the bar closed early, so we decided to go off in different groups throughout the resort, have more drinks, and enjoy the night. In the spirit of getting to know fellow members of the company from other branches, I went off to different groups and spent time with them. I was treated with respect by many of my fellow workers, and it turned out to be a great opportunity for networking. However, upon introducing myself to one group, I was treated with utter disrespect by one of the National Managers. She was a small Asian woman who was high on God-knows what, and drunk off her face. After I walked in and introduced myself to the others, she started screaming at me like an unstable maniac:\n\n\n\n\n“Who the fuck are you? Guys, seriously who the fuck is that in our room?! I’ve never seen him before – why the fuck is he looking at me? WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME?!!” she then screamed in an utterly abusive tone. One of the guys came up to me and apologetically suggested that I leave; explaining that she had had too much to drink. I was very disappointed that I didn’t get to meet more of my co-workers, and also that a National Manager had treated me in such a way. I refused to let this go down without a fight. \n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday I approached my boss and told her what had happened. She was outraged, and suggested that I make a formal complaint. The next day, I met up with the Deputy CEO and the General Manager of the company. I had no hope. Both of them were women, and they were on excellent terms with the National Manager who had abused me. According to them, the National Manager had a “natural charm”, and was “a lovely person” normally. Still, they got this unstable woman with a psychology degree to give me a call to apologize; which turned out to be very forced. I told that her that her behaviour had been unacceptable, and that the reason I had made a formal complaint was that I had been treated in such a way by a National Manager of all people. \n\n\n\n\nThree months later, I was out of the company, and the National Manager had been promoted.",

    "text": "Question / Idea for American feminists in the \"Women in Tech\" movement This question is mostly directed at American feminists, since in other countries, lack of representation of women in tech seems not to be as dramatic.\n\nI work in Silicon Valley, at a tech company, and the majority of my co-workers are of South Asian or East Asian descent. I would say about 75% of my co-workers are men, and 25% are women. Of the women, virtually 100% are of South Asian or East Asian descent (for the men, 80% are of South Asian or East Asian descent). Most of the men and women I work with are immigrants here in America on H1B visas (a controversial topic in its own right - which I won't bother debating here). FWIW, I was raised in the US, am a US citizen.\n\nIf the goal is to increase representation of women in tech,wouldn't the easiest way be to require a certain quota of H1B visas be allocated to women only? On my team, I have hired both men and women on H1Bs, and on average, I see absolutely no difference in their talent and abilities. I do, however, notice that I only ever seem to receive resumes from female engineers who are immigrants from East or South Asia, the majority of them on H1Bs.\n\nThe process of \"competing\" for one of the limited H1B visas is a difficult and arduous one for the technical talent that comes to this country. Often times, talented women engineers from other countries cannot get these visas. Wouldn't the most efficient way to increase the representation of women in tech be to require a high proportion of the H1Bs that are granted to foreign tech talent be given to women only? Is this something feminists should advocate for as an efficient way to improve the women in tech problems? If there was a requirement that H1B visas can only be given to women, there would be a large influx of female tech talent to this country, and technical roles in my company would almost immediately be at least 60% women.\n\nAsking as a curious manager at a Silicon Valley tech company who has hired and worked with many (90%+ foreign born) men and women, and has seen no difference in technical competence between the two genders.",

I changed my major from Asian Languages a year or two ago after realising I had only picked it because I didn't know what else to pick, and I'm one class away from completing my new major in Interactive Media - but I never completed any useful electives in this area as I'd already completed them in Asian Languages.\n\nI picked Interactive Media because I was interested in Virtual Reality specifically, and I still am and would love to work in the 'industry'. But, the VR industry is essentially the 3D Visualisation/Game Design industry and I'm only a beginner when it comes to creating game assets, and I can't code at all.

There were 50+ people in my start class for auditing. And in just 10 months, I transferred. \n\n---------\n\n**How I transferred**\n\nI didn't come in guns ablaze to HR or even my audit team. I didn't talk anyone to in audit. I approached a senior in my office's consulting team. I asked him about teams that had a need - a slot to fill. I got names - managers, directors, partners. I emailed every one of them and scheduled an interview/discussion. And I spoke with 5 people - a manager, two directors, a partner, and the senior. \n\nI asked them for a need. I promised I'd get my CPA (I did). I told them that I wanted to join. They were interested. They said they'll be glad to have me. It's so much easier when they're people in your firm. \n\nI talked to HR. HR contacted the partner, and the partner made it happen. I told my audit team, gave them 2 weeks notice. They didn't want to lose a cog-in-the-system associate, but they can't say no to a partner. Plus, I wanted to leave - it would benefit them to let me go. Keeping me would be even more detrimental, especially if I lost the motivation to do good work. \n\nThe switch happened within just 2 months. It was a bit dull, but overall amazing. I didn't get a pay raise. It was just advisory. I'm still called a consultant, but it was just advisory. Nonetheless, it began my journey into a new field of business.\n\n---------\n\n**How advisory worked for me**\n\nAdvisory was significantly better than audit. Most big 4's (and most other advisory wings) require the same thing: 40 hours a week with around extra time put into other works like proposals and development. Overall, it averaged about 45 hours per week. However, flexibility was far higher than audit. \n\nEvery consultant in the entire wing had at least one work-from-home day. It was also very common for people to request multiple WFH days during the week, so typically it's 2 days working from home. It was great, commute time was saved, and I felt far more comfortable. And no one expects you to be a machine at home either. \n\nMore importantly, I learned more - got more client exposure, got more deliverable/presentation experience, and became so much better at being a professional. Just by merely asking, I got put into almost-senior roles. And I was just a measly second year here. \n\n----------\n\n**The next offer** \n\nI thought I could do better. Plus I have a foot in the door of the consulting world now. But I also didn't want to work my ass off. MBB firms work you 60-90 hours a week. That's too much. I value my free time a LOT. \n\nI got an offer for another firm. Same work. More pay. Flexible. Acting senior role. Next year my pay will go up by 20% again. I'll be close to six figures, after just 3 years out of college. \n\n------------\n\nThese things might work for you. Or it might not. But one thing I have learned after all this: there are *always* opportunities and there's *always* a way into something better. You can get what you want as long as you make the connections and work for it. And no, I am not someone with a ton of connections that can get me in the door anywhere. I made those connections by just emailing people out of the blue. Start within your firm. Work your way out. Don't let nonresponses drag you down. If you're like me and hate audit, you can get out, and be far better off in every aspect.",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "ELLA - independent short film about Asian Americans in the midwest! Hey, my name is Douglas Kim, I'm a writer/producer living in Los Angeles.\n\nI'm producing a short film of a coming of age story that takes place in small town America.  The film follows the unlikely bond between Abe, a high school recluse and Ella, a charismatic college dropout, as they navigate the streets and social groups of their community.\n\nThe film features a notable Asian TV actor (Nichole Bloom of NBC's \"Superstore\"), offers a new setting for an Asian American story, and follows Asian characters who are integrated in their community, going through universal struggles while dealing with their outsider status in subtle but real ways.\n\nThe film will use an experimental, one-of-a-kind, camera rig that allows for a digital IMAX image.\n\nWith the success of Moonlight and other independent films, it's my belief that film is the way Asian Americans become normalized in America, where we can be seen as Americans pursuing our own version of the American dream.  I think we can accomplish that and more with our film.\n\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid\n\nWould love it if you can support and share our vision!\n\n\nmore from the director, Dan Chen:\n\nNichole Bloom and Dan Chen have been friends since they attended USC. After Nichole’s successful climb into American television, and Dan’s online awards for his short films (danchen.co), the two decided to collaborate once more on a character-driven project with the intention of festival recognition, online release, and a proof-of-concept for universal Asian American stories.\n\nDan, on the film’s story: “The underlying theme is one of “selling out,” as Abe distances himself from Ella to fit in with new kids he’s met. As an outsider, can he only fit in by submitting to the dominant views of his peers? Or is there a way he can stay loyal to his loved ones, without being left out of the larger community? The film’s story is character-driven and specific, but acts as a metaphor for the Asian American experience. Do we stay in our place, assimilate, or somehow find a third way of being?”\n\nThe camera rig was built by cinematographer Philips Shum, who has shot music videos featuring Diddy, Schoolboy Q, and Drake. It uses the principal of 35mm lens adapters, while increasing the size to accommodate a 56mm x 56mm frame, to create a low-budget solution for an IMAX field of view.\n\nElla is to be produced by Eric Cook and Douglas Kim with Evidence Films, Varient Entertainment, and Justice Tech Industries attached.",

    "text": "ADVICE - 1st yr teacher swore in front of students. I have a group of students who are so defiant, I get anxiety just thinking about supervising their study hall class. They call me names in Spanish, and when I call them out on it they tell me I have no proof because I don't speak Spanish. On Friday, things were going okay. I was having students color a piece of a Latino Heritage mural we were going to put up in the hallway. I played Selena on my computer. Kids were happy. I was happy. Things started spiraling when I started calling students out on foul language. Swearing is clearly not allowed, so after a warning which fell on deaf ears, I started logging infractions. The swearing continued. I'd circle the room, talking to students and helping them with the coloring key. As I'd come up to some table groups, they would give me this stare down and start speaking in Spanish yet again. No idea what they're saying, but it feels like it's inappropriately about me. I sit back down and the swearing continues. I tell my students that phone calls will be made home and start a list with examples of inappropriate behavior. THAT'S WHEN THINGS ESCALATED. I felt an immediate shift. Walked to the call button to ask the office for help. It wasn't working. I sat back down and texted my principal asking for her to come up because I was losing control of the class. She texted back saying she wasn't in the building and to contact the VP, whose number I did not have. I sat back down and continued writing. All of a sudden, a group of 7 students all got up and walked over to my table. They circled around me and started asking if they were on my list. They took my paper from me and started yelling \"I didn't say that!\" and \"You can't prove that!\". That's when it happened. I look at my paper getting passed around and crinkled. I reach for it and under my breath I say, \"Give me my f****** paper back.\" I was looking down at the table when I said it. They got me and they knew it. As soon as those words came out of my mouth, they walked away. They won. That's when the AP came in the room (Principal must have texted her), and told me to take a break. I explained what happened after the kids were dismissed. Made phone calls home. I am afraid of coming back tomorrow. I don't know what's going to happen.",

I go to a good university but I felt completely lost; I couldn't even declare a major since I was so indecisive.\n\nI've been doing a bit of soul searching and am trying to find out what interests me. Up until now I felt like I just always did my schoolwork and then hung out with friends and family, so I legitimately didn't feel like I had any interests. I wasn't particularly obsessed by any one topic either. I've been trying to read more and listen to podcasts, and open my mind a bit.\nAnyway, at this moment, I've managed to come up with a list of general topics of what I find interesting.  \n\n * **Healthcare:** The current plan is to go to medical school. But I'm interested in healthcare in a broader sense. I care about women's health in particular, so ob/gyn is a thought. I am Latina, so I care about helping bridge disparities in healthcare including language barriers for my community (others too, but I don't know enough about other communities).  \n \n * **Latino Issues:** I care about immigration policy. As I mentioned before I care about giving Latinos access to healthcare. A path to higher education. Mentoring for other Latinos to be aspiring physicians (if I decide to become a doctor). Getting more Latinos involved in politics and exercising their voting rights.    \n\n * **Education:** I've thought about becoming a teacher, but I don't know if this would be the right job for me. I'd maybe like to be involved in policy?  \n\n * **Others:** Finance, Tech, green jobs/environmentally friendly, non profits (big one), working in politics to help shape policy (maybe a think tank type of situation?).  I don't know if I would enjoy doing research, but I'm also interested in this (when I go back to school I'd be able to see if it would be something I enjoy)\n\nHopefully this post isn't too scattered. Anyway, thanks beforehand!",

    "text": "The real reason women are not represented in tech First, I want to clarify I do not agree with the basis that women are not biologically suitable for roles in tech. I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. \n\nLet's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. \n\nThis demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!\n\nBut why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.\n\nNerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.\n\nSo they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.\n\nCompare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.\n\nThis is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.\n\nUnless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

    "text": "There Are Only 23 Black Owned Banks Left in America > Black-Owned Banks Hit Their Peak a Century Ago \n\n> In late 19th and early 20th century, 57 black-owned charter banks entered the system\n\n> Black-owned banks arose and flourished in a period when African-Americans were kept out of other financial institutions, both overtly and through practices that effectively walled off their neighborhoods from other banks.\n\n> The sector hit a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when 57 black-owned banks and credit unions existed. \n\n> Six CEOs of black-owned banks locked themselves in a New Orleans conference room for more than a day in late 2016. Surrounded by papers, drawing boards and PowerPoints, the group strategized ways to reverse a trend 15 years in the making: the decline of their own banking sector.\n\n> The number of black-owned banks operating in the U.S. has been dropping steadily for the past 15 years and fell to 23 this year, the lowest level in recent history, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That has left many African-American communities short of access to capital and traditional financial services, according to some banking experts.\n\n> “We have a crisis among black banks,” said Doyle Mitchell, CEO of Washington-based Industrial Bank. “We met…to save the industry. To save ourselves.”\n\n> The 2008 recession hit the black banking sector especially hard, and if the current rate of closures of about two a year, as well as the industry-wide reluctance or inability to start banks, continues, black-owned banks could disappear entirely within the next eight to 12 years.\n\n> The trend is worrisome to some analysts who argue fewer banks serving low-income, minority groups could expand “financial deserts”—communities with few or no banking institutions—and increase the likelihood that black and Hispanic communities could become susceptible to redlining, a discriminatory practice that excludes poorer minority areas from financial services.\n\n> “These banks are banks that serve relatively poor neighborhoods,” said Russell Kashian, an economics professor who studies black-owned banks. “There are neighborhoods that if…the black-owned bank isn’t there, nobody is there.”\n\n> Most black-owned banks typically have a few branches in one city, although one of the category’s largest players, New Orleans-based Liberty Bank, has a multistate presence. Such banks comprise just a sliver of the overall U.S. financial sector, with collective assets of $5.5 billion, versus $16.3 trillion in the industry overall.\n\n> As a result, some economists question the significance of the sector’s decline. “Size-wise they’ve been small,” said Nicholas Lash, a business professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies minority banking. “So their total impact on black communities can’t be very, very large.”\n\n> Yet those who live in communities that have been served by black-owned banks say the impact there, both practical and psychological, is deeply felt. The most recent example is in Chicago, where Illinois state regulators in January closed Seaway Bank & Trust, determining that its financial health had so deteriorated that pumping in more money couldn’t save it.\n\n> “It was like air coming out of a balloon,” said Bob Fioretti, a former Chicago alderman who was previously involved in raising money to keep Seaway open. “People were deflated. Seaway was a standing icon of the community.”\n\n> Seaway, formerly Chicago’s largest black-owned bank, helped anchor the famed black business community on the city’s South Side.\n\n> Claire Adams, a former board president of a South Side Chicago housing community that was one of the first businesses to use Seaway when it opened in 1965, said she now fears that with fewer small, community banks in her part of the city, payday lenders and check-cashing institutions, which often charge exorbitant rates and fees, would be many African-Americans’ only nearby banking option.\n\n> “The only thing that’s left are these predatory institutions,” Ms. Adams said.\n\n> In some areas of the South Side, Seaway was the first bank some African-Americans had access to, making it a symbol of black enterprise and economic development, patrons say. Many speak of the bank with admiration, often mentioning a program that allowed children to open a bank account with a small amount of money.\n\n> “I [could go to] Chase or something…but I like Seaway,” said Nell Robinson, who has used Seaway for more than two decades. “Seaway was here before Chase. It’s a black bank [and], we have to pull our people up.”\n\n> With such concerns in mind, members of the South Side’s religious community raised more than $100,000 in deposits for Seaway in 2016. But the effort wasn’t enough. Seaway was sold to the State Bank of Texas, then sold again to North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union.\n\n> A prolonged period of low interest rates and intense competition, as bigger banks slowly move into underserved areas, have combined to contribute to the black banking sector’s decline, even after the recession’s end. Now a practical concern in Chicago and elsewhere is that, even if bigger institutions step in, they won’t be as accommodating in lending to black-owned businesses.\n\n> A survey of entrepreneurs by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014 found that 47% of black business owners had gotten the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites.\n\n> That survey also showed fear of rejection was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek needed capital at all.\n\n> “When I have an applicant that comes into my bank and comes into XYZ large bank, and they’re on the edges, there are things that I can understand and appreciate about their situation that XYZ large bank won’t, and that makes the difference,” Mr. Mitchell, of Industrial Bank, said.\n\nI feel like we have to do whatever we can to keep these financial institutions alive man. Some of these banks & credit unions have been serving us and our communities since before integration. No way we should let them down now by continuing to take our business to people who don't care about or respect us. \n\nI have an account w/ Industrial Bank here in DC which is black owned in fact it was my very first bank account ever. My parents are the reason for this, and I'm proud to say I still do business with them to this day.",

    "text": "[Rant] I saw disaster from a mile away and no one cared until now. I'm a first year 7th grade teacher, I teach a state history for my state. I love history, it was my major, and I wanted to be a teacher. I grew up with a teacher mother, surrounded myself with positive teacher role models, I knew this is what I should be doing. As a whole I like it a lot, I struggled some, especially in October, but I found a sort of balance and peace, have two amazing friends that are also new teacher who support me. \n\nPlus, I was pretty sure my administration team was a dream team. Except for a couple people, everyone is supportive, positive, cheerful, the principal is a rock star with so much to give and learn from. The APs are kind, effective, and there for you. I really feel like I got a sweet gig.\n\nMy team though, god my team. My team is made up of me, first year, one 2nd year teacher, one 3rd year teacher who spends all day wishing to be in a high school, and one veteran teacher who has 10 years experience but only 3 in our content. The reason she is in our content is because she was forced out of math to history because the district told the old principle at my school (never met her, was hired by the current one) to get her out of math.\n\nWe were basically non-functioning for half a year. I was struggling to teach myself a million things, because no one on my team was helping really - except the coworker who is on his second year but he is honestly still learning too. I was creating lessons the day of because our planning was miserable and not effective. We would meet four times a week and barely be two days ahead. \n\nIt was miserable, and our content specialist, who should be with us for one planning a week and guiding us was no where to be found. Her attention was stretched between 8th grade which is a state testing year, because the team was ALL brand new to the school and two were new teachers, and 6th grade competed with us for her attention because we both had the same planning period. Then if none of that was in the way administration had her in meetings, or she was out for district stuff.\n\nI spent ALL of my first semester begging for more support for my team. Begging for our content leader to be in plannings, going to the principal and telling him issues with the most \"veteran\" member of our team. (A whole rant on its own, but basically has only the obsession to get back into math, in another district, makes casual racists comments in a Title One highly hispanic school on the regular, and is very abrasive and pig headed and refuses to listen). \n\nI begged someone to come observe me for some feedback, I begged for support with my 'bubble' kids who were on the edge of passing. I think I spent more time after school trying to get advice, trying to get someone to come help our barely floating teams planning, TRYING to get something fixed. Planning only got better only because I took over keeping track of who said what and what were planing to do in a google doc and not letting our 'veteran' teacher control the planning by moving it to my room and pulling up a week and making us pound it out and look for resources. We just now have successful plannings half way through the year and I was the one who had to do it (with help of my two co workers to guide me).\n\nWell today we found out we had the lowest scores in the district on our district monitoring tests we have to give twice a semester. Suddenly we are now being observed once a week, have multiple meetings a month, must have someone in planning with us at all times, must stay after school once a week for 'lesson plan flow training', must have special bubble kid tutoring on another day of the week. Must use specially designed warm ups based off of the tests questions they see that we had access too ALL YEAR apparently along with the packets for the kids but NO ONE EVER TOLD ME ABOUT!! I would have been doing those in a heart beat to save myself time creating warm ups!\n\nI am mad, I am mad, and frustrated. Mad that my kids did so poorly and wondering how I failed them, wondering why this happened. I am mad that my team is barely functioning, and that I had to get us on track when I begged for help. Mad that I have been knocking on peoples doors for months asking for feedback, asking to talk to someone, asking for support with exit tickets and warm ups and my content leader never being around. Mad that our content is poorly supported with little resources and little to guide us so we are digging around on our own with ancient artifacts from the 80s and 90s and the internet as our only resources. \n\nI will take this as a lesson, I will soak up every minute of those extra meetings and extra plannings. I will needle every person who walks into the room so that I will never be put in the situation of begging for help but being ignored until the numbers come back and suddenly it matters again.\n\nI find myself disillusioned with the admin team I was proud of. I still think they are solid, but they did not listen to me when I pointed out the boiling pot until it boiled over and that frustrates me. I am so very aware now of how little people think of my content, because there is no state test.",

    "text": "Not sure how frustrated to be. Is it my inexperience or my strange/terrible situation. As always, long rant warning.\n\n\nAfter two years of teaching elementary as a leave replacement I finally got a tenure track job. It was teaching 7th grade social studies in an urban district. I had only taught suburban before but I knew my skills as a teacher and felt while it would be challenging it was ultimately something I could handle. \n\n\nWhich I am, although barely. There were a lot of things that were kept from me when I was interviewing that have made things more difficult for me as a teacher. And I know despite teaching before, the new age group/subject/population type basically makes me a new teacher so yes, I'm going to struggle. And I feel ridiculous saying I have a good excuse for struggling but I feel like my current situation isn't helping and maybe I have an excuse.\n\n\nI will be moving into a new building that will be beautiful and have all the space, supplies and technology I would ever need. Until then I am sharing a room with another 7th grade teacher who has taught there for years. The room is not small but split in half each \"technical\" room is small. We put up a bunch of file cabinets to create some division but at the end of the day the two classes hear each other all day. Which means no matter what, what I do is being observed by the other teacher and the other class. It's like being in an observation all day, every day and it unnerves me so much. It's one thing to struggle but another thing to struggle and have a constant audience of it.  We were first supposed to move in October, then it was January and I have a feel they are going to push the move-in date later again.\n\n\n-This grade level is the toughest and meanest they had in years and includes a student who was pulled out last year to go in a alternate program for severe behavior issues. They closed to program this year and he was put back into regular ed. He was fine for the first month but then it got bad. He's been cursing, rapping in class, walking around the room, trying to start pretend fights and not listening to any directions.  I'm following procedure on how to handle him (writing up, detention, parent meetings, behavior charts) and have been praised on how I am handling it all and have been told at the end of the day he's choosing not to listen and there is not much else I can do. But when I am dealing with him or any other student not listening, the other class hears and they do hold it against me. One of my difficult students has told me because my 10th period is so bad why should I be so hard on their class for being bad and loud as well. \"You don't do anything with them if they don't listen\". Which believe me I do, but he doesn't see that and it affects how the students see and react to me. I'm also never alone as they other teachers have specials in their classes during prep so they are with my for almost the entire prep/lunch period.\n\n\nWe cannot make drastic changes of the room since we are supposed to move. I didn't have a white board for four weeks. I had a find an old one that was about 4x2 feet and teach with that. I don't have a smart board or projector either. They did have extras but they were given to other teachers in my grade level since they are tested subjects. We are are a 1:1 school but didn't get the actual chromebooks for about four weeks as well. It does help but since I can't display anything I have to upload everything to googleclassroom (which I do love and has helped so much) but I have to rely on the students to not play games or surf the internet. And youtube is blocked so resources I would have normally used cannot be used anymore until we move.\n\n\n-Then three months in they switched what side of the room I taught on. They gave me two days notice. In theory, I'm fine with switching because the other teacher teaches science and needs room to do labs. But this side was half the size of my first side. I can fit five tables, my desk and the chrome book cart but there is so little space otherwise. All of the students are on top of each other and no matter how I change seats they are always close and it's like wherever I place them doesn't matter. I feel like no matter how much I have tried to reinforce procedure despite the switch the switch has affected the students and they have gotten worse.\n\n\n-Teaching procedures in general. I know the importance of it and had all these ideas of what I wanted to do to start the year but with the constant changes in my classroom situation made it impossible to have structure and consistency. I kept having to change to basic procedures of the class as the changes kept happening. \n\n\n-And as an untested subject I don't have any help. The ELA/Math teachers have special education teachers and bilingual teachers push-in as the school is over 90% hispanic and we all have two classes with bilingual students (half of those with speak and understand little to no english) and the bilingual students who speak the best get pulled out of my class halfway through for ESL One of those classes is also considered billingual/sped. . So it's the usual the usual IEP's and 504's as well as students from the self-contained class who are mainstreamed for SS/Science for the social aspect. In theory, I totally get it and normally would just make it work but after all this it all just adds to my frustration.\n\n\nI'm a hard worker and understand that sometimes you have to roll with changes but I can't handle all of these changes anymore. It's constant and I feel like I can't find my footing. It's tough being a new teacher already but adding all these other things has been me an anxious overworked mess who for the first time dreads going to work. I have cried more in this job in front of coworkers/admit than in the past 5 years. The teacher that I share with is now annoyed when I lose control of classes and with her own tough past (long story) has very little sympathy whenever I struggle or have gotten upset.I feel for her because I can't imagine how tough it is to teach with noise like that and have apologized but I was told sorry wasn't good enough anymore. I've been told by her, other teachers and my mentor to just deal with it, not to be upset/cry and by this point I should be making it work. Which I basically am. Almost all of my students are passing (except the lazy ones who are failing everything) and was told by my principal and mentor that if I was doing as bad as I feel I am I would have been called in, replaced or moved. But I still feel so awful and after all these mixed messages I don't know what to feel.\n\n\nAm I making excuses? Whining too much? Or do I have a reason to be frustrated/struggling as much as I feel I am? HELP ME FIGURE THIS OUT.",

    "text": "Surprise After Signing Contract I spent yesterday in my new school district (about 40 minutes away from home) after signing my new contract for next school year in the district office then going to my school to observe. I'll be teaching high school history. My new school is title 1 in a rural area. One of the principal's focuses for next year is global experience / diversity, which is why he hired me (I am first year technically but taught abroad). \n\nI was there just for the day, but ate lunch in the staff room (rookie mistake, I know). At lunch, one of the other teachers brought up a student who is Russian and an English language learner--one of the first non-Hispanic ELLs in the school, ever, I presume. The teachers basically talked about how they didn't know how to differentiate for her--OK, not everyone has that training. Then, they proceeded to make fun of her accent and speculating whether her mother was a mail-order bride.\n\nI might be too much of a snowflake, but I'm horrified that I'll be calling these teachers my \"colleagues\" next year. I still haven't cancelled my other interview offers, and would seriously consider a break of contract before the year begins to join another district at this point. Am I overreacting? What are my options?\n\nTLDR... new teacher, visiting school. Other teachers made fun of student and her mother in front of me at lunch.",

I don't have a college degree, so most of the jobs I apply for are delivery jobs, production/warehouse, food service. For interviews, I wear nice dress pants, appropriate shirt depending on the job, and I comb my hair and make it look as nice as possible, but I still let it be free and don't do buns.\n\nI've gotten some food service jobs like this without a problem. They just make me wear a hat. Most people who have these jobs are artists/weirdos like me so they understand that.\n\nI didn't get a job packaging chocolates, even though my phone interview went really well, and so did my in person interview. I suspect it was also because it was 99% white women working there (like +20 of them), and because she asked me what my race was when I was leaving (I'm hispanic).\n\nI also blew a barista interview. We only sat down for like 3 minutes. I became self-conscious and quiet and couldn't think of things to say. The reason for this is because it was a tiny coffee shop and there were customers RIGHT next to me.\n\nI also didn't get a job packing joints even though my interview went really well. It's a super simple job, so my self-esteem and wallet are crying.\n\nAfter a lot of failed attempts I'm starting to feel self-conscious about my race, and I suspect that a lot of people are racist but I'm not sure if that's the reason. Maybe it's the hair! Ha. I've only lived in this city for a year by the way. I had no problem getting jobs in Seattle. My accent is barely noticable and I communicate clearly.\n\nMy resume could be better, but I was a lead driver in my last job, in charge of giving orientations, hiring, and supervising. The rest of my resume is from working at Starbucks, and another coffee shop from when I moved. I also include that I am self-employed at the very top, but I'm a struggling web developer (learning) so my only clients are family that are patient with me. Should I take that out? I did have one pizza place that liked that I made money on the side, but unfortunately I had to quit that job because that same manager had a mental breakdown and my training was awful so I quit.\n\nI'm getting brand ambassador / marketing experience lately from working at events 2-3 times a month, so I should add that to my resume too, and maybe I can get a job related to that field.\n\nAnyway, I know it's hard to pinpoint why I can't get a job, and now the hair thing seems irrelevant, but maybe I should cut it.

    "text": "Xenophobic-ish comments from a minority patient . Not sure how to feel about this. Background: I work in a city hospital that serves a very impoverished minority population . Our Institution isn't exactly stellar  , so except for Radiology and Surgery most of our residents and staff are FMGs or IMGs.  Me (FMG) and my posse ( Mostly FMGs)were doing our rounds. Being a Sunday , out team was providing cross-coverage and we had a lot of patients to round on. \n\nWe make to the ED to examine a patient who had come in with shortness of breath and  diagnosed with a PE. The patient was a black transgender patient. She had been in the ED for a couple of hours \n\nThe moment I stepped in the room my spidey-sense started tingling. Started off rough enough \" who are you ? why Are you here ? Why are  you rounding so late?.I'm short of breath\" ( while screaming at the top of her lungs).  Ma'am . I had 30 patients. i needed to prioritize , but you have my attention now . \n\nShe explained that she was basically ignored by the nurse ( which was true - was not hooked up to telemetry or SO2 monitoring ).\nI apologized to her and told her I would talk to the nurse and that she should take it up the charge nurse. So far nothing usual. \nThen she went off on a tirade  .\" My mother worked in this hospital ,I also worked in healthcare . Used to come here sometimes until I started getting my care in  *Brand name * Hospital . This hospital was  much better run when we had Real American Doctors, not all these foreign doctors.\" She repeats this stament verbatim again during the course of the encounter. \n\nNow my interns and resident are visibly disturbed. But she goes on . About how her usual hospital is much better.  I then remind her BTW, I'm also foreign ( my phenotypic  ethnicity is ambiguous- on a good day I can pass off for Hispanic/Italian . I was called \" white trash \" once ).\n\nIn order to diffuse the situation , I agree with all her comments. I  put in a few negative comments about my own hospital( I find this works very  well to calm down a an angry patient/family )  This eventually calms her down , and I manage to get a coherent history and physical exam.\n \nBy the end of the encounter I tell her \" Ma'am, I'm sorry you couldn't get a real american doctor today \". She then suddenly becomes apologetic.  \"Oh, I didn't  mean all foreign doctors are bad . Just like the cops you have good ones and bad ones  . You all have been very professional . \"\n\nI shake her hand and the encounter ends.\n\nI don't know how to feel about all this. My training tells me that the outburst was probably a reaction to the stress of being in a hospital and mistreatment by the ED nurse. She did apologize in the end ( cant vouch for the sincerity of it  though ) . She herself belongs to a very marginalized group ( Black M-to-F transgender ) but had no qualms or second thoughts about espousing xenophobic comments.  \n\n Throughout  my training I've been on the receiving end of irate patients .But this encounter left an especially bad taste in my mouth. I guess the fear of \"the others \" is a very primal urge. And all these civilities are just veneers on a underlying tribal  mindset. \n\nAt least I can watch the WWE Summer Slam tonight and get my mind off this .\n\nAnyone else here had similar experiences ? How would you debrief your residents/interns ?",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "I’m in old school trouble. Pregnant and no idea what to do. Send me some advice!! I’m so deep in the shit if I don’t find a box to stand on soon, it’s going to be over my head and I’ll be swimming. Maybe writing it down and posting anonymously on Reddit will help. \n\n\nHere are my problems in the order of how fucked I am:\n\nProblem 1. I am 25 weeks pregnant and nobody knows, except for everyone I see or talk to or try to walk past a little too close. They all know, because I am the size of a dumper truck. They all say ‘wow you’re getting big’ or ‘your parents must be so excited’. They’re not, because I haven’t been back to Kolkata since April, and they don’t fucking know. \n\n\nProblem 2. When my ultra conservative Indian parents find out I am pregnant, they will immediately:\n\n\n1. Come to England\n\n2. Kill me\n\n3. Find out who the father is (actually, this would be quite useful), if necessary by DNA testing the whole of London \n\n4. Kill him\n\n5. Drag my twitching corpse back to India and force me to marry some fucking annoying Indian guy with awful taste in shirts. \n\n6. Bring up the baby themselves while I finish my degree literally shackled to a desk, to ensure I can’t bring any more great shame on the family. \n\n\nProblem 3. Oh yeah, did I mention. I don’t know who the father is. Ok there’s only two possibilities! Don’t judge me - I’m a student and we have sex sometimes. I just happened to get very lucky twice in one week. And if you’re thinking how irresponsible it was not to take precautions, I fucking did, ok. We used condoms, but we were drunk and I guess something leaked past. Now stop going on about it. I have waddled past both guys around campus a few times, but neither has stopped me to say ‘hi’ or ‘how are you’ or ‘fuck, you’re pregnant, it’s not mine is it?’. They are both blissfully ignorant of their impending fate. \n\n\nProblem 4. Since about week 23 my sex drive has got batshit crazy, but because I look like a waddling Indian whale no guy wants to have sex with me probably because they’re worried if they get too close they’ll fall over my gravitational event horizon and be unable to escape. This is a shame because my tits look amazing, and nobody is getting to admire them. \n\n\nProblem 5. I have zero idea what I’m going to do after the baby is born. I’m a fourth year medical student. I have made absolutely no plans. My medical training so far tells me that in about 15 weeks a baby is going to pop out of my vagina and probably want some attention. What am I doing to do? I haven’t the first idea. Take a year off studying? Give baby for adoption? Sell it on eBay? My rating isn’t that great - I once sold a guy a broken hoover. Could be a problem. \n\n\nI know I know I need to grow up, face reality and get a grip. Here is my plan:\n\n\n1. Find out who the father is. I’m going to have to ask them both to do paternity tests. That’ll be fun. \n\n2. Have sex with him. (Wishful thinking, probably.)\n\n3. Find out whether he wants to be a father. Because loads of undergraduate student guys are just itching to become dads, right? Probably should also warn him that my parents will murder him, definitely, and that he might want to buy a disguise. \n\n4. Tell my parents that despite obviously being a virgin, I have somehow become pregnant. \n\n5. Go into hiding. \n\nI don’t really need advice. I know what I have to do. But somebody send me some solidarity! Everyone assumes I have this impending situation totally under control, whereas in reality I’ve just been pretending it isn’t going to happen! If you’ve been in this boat, send me a PM and we can be friends!!",

    "text": "I was slut shamed as a kid in high school. Sometimes it really bothers me. I need to vent. Well, I am Indian. I am 19 now. When I was 15, I was made to stand up in class, and called a slut in front of everyone by a male teacher just because I was tom-boyish and had way more male friends than female ones. \n\nThat teacher had discussed my “slutiness” with other teachers in the school and they all had the same mentality, so I was looked at by all teacher the same way as Hester Prynne and had an invisible red “S” letter around my neck. They all antagonized me just because of my tom-boyish nature and thought of me as a slut. I was outspoken, they did not like that either. That just added to my shameless slutty nature. \n\nI had no friends. No one at school would even look at me or talk to me. I couldn't ask the teachers for any help. They wouldn't. They wouldn't let me participate in competitions, since I would bring shame to the school with my slutty nature. They'd make me sit in the last bench all by myself. \n\nI was punished way more harshly for meager mistakes than any other kid. I'd have a note written to my parents, or I'd be made to stand in class and listen to the teacher go on and on about character. \n\nMy studies suffered. The last year in the school, in 10th grade, I was sick asf. Missed 7 months. When I came back, I did not get any help from any teacher. I had missed out a lot, and the teachers wouldn't help me with anything. I took supplemental classes and covered up about 200 chapters in 3 months. I gave my exam, i was confident of scoring atleast 75/80 in every subject. \n\nThen the results came. The written paper was external assessment of 80 marks, which was only student dependent. The internal assessment of 20 marks, entirely depended on the teachers. This was a matriculation certificate examination. It had some great value. Turns out, I'd scored about 75 in every subject. Give or take 2 marks. The teachers gave me 5/20 on the internal, on every subject. I ended up with an 83 percent instead of a 95. \n\nI don't even care about the names they called me or how they judged me. I had to cover 200 chapters in 3 months. I cannot begin to tell you how much hardwork and labour it took. And I managed to do well, regardless of my circumstances but they intentionally brought me down with the internal. Even when they knew I needed those marks like crazy. \n\nIt's like they had developed something personal against me for talking to the boys in my class. My hard work didn't matter much in the end. I worked so hard so that I could give the KVPY, a national level science exam for getting a seat in the top research institute in the country. I didn't qualify as my score was below the qualification cut off. \n\nWell done, teachers. \n\nEdit: that kind of behavior on the teachers' part had started when I was 13. It reached it's peak when I was 15. I never realized why the teachers didn't like me even though I was a sincere student and scored well. \n\nThe teacher who called me a slut, used to call my friends into his office and ask them to not talk to me. Since I was a \"bad influence\". If they didn't listen, he'd tell the same to their parents in PTA meetings, and the parents believing a teacher, would make their kids not talk to me. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the supportive comments, Reddit! Really appreciate it.",

    "text": "Help! My father(55m) has thrown me(26f) out of his house. This is going to be so messed up. I apologize in advance. Plz give me some guidance.\n\nMy father is a very strict, controlling, retired military man. He is a narcissist. He has verbally, emotionally and physically abused my mother since they got married, to the point that she is bed-ridden, dying, completely brainwashed and absolutely dependant on him for everything. She is not allowed to have opinions of her own, she gets screamed at mercilessly and even hit at when she was younger. She is a shell, just nothing left inside. Due to her extreme illness, her mind has regressed to a childlike state. \n\nHe has been the same with us. We had a thousand rules in my house. I grew up thinking a father who screamed at you for wearing skinny jeans or finding out your secret stash of shampoo packets or forcing you to eat the dirt you left on the floor was normal. That it was OK that he threatened to shoot my ex boyfriend when he found out I was dating, and no, he wasn't being funny. That having a 5 minute timer to use loo or he would start beating on the door was fine. Talking to any boy was forbidden. Being scolded in public, called a ugly man, mocked for having small breasts. He called me ugly, useless, a whore, dumb, a disappointment, worse than trash, a bad daughter again and again. He forbade me to seek treatment for depression, thought I was just weak. I can go on for hours. He is always right, he can never bend or accept he is wrong, he would rather die even if it's him against the entire world. As a kid, he used to beat me mercilessly for things like me reading Harry Potter books or comics. I got my knuckles crushed with pencils for eating chips. I was always the school topper.\n\nFor context, I am a doctor, I am doing my masters in anaesthesia. I left home years ago for studying. A breath of fresh air. I hated going back to home. Environment of despair and anger and screaming, sad parents. A year ago I fell in love madly with someone who is more or less perfect. Told my parents, my father told me point blank it's boyfriend or my family. He was forcing me to marry a family friend's son within next months. I refused to do so and he threw me out of his house. The reason for his refusal was that my boyfriend isn't a doctor and comes from a well to do family and it would really kill my father and damage his ego to have a richer and more powerful in-laws. He told me he would forever feel like a small man. The end. Hasn't talked with me in 10 months, hasn't let me visit home, won't let my mum talk to me, worse, my mum also hates me now for marrying someone they don't like. \n\nI am on my own. I am in an expensive graduate program. I don't earn much. My father has cut me off legally too. My wonderful boyfriend's family has adopted me, they love me. My boyfriend helps me out financially. Problem? I miss my family. I love my father. I know I have painted a bad picture of him here, but he has sacrificed a lot for me too and has had a hard life. Taking care of my mum is very difficult. I miss my mum. My dad won't let me talk to or meet her. I carry a lot of guilt and shame inside me for abandoning my parents. I live in a very conservative country (India). Most of the people here who know about my relationship judge me for leaving my parents, mostly cuz they don't know the whole story. I keep things mostly to myself, but at times I want to scream out I did all I could. I feel lost. Every step at reconciliation has failed. My father has fought and cut contact with all relatives and friends. There is no one left who can try to advise him, no one he will even listen to.\n\nCouple of months ago, I took a break from my relationship to try to work things out with my parents. I was extremely depressed and dying with guilt. My father told me to commit suicide for all he cares, just not to contact him for funeral charges. So yeah, at this point, if I die, I don't think he will actually care. He has also told my future in laws that I am a horrible, cursed person who will destroy their family. \n\nMy boyfriend hates my father. I don't blame him. We are getting engaged soon. I feel like all bridges have been burnt. I miss my family. They are struggling, getting older, mum is frequently sick. I wish they saw I am happy with this new wonderful family. My parents had such an unhappy marriage, yet they were forcing me to marry a stranger who was creepy and so much older. My father has accepted that my boyfriend is a good man, but he couldn't accept that I found someone I love. In Indian culture, for so many families love marriages are taboo. What do I do? \n\nTl;Dr : I left my home due to falling in love. How do I stop feeling like a terrible daughter and person?",

    "text": "Dating question (possibly controversial) Throwaway because I know it's a bad attitude to have and the post may seem inflammatory, but I can't talk about this to my girl friends and I wonder if it's ever happened/currently happens to other black ladies.\n\n\nDo you or did you in the past refuse to date black men as a knee-jerk reaction to them taking us for granted, especially if we're dark skinned? Growing up, I was made fun of, ignored or overlooked by my fellow black classmates and the only boys who had anything nice to say about me were either mixed with a black mom or born of mixed parents themselves or not black at all.\n\n\nIn college, black guys finally seemed interested but only because they had noticed men of other races being interested in me. Some good black male friends of mine acknowledged that this was true, too. I didn't like that at all, it felt like I was only good if I was vetted by other races of men. Deep down, they weren't really attracted to me, they still thought I was inferior for being darkskinned and black (the same rules didn't apply to dark Indian or South East Asian women of course) but thought that surely, I couldn't be this ugly if I was popular with men of \"better\" races (according to them). Combined with seeing everywhere black men worshipping non black women (or playing the \"I have no preference\" card when literally every other race of men prefers their own) in general in the media as well as in my life, I immediately judge any black guy who shows interest in me and know from the beginning I won't date them. I feel like I'm \"sloppy seconds\" and the second a(nother) non-black (or mixed/light skinned) woman comes along, I'm gonna be dumped like hot coffee. It overrides their looks and personality, however pleasing they may be.\n\n\nI also don't want to reinforce their notion that dark black women will always be there and that they can always fall back on us and be welcomed with open arms, no matter how dismissive they've been on us beforehand.\n\n\nNow, I know that it's somewhat unfair to paint all black guys with such a brush. That's why I'm posting. I don't have problems with dating at all otherwise, but I know such thinking is problematic and wonder if other women have been in similar situations.",

    "text": "Ontological Commitments, Sex and Gender, by Mari Mikkola Excerpt from \"Feminist Metaphysics - Explorations in the Ontology of Sex, Gender and the Self\", edited by Charlotte Witt.\n\n***\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis chapter develops an alternative for (what feminists call) “the sex/gender distinction”. I do so in order to avoid certain problematic implications the distinction underpins. First, the sex/gender distinction paradigmatically holds that some social conditions determine one’s gender (whether one is a woman or a man), and that some biological conditions determine one’s sex (whether one is female or male). Further, sex and gender come apart. Taking gender as socially constructed, this implies that women exist mind-dependently, or due to productive human social activities; thus, it should be possible to do away with them just by altering the social conditions on which gender depends. In addition, some feminists take gender to depend on oppressive social conditions. Changing our social environments, then, would not only unwittingly eradicate women; doing away with women should be feminism’s political goal. I argue that both implications are unacceptable. In response, I argue for a view that is more congenial to ordinary thinking and that doesn’t have the goal of eradicating women.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis chapter develops a model, which I will call “the trait/norm covariance model”, as an alternative for understanding the phenomena feminists usually discuss under the rubric of the sex/gender distinction. This well-known distinction gives rise to certain problems that motivate the formulation of my alternative model. Specifically, I have in mind here problems arising from the conventionalist and abolitionist implications that the distinction underpins. First, consider the conventionalist implications: paradigmatically, some social conditions must be met in order for one to count as a woman or a man because gender is (as the slogan goes) socially constructed. One need not satisfy any biological or anatomical conditions; they are relevant only for counting as female or male. On this understanding “woman” and “man” are used as gender terms, “female” and “male” as sex terms.  The implication is that women and men exist mind-dependently or due to productive human social activities: that there are women and men ontologically depends on some social institutions and agents, their beliefs, practices and/or conventions in that women and men could not exist unless the relevant institutions, practices and conventions (with conscious agents upholding them) existed. Women and men are akin to wives, husbands and US senators that also depend on us for their existence.  This being so, it should be possible to do away with women and men while leaving the individuals we call “women” and “men” otherwise intact–we simply alter those social conditions on which gender depends so that individuals no longer count as women and men. Consider a parallel to US senators: their existence depends on certain sociopolitical conventions so that were a political revolution to alter those conventions by abolishing the US Senate, US senators would literally vanish overnight. Those individuals who previously counted as US senators would no longer do so despite being otherwise physically intact (presuming the revolution were a bloodless one). Just as one need not execute US senators in order to eradicate them, the thought is, eradicating women and men does not require physically altering those individuals we think of as women and men. Second, consider the abolitionist implication: in addition to holding a conventionalist view, some feminists take gender to depend ontologically on oppressive social conditions. As a result, changing our social environments would not only unwittingly eradicate women and men: doing away with gender should be feminism’s political goal.  \n\n\nAs I see it, both implications are problematic and ones that many ordinary social agents are unwilling to accept. Ordinarily, women are thought to be human females, men human males. As a result, their existence is not thought to depend on productive human social conventions, practices and institutions so that we could abolish women and men leaving intact females and males simply by altering our social landscapes. Conventionalist implications, then, are unintuitive. Further, ordinary social agents often find the abolitionist implication that “after the revolution” women and men will no longer exist objectionable. Many of my students, along with other feminist philosophers, do not see being a woman or a man as problematic per se. Rather, the problem is how we are viewed and treated as women and men. For ordinary thinking, then, the idea that feminists should aim to do away with women and men harbors undesirable ontological commitments.\n\nThese problems are generated by a clash between the paradigmatic feminist and everyday conceptions of sex and gender. Ordinary thinking does not separate sex and gender in the way many feminists do, thus neither seeing the existence of women and men as mind-dependent nor holding that gender is something to be eradicated. We can avoid this clash in one of two ways: either feminists work hard to modify everyday conceptions of sex and gender so that they are in line with the conventionalist and abolitionist views, or feminists modify their conceptions of sex and gender so that they are closer to everyday thinking. Here I will endorse the latter option and propose a way to conceptualize the phenomena usually discussed under the sex/gender distinction to avoid the unintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments. I will do so by developing what I will call “the trait/norm covariance model” to replace the usual sex/gender distinction. My alternative model will involve redrawing the boundaries of the sets of gender and sex traits and dividing these traits into new sets: descriptive traits (traits of which there is “a fact of the matter”) and evaluative norms (norms that express judgments about descriptive traits). For instance, the paradigmatic gender trait of wearing make-up and the paradigmatic sex trait of having ovaries will both count as descriptive traits (one either has ovaries/regularly wears make-up or not). But, my model also acknowledges the influence of social norms: certain evaluations (like being judged to act, be or appear “feminine”) can be seen to covary with particular descriptive traits, which accounts for why some traits are supposedly appropriate for women and others for men.4\n\n \n\n\n4\nBy way of illustration, I will consider Sally Haslanger’s fascinating and innovative recent account of gender (“Gender and Race”; “Future Genders”; “Social Construction”), which has the conventionalist and abolitionist implications. Next, I will examine what precisely is problematic about these implications in order to motivate my alternative model. I will then outline my trait/norm covariance model, ending with a discussion of how it avoids the problematic ontological commitments considered.\n\n**Haslanger on Gender: An Example**\n\nHaslanger’s account of gender has conventionalist and abolitionist implications: it takes the existence of women and men to be mind-dependent in the sense of depending on human social practices and conventions, and it takes these conventions and practices to be oppressive—for her, since gender is a product of oppressive social forces feminists should aim to eradicate it. These implications are underpinned by a distinction between sex and gender that many feminists have historically endorsed. Paradigmatically: “sex” denotes human females and males depending on some biological features (like chromosomes, sex organs, hormones or other physical features to do with reproduction) whereas “gender” denotes women and men depending on some social factors (like social role, position, behaviour or identity). As is well known, the motivation for drawing the sex/gender distinction was to counter biological determinism that took some (supposedly) biological facts to explain behavioural and psychological differences between women and men. Instead, feminists argued that these differences have social causes. They distinguished biological and social/psychological differences and began using the term “gender” to denote the latter. For instance, Gayle Rubin (who was one of the first feminists to articulate this distinction) used the phrase “sex/gender system” in order to describe “a set of arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (165). For Rubin, although sex differences are fixed, gender differences are the oppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and men should behave: women are oppressed as women and “by having to be women” (204). For her, gender is the social interpretation of sex and an oppressive one at that. However, women’s oppression is mutable by political and social reform that abolishes gender. As Rubin saw it, feminism should aim to create a “genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (204).\n\nFor Haslanger, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining it we must make reference to social factors (“Ontology and Social Construction” 98), and, in particular, we must make reference to unequal social positions (“Gender and Race” 37–43). In so doing, Haslanger aims to debunk the ordinary view that gender classification is a matter of anatomy. Commonly, being female is thought to be sufficient for womanhood; Haslanger, on the other hand, takes the conditions for satisfying “woman” to be social rather than biological. Her project involves showing that although the use of the term “woman” is thought to track a group of “individuals defined by a set of physical ... conditions [it] is better understood as capturing a group that occupies a certain ... social position” (“Social Construction” 318). And the social positions that our gendered classification scheme tracks and that make gender ascriptions apt crucially involve reference to subordination and privilege. For Haslanger, societies in general tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies” (“Gender and Race” 38) so that the social positions they subsequently occupy are better than the social positions of those with female bodies. And this generates sexist injustices. For her:\n\n>S is a woman if [by definition] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n\n>S is a man if [by definition] S is systematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a male’s biological role in reproduction (“Future Genders” 6–7).\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman or a man: what makes calling S a woman apt is not that S is female, but that S is oppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man apt is not that S is male, but that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that debunking projects like hers sometimes require a “radical change in our thinking” (“Social Construction” 319). After all, her proposal is counterintuitive: privileged females like, arguably, the Queen of England would not count as women on this view. But Haslanger’s project does not aim to capture what ordinary language users intuitively have in mind and her aim is not to illuminate our commonsense understandings of gender terms. Haslanger’s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists should be using (“Gender and Race” 33).  That is, endorsing her classification scheme is a pragmatic political choice. And (Haslanger holds) feminists should choose her account of gender since it will be helpful in feminist fights against sexist injustices enabling feminists to identify and explain persistent inequalities between women and men in terms of their social positions. Insofar as Haslanger takes being a woman to be a social matter crucially tied to oppression, she holds that “it is part of the project of feminism to bring about a day when there are no more women (though, of course, we should not aim to do away with females!)” (“Gender and Race” 46). Since what it is to be a woman is by definition tied to sexist oppression, gender justice would eradicate women by abolishing those social structures that are responsible for sex-marked oppression. Women and men could not exist, unless sexist oppression existed; that women and men exist is mind-dependent being the result of oppressive human social activities. And feminism’s goal should be to dismantle those social structures responsible for gender and, by extension, women and men.\n\nProblems with the Conventionalist and Abolitionist Implications\n\nEarlier I claimed that ordinary thinking finds the conventionalist and abolitionist implications of accounts like Haslanger’s problematic. I also claimed that these problems are underpinned by a clash between different conceptions of sex and gender. Let’s examine the worries in more detail.\n\nThe Conventionalist View Is Unintuitive\n\nFor Haslanger (among others) gender depends on something social and not on anything biological. This prima facie makes being a woman ontologically on a par with being a US senator, a wife or a landlord. And, it seems, just as one can cease to be a wife by changing one’s social relations (by getting a divorce), one should be able to cease to be a woman by changing those social relations constitutive of womanhood. But a closer examination suggests that being a woman is not ontologically on a par with (say) being a wife. To tease this out, consider the following claims:\n\n(1)\tFor a week last summer, James was a woman.\n\n(2)\tFor a week last summer, James was a US senator.\n\nThese statements take “woman” and “US senator” as social notions. The first takes womanhood to be about easily perceptible gender markers like clothing and appearance (James lived “as a woman” for a week last summer). The second takes James to have been treated in ways that enabled him to count as a US senator for a week (for instance, James was elected to the US Senate, but due to a political scandal lost his position very quickly). Now, consider:\n\n(3)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a woman.\n\n(4)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a US senator.\n\nThese claims are not about social factors. We can understand claim (3) and it makes sense to us, although we are clearly using “woman” as a biological term. However, when we substitute “woman” for “US senator” in (4), the statement no longer makes sense to us. After all, just by looking at one’s body, it’s not possible to know that one is a US senator. That is, when used as a social term, “woman” is on a par with “US senator”. But we can also use “woman” as a biological term, which makes “woman” and “US senator” come apart. The upshot of this is that “woman” is not a purely social term ; for ordinary thinking, then, being a woman is not on a par ontologically with what it is to be a member of some other social kind. And this suggests that it is not obviously true that women and men’s existence is minddependent in that one can cease to be a woman (or a man) just by altering one’s social environment. Because ordinary thinking does not see being a woman as a purely social matter, conventionalist implications (like the implication that we can eradicate women and men via change in our social environments) are hard to accept. The paradigmatic feminist distinction between sex and gender clashes with everyday thinking. Due to this, ordinary thinking doubts the possibility of eradicating gender via social change, because it ties sex and gender together.\n\nA defender of the conventionalist view might hold that claim (3) doesn’t really make sense either, but we are fooled into believing that it does precisely because ordinary thinking ties sex and gender together when it shouldn’t. So, if we thought about womanhood in the right way, we would see that (3) is also senseless. That would leave claim (1) where “woman” is a social notion making it akin to “US senator”. My worries about unintuitive ontological commitments are dispelled prima facie making it possible for one to cease to be a woman just by altering one’s social environment. But this raises some further questions that the defender of the conventionalist view must answer: Precisely what kind of social change would abolish women and men? Which beliefs, social conventions, linguistic practices and relations would have to be altered for one to no longer count as a woman or a man? And which social institutions, relations and structures would have to be dismantled so that women and men were to cease to exist wholesale? These questions cannot be answered in any intuitively obvious introspective manner. In fact, answering them is the stuff of feminist philosophy and a huge point of contention. Admittedly, this contention may be generated by gender being such an incredibly complex phenomenon that discerning the kind of social change that would eradicate it is extremely difficult; we may simply be ignorant of the kind of change needed, but it is possible to eradicate gender via social change. This may be so. But it may also be that feminists cannot agree on what social changes would do away with women and men because doing so just by altering one’s social environment is not possible. Bluntly put, perhaps it is just plain wrong to think that women and men’s existence ontologically depends on some social factors. I am not concluding that it is; I am merely making a strategic point. The issue of, on which social conditions the existence of women and men depends, is so intractable as to be unhelpful. If gender really is such a complex issue that it is hugely difficult (if not impossible) to articulate and agree on what sort of social change would eradicate it, the most useful move would seem to be to give up the quest. Pragmatically, feminists should not try to uncover which social factors are responsible for the existence of women and men, but, instead, should settle for the much less contentious view that human actions significantly shape the way we are as women and men. No feminist (to the best of my knowledge) denies this claim. The concerns I have raised here are not decisive and do not rule out conventionalism about gender altogether. But, as I see it, the less contentious view I have floated here is the one that feminists ought to endorse precisely because of its less contentious commitments. \n\n**The Abolitionist Implication Is Undesirable**\n\nOn views like Haslanger’s, gender is also a product of oppressive social conditions and, thus, something feminists should seek to abolish. But this abolitionist view may not be conducive to feminist interests since for ordinary thinking it harbours undesirable ontological commitments. To tease this out, contrast such abolitionist strategies with a different (what I will call) “re-evaluative” strategy. They both have the same starting point: feminism is about ending oppression that women as women face. But their ways of achieving this goal differ, which alters the strategies’ outcomes. Abolitionist accounts take womanhood to be by definition tied to oppression so that it is not possible to be a woman and not be (in some sense) oppressed. Reevaluative accounts do not take being a woman to be per se oppressive. Instead, they recognise that our social circumstances create environments where women are viewed and treated in ways that disadvantage them, perhaps by associating some traits with women and using this association to justify disadvantageous treatment. Nonetheless, by altering how women are viewed and treated it is possible to be a woman and yet not be oppressed. So, on the former view, gender justice would dismantle unjust social hierarchies thus doing away with women and men; on the latter, it would dismantle such hierarchies while retaining women and men (roughly) in a re-evaluated sense.\n\nThe strategy to follow comes down to a pragmatic political choice. But if ordinary social agents think that eradicating gender is undesirable, it may be strategically wrongheaded to endorse an account of gender that has abolitionist implications. Some anecdotal evidence supports this: my feminism students tell me time and again that they think the abolitionist strategy is aiming to eradicate something that need not be eradicated—the “feminist revolution” need not do away with gender and doing so would result in (at least some) good being unnecessarily lost. Many insist that the ways in which people are treated as woman and men is the problem feminists should focus on—being a woman or a man is not primarily the problem. And many claim to find their gender a source of positive value. After all, it is certainly true that, although one may be discriminated against due to one’s gender, it can still be something one values positively; in a similar sense, one can take pride in one’s racial group membership despite being socially disadvantaged by it. The everyday conception of gender clashes with feminist conceptions like Haslanger’s. As a result, ordinary thinking doubts the viability of eradicating gender because it sees gender as being at least partly a positive social identity rather than being a wholly negative one.\n\nProjects like Haslanger’s do, of course, start by aiming to alter the ways in which we are viewed and treated as women and men. So, in a sense, the abolitionist and re-evaluative routes go hand-in-hand to begin with. But the abolitionist strategy runs into difficulties if many social agents are unwilling to follow it through. Haslanger is asking for a significant shift in people’s self-conceptions and acknowledges that she is asking social agents to understand themselves in ways that are not ordinarily part of their gendered self-understandings (“Gender and Race” 48). In so doing, she is “call[ing] upon us to reject what seemed to be positive social identities” and to refuse to be gendered women and men (“Gender and Race” 48). I agree with Haslanger that a change in our self-understandings is called for; but I wonder if the change that she is calling for is the right kind of change given that ordinary thinking does not see the viability of eradicating gender. Again, my point is strategic: accounts that have abolitionist implications are likely to be extremely demanding. It will take a lot of convincing to make ordinary social agents view their gender as not being even in part a positive social identity and to make them refuse to be gendered women and men, if social agents do not believe to begin with that this is necessary. And, one might wonder, whether scarce feminist resources should be directed at something other than trying to convince social agents to revise their self-understandings in this manner.\n\nFortunately my students always do express a desire to see an end to gendered oppression. And clearly this is what Haslanger also wants, which may suggest that really the parties to the debate are just talking past each other. Everyone wants the same thing: gender justice. Haslanger’s rhetoric just differs from how we ordinarily talk about women and men. Usually, acknowledging this does not dispel my students’ worries; they still find it puzzling that Haslanger doesn’t use gender terms as people ordinarily do and wonder why she is confusing matters with her conception of gender. Of course, Haslanger’s rhetoric has a specific, valuable purpose: to motivate a certain kind of social and political response that undermines sexist oppression. But, given the kinds of worries I have mentioned here, strategically I think that this kind of response can be better motivated by understanding the phenomena feminists discuss under the rubric of sex and gender in a way that does not imply women and men no longer exist “after the revolution”. The worry is that accounts with abolitionist implications probably would not motivate positive social change, if this change requires that social agents must give up something they do not want to give up.\n\n**The Trait/Norm Covariance Model**\n\nThis section develops my trait/norm covariance model as an alternative to the sex/gender distinction. To begin with, it is important to note that, contrary to traditional feminist views, I do not take the term “woman” to be a purely social gender term. Ordinary speakers have, to use Ron Mallon’s terminology, indicative features in mind when they call someone a “woman”:\n\n>there is a distinction between those properties that are indicative of category membership (such as easily perceptible racial [or gender] markers), and those that are central. A property is indicative of category membership if having the property increases the likelihood that one is a member of a category. In the United States wearing a dress is indicative of being a woman ... [But w]earing a dress is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a woman.\n\n(652–3)\n\nIndicative features of womanhood include one’s appearance (clothing, hairstyles, make-up); behavioural patterns; social roles; and anatomical and bodily features (body type, shape, size, amount of body hair and how one “carries” one’s body). These features are conceivably involved in everyday gender ascriptions. Paradigmatically, feminists hold that the indicative features mentioned are not exclusively gender traits in that they include features which are taken to be paradigmatic sex traits (to do with being female or male). But, ordinary language users often deploy “woman” on the basis of anatomical sex features such as body type; “woman” is not a purely gender term for them, but (bluntly put) a mixture of sex and gender. So, ordinarily “woman” denotes individuals who are taken to possess features indicative of womanhood. This does not (and certainly should not) limit the application of “woman” to women-born-female; the term also applies to trans women, individuals “assigned male at birth whose gender presentation may be construed as ‘unambiguously’ female” (Bettcher 46), who call themselves “women”.\n\nMy contention is that feminists should use the term “woman” as ordinarily as possible. And the trait/norm covariance model that I will outline next will be sensitive to these reflections about ordinary language use. The model I am proposing deals roughly with the same phenomena that the sex/gender distinction does. It just understands that phenomena in a different way that is, I submit, more fruitful in being more congenial to everyday thinking. On my view, we redraw the boundaries of the sets of gender traits and sex traits giving up the labels “sex” and “gender” to denote those traits. Instead, the traits are divided into sets of descriptive traits and evaluative norms. The former (in a sense) describe “the way the world is” and include physical and anatomical traits (e.g., chromosomes, ovaries, testes, genitalia, body shape and size), one’s appearance (e.g., one’s clothing, make-up, haircut, amount of body hair), roles (e.g., whether one undertakes caretaking roles, engages in childrearing tasks) and self-conceptions (calling oneself a woman or a man). These are features of which there are “facts of the matter”—it isn’t in any sense mysterious or down to value judgements whether one has ovaries, undertakes childrearing tasks, or calls oneself a woman. (This does not mean that values were not involved in singling out descriptive features, like anatomical traits, or that descriptive features are not socially malleable; but more on this shortly.) Evaluative norms are to do with stereotypical judgements: whether one is judged to be, to appear to be and/or to act in ”feminine”, ”masculine” or “neutral” ways. Evaluative norms attributed reflect value judgements and cultural norms. So, on my and the paradigmatic feminist schemas:\n\n Paradigmatic feministmodel|.. |Trait/normcovariancemodel | ..\n--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------\nSex\t               |Gender                 |Descriptive traits\t   |Evaluative norms\nHaving ovaries\t|Wearing make-up |Having ovaries\t           |Being “feminine”\n\t                |Being “feminine”   |Wearing make-up\t|\n\nWhat does it mean to say that evaluative norms covary with descriptive traits? Just that we take certain traits to be of certain kind. So, the trait/norm covariance relation is constituted by particular descriptive traits being viewed in a particular manner by us. I take “femininity” to mean “associated with women”, “masculinity” to mean “associated with men” and “neutrality” to mean “associated with neither or both”. That is, depending on how we view particular descriptive traits, they either covary with femininity, masculinity or neutrality. And certain trait/norm pairings are currently linked to women, others to men and still others to neither or both. They can be so linked in a global or (more often than not) in a local manner. For instance, being short-sighted is globally neutral: as far as I know, the trait is nowhere associated exclusively with either women or men thereby globally covarying with neutrality. Then again, possession of testes appears to be globally masculine, possession of ovaries globally feminine. Quite often, though, the trait/norm pairings are local differing from one context to the next and depending on social and cultural factors. So, although all cultures have traits that covary with femininity and others that covary with masculinity, the configurations of these trait/norm pairings can differ depending on their location. To illustrate, take long hair. In many UK communities it is no longer strongly associated with women and often covaries with neutrality. However, in UK Asian-Indian communities that do not consider it appropriate for those picked out by “woman” to have short hair, having long hair covaries more strongly with femininity. But, of course, other social and cultural axes affect this covariance relation even within a culture: in many UK Indian Sikh contexts, neither men nor women are expected to cut their hair, which suggests that (in these social contexts) having long hair covaries with neutrality. However, in these contexts, other practices to do with hair covary with femininity and masculinity, like the practice of Sikh men wearing turbans. The trait/norm pairings are interrelated: with those picked out by “man”, the pairing “having long hair/neutrality” is interrelated with “wearing a turban/masculinity”; but for those picked out by “woman” the former pairing is not interrelated with the latter pairing. (For more on Asian social conventions to do with hair, see Hiltebeitel and Miller.) The trait/norm covariance relations can also change over time. Wearing trousers is a good example: until quite recently in many Western Anglo-European contexts, masculinity covaried with it. But, relatively quickly, in many contexts it has become neutral. It is now socially acceptable for someone ordinarily picked out by “woman” to wear trousers. The same social value is no longer attached to this trait. Of course, this all further demonstrates that the ways in which the trait/norm covariance relations pan out are not always straightforward. Since the relations depend on beliefs and conventions that change over time and place, they will usually be manifestations of some local and contextspecific beliefs and conventions. There are many complications not least because of differences in contexts and in what norms social agents project on descriptive traits. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that sometimes seeing how the relations pan out is not complicated and that sometimes social agents do not differ significantly in their ascriptions of norms.\n\nI have said that certain descriptive traits covary with certain evaluative norms, but what explains this covariance relation? I take the existence of this relation to be a thoroughly mind-dependent matter. If you like, wearing make-up and engaging in child-care (to name two descriptive traits) are not inherently or mind-independently feminine–that femininity covaries with them is something that depends for its existence on social factors and obtains because of us. The classification scheme of feminine, masculine and neutral evaluative norms is a strong pragmatic construction; that is, social factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent accurately any “facts of the matter” (Haslanger, “Ontology and Social Construction” 100). So, the classification scheme does not pick out any mind-independent facts about descriptive traits. That some traits are viewed as feminine, masculine or neutral is a consequence of “human-made” fashions, styles, cultural beliefs, social conventions and linguistic practices, which determine what features are judged to be of what kind. The classification scheme of feminine/masculine/neutral is a mere social construction. Furthermore, this scheme tends to be hierarchal in grading traits; this is evident from the devaluing of many activities and features with which femininity covaries (like the devaluing of caretaking work).\n\nOn my model the claim “Jane is feminine because Jane wears make-up” does not capture any mind-independent fact about the world. Yet, my model also takes wearing make-up to be a descriptive trait of which there is “a fact of the matter”. So, it appears that saying Jane wears make-up does capture something mind-independent about the world. It is worth clarifying the notion of mind-independence here to avoid an air of inconsistency. Consider driving. In the United Kingdom, people drive on the left-hand side of the road; in the United States, they drive on the right. Which convention is the correct or true one? We cannot say because the context-specific conventions that govern driving are mind-dependent: they depend for their existence on productive human social practices and require that certain human-made background conditions are in place. Such conventions are, of course, mutable. The UK government could just decide to alter conventions governing driving. Obviously doing so in practice would be hugely difficult and certainly no easy feat. But the point is that ultimately conventions come down to us—there is no mind-independent fact about which side of the road is the correct side for driving. However, that people drive on the left in the United Kingdom is mind-independent in another sense. When I state “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” I am stating something that is true mind-independently: the truth of the statement is not (if you like) up for grabs. I cannot just decide that the statement is false and drive on the right. (Or, I could, but probably with quite tragic results.) So, given certain background conditions, it is a mind-independent fact that in the United Kingdom people drive on the left irrespective of the fact that the convention to drive on the left is minddependent.\n\nThe descriptive trait of wearing make-up is akin to the convention of driving on the left: it is mind-dependent in that it is a trait that depends for its existence on particular human-made social conditions (it requires that certain human-made background conditions are in place). The trait is also socially mutable: wearing make-up might, for example, go out of fashion thus prompting people to abandon the practice. Nonetheless, that Jane wears make-up is (in another sense) mind-independent. The truth or falsity of the statement “Jane wears make-up” is not up for grabs: either she does or she doesn’t. This is akin to the claim “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left”: however mind-dependent—due to productive human activities— the respective conventions (to drive on the left and to wear make-up) are, whether the statements “Jane wears make-up” and “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” are true or false is not open to debate given our current conventions. By contrast, the claim “The convention to drive on the left is better than the convention to drive on the right” is utterly mind-dependent. Whether this statement is thought to be true or false depends on one’s view or opinion, in addition to the convention to drive on the left being a product of human social practices. \n\nNow, although it is a mind-independent feature of reality that Jane wears makeup, that Jane acts in a feminine way because she wears make-up is mind-dependent. It does not capture any mind-independent facts about the world, like some supposed fact that the practice of wearing make-up is inherently feminine. That femininity covaries with wearing make-up is mind-dependent obtaining due to productive human activities—because of us. This further illustrates that the trait/norm covariance relation is not a causal relation in the sense that the former causes the latter.\n\nChildcare activities or the practice of wearing make-up do not cause femininity to covary with them; rather, our beliefs and judgements cause this. To illustrate, think about morality. Standardly moral philosophers agree that the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness. But does the act cause moral goodness? This depends on one’s metaethical commitments. For some moral realists, the answer might be yes: the act of giving to charity instantiates a realist (non-natural) moral property of goodness. So, the act of giving to charity literally causes moral goodness to pop up in the world because one’s actions instantiate the property of goodness. For moral constructivists, however, the answer might be no: the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness because we project moral goodness onto the act of giving to charity. Roughly, we have constructed a moral world in which giving to charity is considered good. So, the relation between giving to charity and moral goodness is not a causal one in that the former causes the latter. That giving to charity is considered to be morally good is down to us. The same appears to be true of what I have said about descriptive traits and evaluative norms: we have constructed a gendered world in which childcare and wearing make-up are considered to be feminine. That is, we— human social agents—are responsible for these covariance relations. And this being fortunately the case, we can also alter them so that childcare, for instance, no longer covaries with femininity.\n\n[continued below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6yp60e/ontological_commitments_sex_and_gender_by_mari/dmp1uid/)",

    "text": "How to find low competition job or how to choose career ? Hi all, my name is Tony and i am 25 yr old. I would like to share my experience in choosing career and picking jobs... \n\nI would like to ask you for career advice...  \n\nI dont know where to start so i will just write down what ever come to my mind...\n\nLike every teenager i had to choose path(career) for myself and work hard to make a living. I started in Video (DVD) store as general labour when i was 18. After that i moved to Australia because all of this \"good life articles\" etc.  \n\nI decided to start with building (construction) because it was fairly easy to get into and money was decent... I was planning to master one field in construction and to become professional...\n  \nI did not count on bullying, pain, long hours, and terrible working conditions, but i was like : \"Hey whatever in few years it will be beneficial if i stay here...\"  \n\nThen after 6-8 month`s i started realising that i would probably need 10 years in this industry to become Master... even than i would need to break my back in order to earn good money (Still you need to fight with customers, run for contactors to pay you the money that you already earn etc...)\n  \nSo i Quited, and i decided to become Security equipment installed, because i finished 4 years DC / low voltage electronic school in Europe (whatever i knew some basics etc...)\n\nI got job, and i started to learn about Alarms, Cameras, Access controls and many other electronic devices...  \n\nI can say that i was really good at it after 1 year, i was able to do solo installation, programming, troubleshooting etc...\n\nAfter that i realised that if you want to have decent money you would need to have your own company (vehicle, tools, customer base etc etc... and still you would have to chase new customers, keep old ones, and a lot more things in order to survive...)\n\nWhen i first started i saw ad`s such as \"75.000$ year, your own vehicle bla bla...\" i was thinking wtf this is gold mine...  \n\nIn reallity, to earn 75.000 you would need to work 7 days a week, and like 12 hours shifts, and to deal with crazy people, shty jobs, far away locations, + you would need at least 10+ years of experience...\n\nAll in all it was shty job, it`s not about how smart you are, its about how fast can you climb on ladders, or run cables on 10m heights, how good you are with hammer drill (not to mention, if you hit pipe or something you would have to pay all damage...)  \n\nSo i quited... Next thing i was get into was factory labour, becase i tough it`s secure job, not that much stress, little bit less money but why not ?!\n\nI manage to get job in factory with 23.5$/ hourly as product line labour... i was really happy (first day)...  \n\nThan i found out that you have to do 12-14 hours shifts with 300 asians ( NOTHING AGAINST ASIANS ) , they have to work 12-16 hours hard labour work in order to stay in country... so you have low chance to compete with them, and there is no room for any kind of complain...  \n\nI Asked my manager after 3-4 month of that shty job, is there any chance to work on promotion, like to become supervisor or something that is not HARD LABOUR 100%, (this job was lifting 10-30 KG constantly for 12 hours minimum, fast paced environment), and She told me yes, there is... Usually you need to work for the company for 5 years and to stay alive without injury or something... and than they can consider option to give you better position or something (for 2-3$ extra)...  \n\nLong story-short i quited after 6 month of that work...  \nI was desperate and almost suicidal because i was lost i had no idea what to do... Than i decided to get into programming because i used to do web development when i was 16-18...  \n\nSimply i started with JavaScript, PhP, Css etc... i decided that i am going to sacrifice 2 years of my life, on everyday learning...  \n\nI finished at least 10 books, 20 online courses from codeacademy, udemy, linda etc... I have like 30 personal websited, bunch of small codes, projects, small web apps, forums, social ETC...  \n\nSo i decided to do job hunt... I managed to find one company (12 yr old with a lot of clients etc.) , guy offered me position to work for free, and to get some experience even if i have 2+ years experience (+ fiver gigs, upwork freelance etc)...  \n\nI worked first 2 weeks for nothing and it was ok for me because i needed formal exp, than he offered me 200$ week 5/7 days, and that is WAY BEYOND MINIMUM WAGE, it`s 5$/hour in Australia...  \n\nMinimum Wage is 15.5$ even if you do most shty job...  \nAnyway i accepted... , after few more weeks i heard my boss talking about \"Overseas monkeys\", how they work for nothing etc...  \n\nSo yeah i quited..., and i tried with other ad`s...  \nProblem is in outsorcing, it`s hard to compete with Indians (NOTHING AGAINST INDIANS) , because they can work for 5$ whole day from India...  \n\nFor entry level jobs in Web - Dev, just check ads , you have to know : html,css/bootstrap/less/sass/js/frameworks/jquery/php/larver/other frameworks/wordpress/customisation/themes/React/Angular/Git/ and all kind of sht...  in order to get entry lvl job...  \n\nSo my 2 years of hardwork+learning = entry lvl job = FAIL\n\nTo be expert or at least fluent with all of these technology above you would need at least 3-4 years + work experience (that you probably wont get, how to find job with out exp... + industry) is already FULL of \"Web developers\" and other specialists...  \n\nAnyway i will continue with improvements and with learning new technologies and programming languages but not that intensive like i used to, because i lost faith about becoming web-dev.  \nReason is simple, How to risk 5-10yrs of your life, with constantly learning new tech, 12 hours of coding, fixing things etc... when you know that all your hard work can be outsorced (overseas) for 5$ etc... I dont know tbh it kinda sux... Not worth at all, it`s all because articles such as \"Web developers earning bunch of $$$\", \"top 10 jobs - #3 web design\", etc.... It`s double side coin but yeah i was naive ^^..  \n\nWell i decided to become \"smart\", and to do big re-search before i dive into new \"career\"... I wanted to do something with low competition, or something that is fairly easy to get into junior position roles. Only thing i wanted is job where you can improve your skills and progress, example: \"road from junior front end dev to Web master bla bla\"...  \n\nSo i saw article \"Nurse shortage in Australia\"...  \nnext ting i done is checking payscale: 65.000-110.000$ , i was :  \n\"Why not ?! , there will be blood but what ever, i like to help people, its decend career with oportunity to specialise latter on etc\"... To become nurse you can go Tafe 1.5 year , or Uni 3 years  \nand i saw info \"86% our students get job even before course ends\" bla bla... I was so happy, because i found something cool, that is worth doing(studying)...  \n\nI did some more research :), and i found out that there is no f***** nurse shortage in Australia, and that it`s only Goverment politics to get more immigrants for some reason i dont know why and i dont care...   Just i found out that out of 4000 new graduate nurses , only 20% are lucky to get job`s, and not the hospital ones... Those jobs are in rural areas, or age care homes far away from cities etc...  \n\nSo i was ohhh thx god i saw all this info, and read all this forum posts, because if i went 3 years to become Nurse (+i would have to work / study and to pay bills by myself etc. struggle) and to find out on the end that there is like 0.001% chance to find job, i dont know i would jump from bridge... \n\nThen i started to looking for something else ofc... and i was thinking, what is fairly BORING, and hard job that not much ppl want or like to do ?! It`s Networking (cyber security etc)... I know that a lot of ppl is passionate about that, and its actually very interesting field, but tbh for most ppl its boring, hard etc...  \nI decided to do re-search of that field...  \n\nLong story short: There is not enough networking job ad`s (in general, network admins, security, all-fields)  \nand existing ads in Australia (at least QLD,VIC) looking for 5+ years experience, list of things you need to know even for entry lvl job with 40.000-50.000$ (that ok money for me, but if you compare it with things/skills that you need to have under your belt this salary SUUUUUUUX)...  also market/industry going up and down, and even 10+ yr experienced guys have hard time to keep or to find new job...  (Tbh , WTF ?!)  \n\nSo i gave up on all those things, and i did google search on low competition jobs (in Australia), and only thing i managed to find is \"Mining jobs\" (I dont want to be rude or arrogant, but only dirty jobs...)  \n\nFinally... My question is: what i suppose to do ? I can become removalist or something like that, because my back will break before 35, and what to do than ? Same thing for coffe or barista... Everyone looking for young ppl, and everyone like femals over males, so it`s not career to get into really...  \n\nIs there some kind of certificate such as CCNA (cisco), or Nurse (diploma), that can really boost your % chances to get a job ?  \n\nAny idea, opinion, advice or anything else is more than welcome.\n\nThank you",

    "text": "[California] Indian-American and I believe I am receiving discrimination at my workplace. Do I have any recourse? A year ago I got hired to a pretty diverse team. The original manager of the department was great and my work environment was okay. About 6 months ago our manager got replaced by a new manager; who I will call Bob. Everything seemed normal and Bob was professional with all of us. Gradually though I notice signs that I am on the receiving end of discrimination. \n\nOur department was originally a quarter Indian. My coworkers left for multiple reasons unrelated to Bob but none terminated. I noticed that Bob replaced them all with White or Eastern-Asian ultimately making me the only Indian in the team. \n\nThis made me suspect something but I brushed it off that it was a coincidence. About 2 months ago, I was not assigned to be a Project Lead after I finished a project that was leftover from my old manager. When we got more projects, Bob gave all of my coworkers some form of project lead position except for me. I was assigned purely as a supporter role. Our old workflow was that everyone was a lead for one project and was a supporter role for a different project. I was the only one that was overlooked for a Project Lead role. The replacements got Project Lead with one receiving two projects. I brought this up with Bob and he brushed it off with that he'd like someone purely concentrated on one role as a contingency; so far I am the only one that has one role. \n\nThe gossiper on my team made an off-remark of how my boss does not trust Indians. I concluded that this was the reason Bob chose not to hire Indians and passed me over. \n\nI requested a transfer to HR and told them that I suspected discrimination as my reason. HR denied my request because the branch did not allow transfers and my claims were \"unsubstantiated\". Apparently they interviewed the gossiper and he denied what he told me. Now everyone is keeping their distance from me. \n\nI would like to quit but reviewing my situation I have concluded that I cannot quit for at least a year. Its a combination of personal professional reasons. \n\nWhat are my options? I am lost on how to handle this.",

    "text": "I was slut shamed as a kid in high school. Sometimes it really bothers me. I need to vent. Well, I am Indian. I am 19 now. When I was 15, I was made to stand up in class, and called a slut in front of everyone by a male teacher just because I was tom-boyish and had way more male friends than female ones. \n\nThat teacher had discussed my “slutiness” with other teachers in the school and they all had the same mentality, so I was looked at by all teacher the same way as Hester Prynne and had an invisible red “S” letter around my neck. They all antagonized me just because of my tom-boyish nature and thought of me as a slut. I was outspoken, they did not like that either. That just added to my shameless slutty nature. \n\nI had no friends. No one at school would even look at me or talk to me. I couldn't ask the teachers for any help. They wouldn't. They wouldn't let me participate in competitions, since I would bring shame to the school with my slutty nature. They'd make me sit in the last bench all by myself. \n\nI was punished way more harshly for meager mistakes than any other kid. I'd have a note written to my parents, or I'd be made to stand in class and listen to the teacher go on and on about character. \n\nMy studies suffered. The last year in the school, in 10th grade, I was sick asf. Missed 7 months. When I came back, I did not get any help from any teacher. I had missed out a lot, and the teachers wouldn't help me with anything. I took supplemental classes and covered up about 200 chapters in 3 months. I gave my exam, i was confident of scoring atleast 75/80 in every subject. \n\nThen the results came. The written paper was external assessment of 80 marks, which was only student dependent. The internal assessment of 20 marks, entirely depended on the teachers. This was a matriculation certificate examination. It had some great value. Turns out, I'd scored about 75 in every subject. Give or take 2 marks. The teachers gave me 5/20 on the internal, on every subject. I ended up with an 83 percent instead of a 95. \n\nI don't even care about the names they called me or how they judged me. I had to cover 200 chapters in 3 months. I cannot begin to tell you how much hardwork and labour it took. And I managed to do well, regardless of my circumstances but they intentionally brought me down with the internal. Even when they knew I needed those marks like crazy. \n\nIt's like they had developed something personal against me for talking to the boys in my class. My hard work didn't matter much in the end. I worked so hard so that I could give the KVPY, a national level science exam for getting a seat in the top research institute in the country. I didn't qualify as my score was below the qualification cut off. \n\nWell done, teachers. \n\nEdit: that kind of behavior on the teachers' part had started when I was 13. It reached it's peak when I was 15. I never realized why the teachers didn't like me even though I was a sincere student and scored well. \n\nThe teacher who called me a slut, used to call my friends into his office and ask them to not talk to me. Since I was a \"bad influence\". If they didn't listen, he'd tell the same to their parents in PTA meetings, and the parents believing a teacher, would make their kids not talk to me. \n\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the supportive comments, Reddit! Really appreciate it.",

    "text": "Burnt my bridges with an employer who was narcissistic, egotistic AND didn't pay my overtime wages. Tl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court. \n\nStory starts back in 2015. I had been working part time at numerous jobs for 2 ½ years at this point (after having been full time for a while) and was incredibly frustrated with the lack of income. Some of the jobs I held down would go from giving me 39 hours a week to less than 5 hours, and while I had the support of my husband to keep us afloat, I couldn’t stand not being able to financially provide. So when I interviewed for a corporate but franchised owned hotel, I was ecstatic. This establishment, of which we’ll nickname Vacation Hotel, was a little franchised, family owned hotel that seemed fantastic to work for. I distinctly remember leaving the interview thinking “WOW. I want to work there!!”\n\nIt’s funny, because looking back on it, every employee who came and left had thought the same thing. And boy, did this hotel have more turnover then they let on. The manager – who we’ll name Kyle – had the same charm in all his interviews. He put on a damn good show, so good no one could see how fake it was. He did, after all, go to law school – and the more you got to know him, the easier it was to tell. \n\nKyle had charm. He spoke about how he treated each and every employee he had like family, so much so that he had leant a former employee money for a new car after they had been in an accident.  This was a story he told in every one of his interviews, though you wouldn’t know it at first. He spoke about how he hated large corporations and would treat his employees like humans, not robots. He’d even “randomly give raises” when he saw good performance, instead of waiting for annual reviews. I not only remember these things from my interview, but I began to watch him interview more and more people during my year there…of which, he gave the same speech with the same genuine realness. \nKyle became one of the biggest frauds I’d ever dealt with. Narcissistic and egotistic aren’t words that do his behavior justice. And it took me some time to accept that. Because him and his family “treated” everyone like they were, indeed, family. You fell for it, and you began to do everything you could for them. You felt obligated to be the best employee you can for such a “great and kind boss” who would give you the shirt off his back. Kyle always found a way to rope you in – he didn’t explain in his interviews that working full time did NOT mean you got benefits, in fact I saw many people assume it like I did. No health care, no time off, nothing. You worked for your hourly wage and that was it. This was one of the biggest bummers to me shortly after starting, as I had wished he told me up front in the interview. The second biggest bummer was when he explained he “did not budget for overtime.” No one could give me an answer to how he got away with this. I considered asking him, but I let it go.\n\nYou see, Kyle promised me big things. He was opening another hotel. And after having a 2 ½ year stint of struggling to find work, the idea of a stable career made me ecstatic. Kyle promised me a salary, a positon, and a future. While deep in my heart I had no desire for the hotel business, money does talk. And the numbers he showed me said a lot – it said stability. So Kyle ensured me I’d be experiencing all of this; money, stability, a career – if I showed my worth. He wasn’t “just going to hand it” to me until I showed I was capable. While most employers will promote you and then train you, Kyle did things backwards. He’d train and then promote. Why? Kyle was a penny pitcher. “Why pay me the salary if I don’t know what I’m doing?” and “It’ll catch up to you in the end, you’ll be making more money than you can dream of.” \n\nI fell for it. Kyle did things to make you want to stay – he’d act like he cared for you. He gave multiple employees loans when they fell short on money, though I refused to fall into it. But hell, I did get into a situation where my husband and I wanted to rent somewhere else but our credit was too damaged to get a place, so he called a potential landlord and recommended me for the townhouse we now live in. I was grateful for that, but never let it tie me down. I didn’t ask for it, he was kind enough to do it for me. And while he did a wonderful favor, I know in my heart I would get by without him. \n\nRegardless, I started training with the measly hourly income that every other front desk employee got. I was doing the work of Director of Sales for the hotel, Housekeeping Management, and accounting. It was becoming exhausting, and as Kyle was beginning to open that other hotel – guaranteeing I would be the general manager – I began to look for other work during my free time. I really didn’t want the job anymore. But I soaked up the experience from him until I left.\n\nThe biggest downfall from Kyle was two things.  Number 1 – I began to see that he had a major anger problem. He was a perfectionist. Something told me it had something to do with his nationality of being Indian, and how his father who owned the hotel would scrutinize him for the smallest mistake. Mistakes were NOT allowed at his hotel. Not the smallest, itty bitty mistake. If one of his bills was overcharged by $2, and I paid that amount, he’d go full Hulk on me. The yelling from him started to kill my confidence. My fellow co-workers began to notice how exhausted, tired and stressed I was becoming. I let them know that I was always walking on eggshells, no mistake was allowed during my shift. If it happened, he’d shout and yell at you like you were child, using words like “stupid” and “dumb” – and he wouldn’t pull you into his office, he’d do it publicly. \n\nNumber 2 – Kyle didn’t follow the law. It wasn’t “in his budget” to pay overtime. He felt he could reward his employees with random bonuses (of which never truly happened) as opposed to paying the dues owed. In my “training” it was a requirement to work 45-55 hours a week, 6 days a week.  I didn’t receive a cent of that in overtime, just my hourly wage. I also found out very quickly how heavily taxed you are in pay when you work over 40 hours.  So the extra $100 or so I was “making” a week really came out to be $20 or so after taxes. When I asked not to work over 40 hours, suddenly it wasn’t allowed. I would be stripped of my titles because a “real manager works as hard and as long as they need to.” And I would need to get used to “working 60-80 hours a week if needed.” This was all fine and dandy, but if I was working these hours, I wanted the right pay. He made it clear it wasn’t happening. “All would be paid in due time.” So while Kyle went on multiple trips – London, India, Las Vegas, New York – I managed the hotel. I did his job for him, of which he made clear that I was doing as much. At first it was appealing to be an acting general manager…until it wore me down.\n\nIt wasn’t until a fellow co-worker sat me down and told me up front about how she felt regarding the situation. I was shocked to hear her say she felt I was being used, abused and mistreated. But I agreed with her. She was looking for work, I was looking for work – we both wanted out. I still did my job, but stopped caring very quickly. As the rose colored glasses fell of completely, I saw him mistreat and abuse others. Inside the establishment that seemed so fantastic was really an ugly family who used their employees to gain profit. \n\nI can’t say I would have left when I did if it weren’t for my husband’s accident. In autumn of 2016, he got into a terrible motorcycle accident. He was flown to shock trauma and spent 4 days there, having needed surgery on his arm and knee. Of course I immediately called out of my next shift, but later that day as I waited for his surgery to take place; Kyle kept blowing up my phone asking when I’d be back and if I could return the next day for work. After all, Kyle’s wife (who also worked at the hotel) was newly pregnant and stopped working immediately. So he “needed” me there to “run” the hotel. He didn’t like the answer I had for him – I needed time off. Not having benefits for such a thing, he made it seem like a requirement to return to work. As I had already been losing my patience with him, this became the last straw. Just like I distinctly remember my interview with him, it was the moment in the hospital waiting room that I distinctly remember making a life alternating decision – my family came first. And if that meant being there but not providing thousands of dollars, I would take it. I couldn’t imagine having to rush back to a freaking hotel instead of being with my injured husband, all because the housekeepers needed help. While that was his life, it wasn’t the life for me.\n\nNot even 5 weeks after his accident did I find another job and put in my resignation. I held out until I found a job with benefits, so I could stop paying an arm and leg to the Afford Care Act. I sent him an email, wrote him a hand written letter, and gave him 2 weeks notice. I was hoping to part peacefully, but that wish never came true. A couple days later I was pulled into his office and he spent an hour convincing me of why I needed to stay and everything I’d be giving up (it was always money with Kyle) if I left. I stayed firm, even as he promised an immediate raise and large bonus in my next paycheck. He promised to pay my health care from the ACA and even start giving me vacation time. Having told him three times my answer was final; I was then berated for a period of time that I can’t even remember. It was almost surely a half an hour that he told me I was going to fail in life, that I’d go nowhere – especially without him, and I’d never get such a great opportunity like he had given me. \n\nIt was in that moment, I knew I made the right choice.\nWe left on civil terms, regardless of how he treated me during that moment. I kept in touch – hell, I even did a Saturday or two in shifts for him while I started my new job. And then I filed a complaint with the Department of Labor for unpaid overtime wages. Per the DOL, you have to request the unpaid wages first before you take the employer to court. So I wrote up a letter, calculated from my pay stubs the amount I was owed, and certified mailed it to him. \n\nI heard back the day he received the letter. 13 text messages blew up my phone at once, all about how he was such a great friend to me, how dare I do such a thing, I willing worked those hours, I have no right to “steal” this money from him, how he helped me get the house I live in and how I’d regret my decision to send that letter. \n\nKyle was smart. Kyle knew that if he didn’t pay me what I asked for, it’d go to court and he’d owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to all his other employees who were owed unpaid overtime. It was better for him to pay what I was owed as opposed to everyone else. My response was civil – I quoted the FSLA and once again requested only what I was owed in unpaid overtime. He said he’d have a check for me in a couple days with payroll, and would mail it to me as I requested.  \n\nI was hoping that would be it for us. He’d send his check and we’d call it a burnt bridge. Instead, that Friday that he was going to mail it, he showed up at my doorstep. For 5 minutes he banged on the door like a primal animal – I was upstairs taking a nap and my husband was downstairs, quite frankly, ignoring it. I’ll be honest, we really don’t answer the door unless we know we’re expecting guest, as we get a lot of solicitors in our neighborhood. It wasn’t until I was woken up by my phone blowing up – it was Kyle, saying he was outside and if I wanted the check, I needed to open the door.\n\nF. That. Sh!t. He wasn’t coming into my safe space, my HOME, to berate and abuse me. I wouldn’t allow it. I knew from experience what would happen, as I had seen him withhold employee’s last paychecks until they came to pick it up when he was at the hotel so he could put them down and call them horrible, stupid people. He wasn’t going to do that in my home. I asked my husband to deal with him. According to him, it was hard to get the check – not because he was my husband and not the person the check was addressed to, but rather Kyle kept trying to pass on messages through him. \n\n“Tell her we could have done this face to face, and it’s a shame she had to let it come to this, and that she’s a coward, she’ll never go anywhere, ect ect.” Not hearing it, my husband told him to keep his business out of our home and to hand the check over or leave.\n\nAt the end of the day, I got my owed wages. I know I came out on top, though I’m greatly angered that Kyle tried to invade my personal space at home with his petty anger. I’ve learned a great lesson from this experience, and feel like a much better person after it all. I’ll no longer give all of myself to any employer, no matter what they promise me or even what they pay me. If I can’t divide my time between my personal life and my job, I need to step away from the latter. Because life is too short to spend my entire day away from the things I truly love. A job is a job, but my family is my life. \n\nTl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court.",

(Sorry, it is quite long)\n\nHere's some background. I've completed a three year bachelor degree in engineering science and am now working on my masters in a specialist area in engineering. My long term goal was to always finish my masters and then work in industry. I got average marks in my undergrad and never really enjoyed university. The content was interesting, but I struggled keeping focus on class/study and had terrible time management problems. Was never a particularly happy individual with minimal friends but just accepted that to be my personality.  \n\nFast forward to one year into my masters. Pretty much have a nervous break down and diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Drop out of some units and scrap a pass in others. I attend class sporadically and spend days at a time not leaving my room. Finally psychologist figures out I have adhd and now on a waiting list to see a psychiatrist (which is $700 for the first appointment alone..). I'm miserable, alone, and generally hate my life. I should be graduating, instead I'm 5 units short of graduating and haven't written my thesis (which will take a year). It's not that the content is overly difficult, it's just that the drive I once had is gone and I'm sick of student life/study.\n\nI've got some interviews lined up in technology consulting for fairly reputable companies. The pay is good, but not as good as whats offered in the area of engineering I studied. Family is pushing me to finish my masters, saying I will regret my decision not to complete my masters in the future. \n\nBut aside from my mental heath issues,  being a female in engineering is hard. At the university I attend, my specialist area has roughly 5% females. Even though I'm from my countries dominant ethnicity (white), most of my class mates are asian/indian. I don't have a cultural support group like many others. I don't really know if I want to work in this industry any more, and be subjected to what I have been put though in university. Any internships or awards I get are put down to me being female. In group projects I'm belittled and ignored. I've been asked if I understand first year content while being a masters student. \n\nSo simply... I just don't know what to do",

Unit nursing educator and charge nurse say \"let's go, darkbyrd.\" Escalated to a code blue en route.\n\nGet there and it's already crowded. Pt on stretcher in tiny waiting room in-suite. Got in line, did compressions trading off with residents (wat?). Constantly conflicting orders from doctors getting an airway and icu nurse running the code. Too many chiefs, not enough Indians. Doctors say stop compressions, lead nurse says keep going. Failed intubation. Thirty people in the hall, doing (and able to do) nothing. More bag, more compressions. Rhythm check, clear, and push again. Repeat. No plan to switch off compressions, are you tired I'm behind you, ready. Called after twenty minutes.\n\nWe all get training in how to push. That's the easy part. How to make it happen as a team, that is what makes the difference. After the fact it was admittedly a shit show. Immediate debriefing over the stretcher right then brought up issues with antiquated equipment (guess no-one expected a code in outpatient radiology), role confusion, and looky-loos. Later debriefing with members of my unit revealed shitty management of the code (not by the icu nurse actually in charge, but by other leadership present), ineffective compressions by the residents I was switching off with. I was told I did a good job, I hope it was honest, and not encouragement for a rookie. Later, a private debrief with my management to assess my mental coping with the situation (unnecessary, but very much appreciated) and an explanation on how it should have gone down.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for with this post. Part of this is just I needed to share it. Unfortunate outcomes are the name of the game. Sometimes even in outpatient radiology. But part of this is I want to be better in my role. My class schedule prohibits me from taking an ACLS course for a long time, even though I've been invited to do so. \n\nPlease share your first code stories. And share your advice for a green tech to do better.",

Since school starts August 1st (3 weeks away)\n- I have like nothing, not even a syllabus. But I do have some classroom management planning done and some rules written down. But that's about it.\n\nI just feel like I don't know what I should be preparing for, and having limited time to do it is starting to worry me. I know I have 3 weeks left, one of which will be my new teacher orientation and scheduled teacher work days; however, I don't like sitting here twiddling my thumbs.\n\nI have a student version of the Springboard text I will be using, as well as copies of three novels that the department supposedly uses for World Lit Classes.

    "text": "How to move into a Data Science \\Business Intelligence Role when I might get fired or laid off in my current role? I was hired as a business analyst out of school with a data analyst side (Python, SQL, Tableau) at an Indian IT consulting company. My plan was to move into analytics but my company put me on bench as soon as I was hired. Unfortunately, my company did not need me as a business analyst or data analyst and instead moved into epic (electronic health record) consultant for Professional billing (medical coding) since January. I had no healthcare background coming in and I struggled with learning epic more than learning other technologies such as statistical programming or SQL querying. I don't enjoy healthcare, I hate epic, but I try to do the best job I can. All my coworkers except one (who was a software engineer) have at least 5 years epic professional billing experience and some have been working in healthcare IT for close to 20 years. We recently got a new client manager and she's getting rid of contractors like myself right and left and is hiring experienced FTE's. \n\nThe new client manager  put me on a Process improvement plan because she doesn't think I'm problem-solving complex issues fast enough independently. I don't have the primary  Epic Professional billing certification only the secondary certifications(claims and remit), lack the medical coding domain knowledge, and to make matters worse epic pays millions of dollars so nothing is googleable making finding answers hard. My new manager told me she is not looking for a junior analyst, she doesn't trust me to do a good job on any complex problem, and I think she been gathering evidence to fire me. The evidence she gathers is weak (for example I didn't respond to a group email within 20 minutes while I was in integrated testing) but because she is my client manager my company will let me go she complains to them.  I can do the basic in epic but there is so much to learn and the documentation is terrible. I'm not sure if I could do a complex project in epic without guidance from other team members.\n\nI have never enjoyed my current project or role but my company won't let me switch projects or roles. My client manager is actively looking to get me get me fired in the next few months.  \n\nI'm applying to as many Tableau Developer, Data Analyst, and Data scientist roles as I can but I am not hearing back very often because of my lack of analytics experience. I only have some summer internships as real-world analytics experience (Tableau and SQL) experience. I completed an online data science bootcamp with Python, do weekly Tableau public challenges, attend meetups, and spend hours learning each week on personal development. I did a good job at gathering requirements, dealing with stakeholders,and testing in my current role and I think I would also be  a good business analyst. \n\nI think after I'm done with integrated testing for my team my manager is going to fire me. \nI worried that if I get fired before I find a new job that I am going to struggle to landing the next position. Should I resign so can say I wasn't fired? I've never been fired before so I don't know the full effect of the stigma? Not a lot of people are hiring during the holidays. Does anyone know any resources or metro areas to look for jobs? I'm willing to relocate to almost anywhere in the USA and I'm single.",

    "text": "Career Advancement Advice: leaving current employer after 2 years? Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m looking for a bit of input, perhaps those with a few more years professional experience can draw from their time in the work force and offer a bit of insight. First some background: ~6 years ago I’d broken into my industry as a sales associate. Having experienced a fair amount of success, advanced in ~3 years time to the manager level at a second employer, where I have been for the last 2+ years.\n\nFast forward to today; I’ve received an offer to join a multinational generic pharmaceutical manufacturer at the Associate Director level, with a fairly substantial bump in pay. \n\nI’m weighing the pros and cons of leaving my current employer, a European based manufacturer, a brilliant group of scientists/engineers/support staff, and joining a new company. In terms of career progression and future earnings potential, I believe this is the right move. Looking ahead, it is likely that I return to school for an MBA, and believe the progression will show well in the application process as well.\n\nI certainly know what I’d like to hear from the group … but I’m open to hearing other opinions, especially any which are dissenting. Implications of moving from one company to another in a relatively short period of time? Am I right to assume this is a symptom of today's job market? Is the clear jump in pay, responsibility and title justification enough? I wonder how far loyalty would take me in my current role.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Personal Info**\n\n* Age: 28 years old\n* Male\n* Single, no dependents \n\n**Employer A (current)**\n\n* Pharmaceutical Drug Substance and Fine Chemical manufacturer headquartered in Europe.\n* Account Manager with responsibilities in North America\n* Base Salary: $85,000/yr\n* Bonus Potential: 15-20%\n* Additional: $5k/yr car allowance, preventative maintenance and insurance paid\n* Work from home office when not on the road.

    "text": "5 Years of experience across 3 jobs, bored out of my mind and I don't know how to get somewhere I might be happy. [Long] I worked for about 1.5 years (including my internship) for a tiny shop writing custom software for other small, local businesses. I was solely responsible for DB, UI, and everything in between for Win Forms applications. For the most part this entailed making custom modifications to our \"main product\" for specific customers. My least favorite part of this job (aside from the pay) was dealing directly with the clients.\n\nAfter that, I spent another 1.5 years doing more win forms development for an international bank. For the first few months this job was great, my manager was insanely knowledgeable about .NET and I was learning a lot. Then he was forcefully moved to another project and before long I got laid off (was a contract employee, company was slashing its IT budget and opened two offices in China).\n\nThe last 2.5 years, I've been developing (or rather, maintaining) an ASP.NET application for a small/medium sized company which services a large industry. It is a very mature application that existed since the late 90's / early 00's. Originally it was a desktop application, then the company paid an Indian firm to rewrite it as an IE-only ASP application. Just after I started here, we paid them to rewrite it again as an MVC application and browser independent. The code quality isn't great.\n\nMy current job is the first job I've ever had where I really like my coworkers. The benefits are insanely good, and while I'd like more pay it's certainly a comfortable wage for my area.\n\nThe problem is is that it's very stagnant. There government does mandate new changes that must be added each year, but it's basically just \"Add X new screens to track some new fields\". Other than that, it's bug fixes and random small side projects. I'm not *learning* anything. There is rarely a task or project I look forward to.\n\nI've always liked the *idea* of getting into game development, but I suspect I'd actually be miserable doing it and the few companies that I would want to work for... Well, I have zero experience in the languages / tools they use.\n\nI also like the idea of working with some sort of machinery or robotics, but I don't have the experience with any low-level languages and I'm not good at complex math.\n\nI think I just need a job where every year or two I'll be doing something new, something different. But does a job like that even exist?\n\nBetween working full time, a very high energy dog consuming a good amount of my spare time, and a social life I don't have a ton of time or energy for learning new skills outside of work so I don't really know how I can broaden my horizons.\n\nI try to tell myself this company has an insanely generous retirement package, great health insurance, and a low turnover rate so I should just shut up and milk it... But it's not a rewarding job, and aside from the MVC rewrite which introduced some actual architecture and new-to-me JS libraries which were fun to learn there is never a project a I look forward to.\n\nAny ideas on how I could possibly go about expanding my opportunities?",

    "text": "Unsure about the normality of my situation - looking for other perspectives Summary: A little over 1 year into career. Joined second company in July. Increasingly met with demands that we don't seem to have resources for.\n\nIt's a small company of around 50 employees. I'm in a team of 4 devs - one senior at the office, two offshore, senior Indian developers. We're part of a data team consisting of 10 people, excluding management.\n When I first joined it was partly due to displaying a desire to help improve the qualities of the processes in the company. Things such as improving architecture, documentations, anything I could get my hands on essentially. I learned that the company hit a bit of a rough patch a few months before my joining as a big customer wasn't as active anymore. \n\nWe had a monthly team meeting, where an officer/executive particpated. He gave some information about plans for the company that left a lot of people on the team in doubt about what he meant, and the future of their position in the company. On top of this there was already a bit of dark mood due to a horrible COO scaring away all sales talent, which isn't helping.\n\nIt's starting to feel lonely at the company, because I increasingly run into things like..\n\n- None of Indian devs participating in team chats. They seem to pretend like they just don't see any messages I send, when I have question about a framework they've been pushing, and when they do answer it's unhelpful short sentences. Nobody hears from them outside of daily scrums unless they have problems themselves.\n\n- Senior dev is also busy, and constantly getting interrupted by other people. He's always very kind and helpful though, but I don't think he enjoys it too much.\n\n- Every developer is working in isolation on different projects. I've suggested code reviews/pair programming to help collaborate more, and manager has said it would be great. It never happened though. I can never get anybody to look at my commits, and nobody else is requesting code reviews or pair programming.\n\n- I have to write all my JIRA tasks on my own, which takes a lot of time in itself, and nobody checks, if they actually match with the expected sprint goals or what's been requested to be done.\n\nOther frustrations include resources and that our manager has been going on about security. We deal with a lot of sensitive data, so that seems like a good recourse. Problems here are...\n\n- He's mandated that we have three layers of security across 3 servers. We have no test setup or production environment, because it's too expensive.\n\n- I've been prevented from deploying other finished tasks, because we can't afford the servers that he wants them on. One of our analysts was pulling his hair out, when I told him that I hadn't been able to deploy some data that he'd been promised, because the deployment server hadn't been ordered for budgetting reasons. Literally just wasted effort at this point, which seems very expensive for an already hurting company.\n\n- I set up a Jenkins server to build, test and deploy from our Git server, but I wasn't allowed to deploy it as we don't have a secure server for it. So instead developers still manually have to log on virtual servers to deploy.\n\n- I'm currently preparing the next version of our web application for launch. Nobody in management seems to have any idea where the hell is being done on it, and tasks are poorly defined for it. Two weeks ago my manager gave me a brief talking to, because I'd agreed on a short term solution with the other senior dev on how this new web application should communicate with a service until our manager had specified exactly what should be done, because he wanted the final vote in this. The problem was related to a lack of overall architecture in the company's software, so I spent two of my weekends, while manager was on vacation, on coming up with a solution that would solve a bunch of other related problems as well as the current problem. I wrote it into a document along with spending a lot time in making some neat looking diagrams. I was proud of it, and senior dev said it looked nice and possible to do. Manager came home from vacation, and called me and senior dev into meeting, when I brought up the problem. He immediately said he hadn't read the document, asked me to explain on whiteboard instead. He ended up respectfully saying it was a waste of time, and told us to go with the solution that he'd originally scolded me for, because my proposed solution wasn't adding value.\n\nI don't know. I feel like this could be a situation, where my job is in danger. I feel incompetent, and I feel discouraged that a lot of my work has gone out of the window, because there aren't resources for the necessary hardware to deploy it on. I fear that somebody from management could walk in any day, and say that our team or I am being made redundant, because the company wants to go in a different direction. I'd have to find my third job within 1½ years then, and I'm not sure anybody would be interested in hiring me. \n\nIs this situation or similar situations normal? How would you deal with it? I have a 1 on 1 with my manager this Monday. Wondering how smart it would be to bring it up there.\n\nSorry for the longwinded post, I'm anxious and couldn't sleep, so I figured I'd try posting here. Thanks in advance for any help or advice.",

    "text": "Worried about my future. Need advice. Not American, but need advice. I graduated from a not very good school a little over a year ago as a software developer. I took a job at a small company straight away, where I was really miserable.\n\n I found another job, which I started in July. It was a huge change. Friendly people, more professional, much more interesting work. It has 50 employees, but is 15 years old, and only within the last few years has worked towards having a real development team. The development team is currently a senior dev, two off-shore Indian devs and myself. They're all around 40 or 50 and very skilled from what I can tell. The senior dev is a fantastic person and always super helpful. So why am I worried?\n\nThe company is in a bit of an odd state right now. It was doing great right up until around the time that I was employed, where it'd been through a merger, and lost a significant client, which was, from my understanding, inevitable.\n\nI think I was hired for a few reasons. The criteria they stated to be critical during the job interviews were that the candidate should be able to understand content of the work and should be enthusiastic about taking the company to the next level in terms of code quality, version control etc., which I definitely am. So I was very happy to take the offer when it came.\n\nReality hasn't turned out that way exactly. The first month was very slow. My boss was away on vacation for the first two weeks, and they'd only prepared two tasks for me, which were done in two days. Also none of the code base was under version control, so I spent a few days uploading all the different projects. It was tedious work, since there were several copies from different developers of many of the projects. After that I was scrounging for anything to do. In the following months, I've been given a lot tasks I would consider to be not very interesting. For example, a misunderstanding from my boss meant that we received an entire web application from an outsourced developer in SQL Server, and I had to spend a week simply translating all the data access.\n\nToday I was invited by our COO along with the senior developer to a meeting with him about a task from a new, big client, which the company sorely needs. I was happy at first until the senior dev told me, he'd asked the COO to invite me too, which isn't the first time. It worries me, because I'm starting to see a pattern of all the critical tasks going to senior dev - everybody values his input including me - while I'm receiving these tasks that don't have much to do with getting into and learning the core of the company's software that it relies on. So at this point, I feel like I'm just there to take assignments, which would distract the senior dev from doing more valuable work. That's fair enough, but it worries me that I have to work on all these other tasks in different projects, when what I really wanted was to get to work alongside him on these more interesting tasks. Currently all devs are just sitting on their own, in their own projects. I'm not very happy with it, I miss actively working on the same code base with someone the same way I did as a student.\n\nMy manager and I had a conversation to assert how it was going after the first 2½ months. He said I was doing exceptionally and surpassing all his expectations, which I was really happy about. I laid out my concern with not working on the more complex tasks. He claimed I was already doing some decently complex work in some of the tasks I was doing, and that I shouldn't worry, because those tasks would come with time. For some reason I don't trust that statement. I'm generally just worried that I'm not smart or skilled enough to be accepted as someone who can work on these tasks.\n\nFurthermore I spent a bunch of my free time doing things like setting up automatic build and deployment, because deployment is currently done by compiling on the developers machine, remoting into one of our servers and copy pasting the .exe file there. My manager was very excited about this, specifically because he'd had a headache regarding the Indian devs not being legally allowed to work with customers data, so this could solve that problem. The problem here is that the budget is closed, and he insists on setting up the build and deployment server on its own separate server. So all that work is null and avoid. It was a bit of a hit considering how important he'd stated it was to improve the quality of the company's software development.\n\nMost people could probably go on like this for a while about things that bother them in the workplace. I think what bothers me the most is that I feel depressed and worried that I'm not smart enough to actually get to work on anything interesting anywhere. I've been considering multiple ways of improving myself. Lately I've been solving a Leetcode problem per night and trying to combine personal interests and improving professionally by learning about crypto currencies. I also generally try to read about proper software design, and smart ways to make a lot of tedious work easier. I've also been thinking about going back and studying at a better school or joining meetups. I feel like if I'm this exhausted just trying to become a mediocre developer that can get to work on more interesting tasks than some of the things I'm currently doing, what are my chances really then of ever getting to work on something I find to be interesting?",

    "text": "Burnt my bridges with an employer who was narcissistic, egotistic AND didn't pay my overtime wages. Tl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court. \n\nStory starts back in 2015. I had been working part time at numerous jobs for 2 ½ years at this point (after having been full time for a while) and was incredibly frustrated with the lack of income. Some of the jobs I held down would go from giving me 39 hours a week to less than 5 hours, and while I had the support of my husband to keep us afloat, I couldn’t stand not being able to financially provide. So when I interviewed for a corporate but franchised owned hotel, I was ecstatic. This establishment, of which we’ll nickname Vacation Hotel, was a little franchised, family owned hotel that seemed fantastic to work for. I distinctly remember leaving the interview thinking “WOW. I want to work there!!”\n\nIt’s funny, because looking back on it, every employee who came and left had thought the same thing. And boy, did this hotel have more turnover then they let on. The manager – who we’ll name Kyle – had the same charm in all his interviews. He put on a damn good show, so good no one could see how fake it was. He did, after all, go to law school – and the more you got to know him, the easier it was to tell. \n\nKyle had charm. He spoke about how he treated each and every employee he had like family, so much so that he had leant a former employee money for a new car after they had been in an accident.  This was a story he told in every one of his interviews, though you wouldn’t know it at first. He spoke about how he hated large corporations and would treat his employees like humans, not robots. He’d even “randomly give raises” when he saw good performance, instead of waiting for annual reviews. I not only remember these things from my interview, but I began to watch him interview more and more people during my year there…of which, he gave the same speech with the same genuine realness. \nKyle became one of the biggest frauds I’d ever dealt with. Narcissistic and egotistic aren’t words that do his behavior justice. And it took me some time to accept that. Because him and his family “treated” everyone like they were, indeed, family. You fell for it, and you began to do everything you could for them. You felt obligated to be the best employee you can for such a “great and kind boss” who would give you the shirt off his back. Kyle always found a way to rope you in – he didn’t explain in his interviews that working full time did NOT mean you got benefits, in fact I saw many people assume it like I did. No health care, no time off, nothing. You worked for your hourly wage and that was it. This was one of the biggest bummers to me shortly after starting, as I had wished he told me up front in the interview. The second biggest bummer was when he explained he “did not budget for overtime.” No one could give me an answer to how he got away with this. I considered asking him, but I let it go.\n\nYou see, Kyle promised me big things. He was opening another hotel. And after having a 2 ½ year stint of struggling to find work, the idea of a stable career made me ecstatic. Kyle promised me a salary, a positon, and a future. While deep in my heart I had no desire for the hotel business, money does talk. And the numbers he showed me said a lot – it said stability. So Kyle ensured me I’d be experiencing all of this; money, stability, a career – if I showed my worth. He wasn’t “just going to hand it” to me until I showed I was capable. While most employers will promote you and then train you, Kyle did things backwards. He’d train and then promote. Why? Kyle was a penny pitcher. “Why pay me the salary if I don’t know what I’m doing?” and “It’ll catch up to you in the end, you’ll be making more money than you can dream of.” \n\nI fell for it. Kyle did things to make you want to stay – he’d act like he cared for you. He gave multiple employees loans when they fell short on money, though I refused to fall into it. But hell, I did get into a situation where my husband and I wanted to rent somewhere else but our credit was too damaged to get a place, so he called a potential landlord and recommended me for the townhouse we now live in. I was grateful for that, but never let it tie me down. I didn’t ask for it, he was kind enough to do it for me. And while he did a wonderful favor, I know in my heart I would get by without him. \n\nRegardless, I started training with the measly hourly income that every other front desk employee got. I was doing the work of Director of Sales for the hotel, Housekeeping Management, and accounting. It was becoming exhausting, and as Kyle was beginning to open that other hotel – guaranteeing I would be the general manager – I began to look for other work during my free time. I really didn’t want the job anymore. But I soaked up the experience from him until I left.\n\nThe biggest downfall from Kyle was two things.  Number 1 – I began to see that he had a major anger problem. He was a perfectionist. Something told me it had something to do with his nationality of being Indian, and how his father who owned the hotel would scrutinize him for the smallest mistake. Mistakes were NOT allowed at his hotel. Not the smallest, itty bitty mistake. If one of his bills was overcharged by $2, and I paid that amount, he’d go full Hulk on me. The yelling from him started to kill my confidence. My fellow co-workers began to notice how exhausted, tired and stressed I was becoming. I let them know that I was always walking on eggshells, no mistake was allowed during my shift. If it happened, he’d shout and yell at you like you were child, using words like “stupid” and “dumb” – and he wouldn’t pull you into his office, he’d do it publicly. \n\nNumber 2 – Kyle didn’t follow the law. It wasn’t “in his budget” to pay overtime. He felt he could reward his employees with random bonuses (of which never truly happened) as opposed to paying the dues owed. In my “training” it was a requirement to work 45-55 hours a week, 6 days a week.  I didn’t receive a cent of that in overtime, just my hourly wage. I also found out very quickly how heavily taxed you are in pay when you work over 40 hours.  So the extra $100 or so I was “making” a week really came out to be $20 or so after taxes. When I asked not to work over 40 hours, suddenly it wasn’t allowed. I would be stripped of my titles because a “real manager works as hard and as long as they need to.” And I would need to get used to “working 60-80 hours a week if needed.” This was all fine and dandy, but if I was working these hours, I wanted the right pay. He made it clear it wasn’t happening. “All would be paid in due time.” So while Kyle went on multiple trips – London, India, Las Vegas, New York – I managed the hotel. I did his job for him, of which he made clear that I was doing as much. At first it was appealing to be an acting general manager…until it wore me down.\n\nIt wasn’t until a fellow co-worker sat me down and told me up front about how she felt regarding the situation. I was shocked to hear her say she felt I was being used, abused and mistreated. But I agreed with her. She was looking for work, I was looking for work – we both wanted out. I still did my job, but stopped caring very quickly. As the rose colored glasses fell of completely, I saw him mistreat and abuse others. Inside the establishment that seemed so fantastic was really an ugly family who used their employees to gain profit. \n\nI can’t say I would have left when I did if it weren’t for my husband’s accident. In autumn of 2016, he got into a terrible motorcycle accident. He was flown to shock trauma and spent 4 days there, having needed surgery on his arm and knee. Of course I immediately called out of my next shift, but later that day as I waited for his surgery to take place; Kyle kept blowing up my phone asking when I’d be back and if I could return the next day for work. After all, Kyle’s wife (who also worked at the hotel) was newly pregnant and stopped working immediately. So he “needed” me there to “run” the hotel. He didn’t like the answer I had for him – I needed time off. Not having benefits for such a thing, he made it seem like a requirement to return to work. As I had already been losing my patience with him, this became the last straw. Just like I distinctly remember my interview with him, it was the moment in the hospital waiting room that I distinctly remember making a life alternating decision – my family came first. And if that meant being there but not providing thousands of dollars, I would take it. I couldn’t imagine having to rush back to a freaking hotel instead of being with my injured husband, all because the housekeepers needed help. While that was his life, it wasn’t the life for me.\n\nNot even 5 weeks after his accident did I find another job and put in my resignation. I held out until I found a job with benefits, so I could stop paying an arm and leg to the Afford Care Act. I sent him an email, wrote him a hand written letter, and gave him 2 weeks notice. I was hoping to part peacefully, but that wish never came true. A couple days later I was pulled into his office and he spent an hour convincing me of why I needed to stay and everything I’d be giving up (it was always money with Kyle) if I left. I stayed firm, even as he promised an immediate raise and large bonus in my next paycheck. He promised to pay my health care from the ACA and even start giving me vacation time. Having told him three times my answer was final; I was then berated for a period of time that I can’t even remember. It was almost surely a half an hour that he told me I was going to fail in life, that I’d go nowhere – especially without him, and I’d never get such a great opportunity like he had given me. \n\nIt was in that moment, I knew I made the right choice.\nWe left on civil terms, regardless of how he treated me during that moment. I kept in touch – hell, I even did a Saturday or two in shifts for him while I started my new job. And then I filed a complaint with the Department of Labor for unpaid overtime wages. Per the DOL, you have to request the unpaid wages first before you take the employer to court. So I wrote up a letter, calculated from my pay stubs the amount I was owed, and certified mailed it to him. \n\nI heard back the day he received the letter. 13 text messages blew up my phone at once, all about how he was such a great friend to me, how dare I do such a thing, I willing worked those hours, I have no right to “steal” this money from him, how he helped me get the house I live in and how I’d regret my decision to send that letter. \n\nKyle was smart. Kyle knew that if he didn’t pay me what I asked for, it’d go to court and he’d owed hundreds of thousands of dollars to all his other employees who were owed unpaid overtime. It was better for him to pay what I was owed as opposed to everyone else. My response was civil – I quoted the FSLA and once again requested only what I was owed in unpaid overtime. He said he’d have a check for me in a couple days with payroll, and would mail it to me as I requested.  \n\nI was hoping that would be it for us. He’d send his check and we’d call it a burnt bridge. Instead, that Friday that he was going to mail it, he showed up at my doorstep. For 5 minutes he banged on the door like a primal animal – I was upstairs taking a nap and my husband was downstairs, quite frankly, ignoring it. I’ll be honest, we really don’t answer the door unless we know we’re expecting guest, as we get a lot of solicitors in our neighborhood. It wasn’t until I was woken up by my phone blowing up – it was Kyle, saying he was outside and if I wanted the check, I needed to open the door.\n\nF. That. Sh!t. He wasn’t coming into my safe space, my HOME, to berate and abuse me. I wouldn’t allow it. I knew from experience what would happen, as I had seen him withhold employee’s last paychecks until they came to pick it up when he was at the hotel so he could put them down and call them horrible, stupid people. He wasn’t going to do that in my home. I asked my husband to deal with him. According to him, it was hard to get the check – not because he was my husband and not the person the check was addressed to, but rather Kyle kept trying to pass on messages through him. \n\n“Tell her we could have done this face to face, and it’s a shame she had to let it come to this, and that she’s a coward, she’ll never go anywhere, ect ect.” Not hearing it, my husband told him to keep his business out of our home and to hand the check over or leave.\n\nAt the end of the day, I got my owed wages. I know I came out on top, though I’m greatly angered that Kyle tried to invade my personal space at home with his petty anger. I’ve learned a great lesson from this experience, and feel like a much better person after it all. I’ll no longer give all of myself to any employer, no matter what they promise me or even what they pay me. If I can’t divide my time between my personal life and my job, I need to step away from the latter. Because life is too short to spend my entire day away from the things I truly love. A job is a job, but my family is my life. \n\nTl;dr – Former employer turned out to be scum and even refused to pay overtime wages until I threatened to take him to court.",

    "text": "Career Advancement Advice: leaving current employer after 2 years? Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m looking for a bit of input, perhaps those with a few more years professional experience can draw from their time in the work force and offer a bit of insight. First some background: ~6 years ago I’d broken into my industry as a sales associate. Having experienced a fair amount of success, advanced in ~3 years time to the manager level at a second employer, where I have been for the last 2+ years.\n\nFast forward to today; I’ve received an offer to join a multinational generic pharmaceutical manufacturer at the Associate Director level, with a fairly substantial bump in pay. \n\nI’m weighing the pros and cons of leaving my current employer, a European based manufacturer, a brilliant group of scientists/engineers/support staff, and joining a new company. In terms of career progression and future earnings potential, I believe this is the right move. Looking ahead, it is likely that I return to school for an MBA, and believe the progression will show well in the application process as well.\n\nI certainly know what I’d like to hear from the group … but I’m open to hearing other opinions, especially any which are dissenting. Implications of moving from one company to another in a relatively short period of time? Am I right to assume this is a symptom of today's job market? Is the clear jump in pay, responsibility and title justification enough? I wonder how far loyalty would take me in my current role.\n\nThanks!\n\n**Personal Info**\n\n* Age: 28 years old\n* Male\n* Single, no dependents \n\n**Employer A (current)**\n\n* Pharmaceutical Drug Substance and Fine Chemical manufacturer headquartered in Europe.\n* Account Manager with responsibilities in North America\n* Base Salary: $85,000/yr\n* Bonus Potential: 15-20%\n* Additional: $5k/yr car allowance, preventative maintenance and insurance paid\n* Work from home office when not on the road. Travel required to Portugal 2x per year, totaling ~4 weeks in Europe, in addition to regional business travel\n* Ceiling in terms of advancement\n\n**Employer B**\n\n* Pharmaceutical Drug Substance, Drug Product and Fine Chemical manufacturer headquartered in India\n* Associate Director, API Sales, with responsibilities in North America\n* Base Salary: $110,000/yr\n* Bonus Potential: 15%\n* Additional: $9k/yr car allowance\n* 100 mile round trip commute\n* Ranked among top three Indian drug manufacturers, with a number of verticals for future advancement \n* Will be responsible for new product selection and higher level of oversight in day-to-day sales operations",

    "text": "No full-time job for 4+ years, why? *EDIT:* Not long after submitting this post, several life changes happened. \n \n1. I finally landed a DevOps engineering internship with full benefits. \n2. I left the internship, despite positive encouragement stay from the VP of engineering, my manager, and peers, to pursue completing my education. (Who also positively encouraged my goal of education.)\n3. I was accepted at an internationally recognized university into their (software) engineering program. \n4. I began volunteering my (previously ignored, except for my internship) expertise for a positive cause. \n5. I landed a remote, part-time job (with full benefits!) as a software engineer which enables me to be employed, build my resume, and go to university. \n\nI learned that: \n \n1. It truly is darkest before the dawn. (I seriously considered suicide, and only didn't because it wouldn't financially benefit my family. I'm glad I didn't.) \n2. Sometimes all it takes is gathering the courage to ask a bunch of people to give you a chance, because all you need is one chance and one person to believe in you long enough to prove yourself. \n3. Don't give up. Do what's right, even if you don't see results for years. \n4. Do what works, do what works, do what works -- do what works for you and stop looking for hidden advice and listening to gurus.\n5. Find a mentor. If you can't, invent one. (ie, If no mentor, then be your own mentor and challenge yourself.) \n6. Find a cheap hobby that is something which you haven't done before, that you can share. (I picked card/ring magic.)\n7. Finally, stop knocking on closed doors, move on. (I left Austin, TX.)\n\n-----\n\nAs the title says, four years passed since my lay-off, and I have yet to find a full-time job. I'm aware there are others in a similar boat. I was unexpectedly laid off a week after I married in 2013, and have never quite recovered financially or otherwise. My wife has been a saint, but I think it's finally starting to cause her too much pain, mainly because we don't understand why I'm such a pariah to potential employers. (And living in limbo near the poverty line sucks.) What do I need to change to be considered worth hiring?\n\nI *think* I'm qualified for at least an entry-level full-time job, but despite what is now about 2000+ job applications (not an exaggeration), I number somewhere around ten phone interviews, and one in person interview. I don't apply to jobs which I don't meet necessary qualifications, or where my experience doesn't fit.\n\nMy primary and most current bullet points are:\n\n* One year of iOS development experience, through Udacity\n* C++ certificate from a 30 credit hour program\n* AAS in Computer Programming\n* AA in Arabic\n* Eight total years of active duty in the military\n* Three years in Special Operations intelligence\n* Administrative and project management experience\n\nI think the biggest strikes against me are:\n\n* No bachelor degree\n* Inactive security clearance\n\nAnd last, but not least:\n\n* A seemingly disjointed career so far: infantry > Arabic linguist > special operations > government contractor > unemployed > full-time student & part-time job > Google contractor (technically part-time temp, working 70 hr/wk) > unemployment > part-time job & full-time student\n\nBecause I've lived on, or below, the poverty line for about the last five years, my debt to income ratio isn't stellar, yet I've managed to retain a good credit score, and I do not have a criminal background/record or otherwise.\n\nMy friends often compliment me, saying I'm \"one of the smartest people they know.\" However, the proof isn't in the pudding, and I think my wife is about to divorce me because I'm poor, with no job in sight... And it's just painful. A $600 car repair sets us back months. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? What's right?",

    "text": "I lost my leg when I could of lost my life I just realized that today is Feb 16.. I don't post about this date a lot because it happened so long ago, but it was a very traumatic day for so many in the Arab area..\nToday 22 years ago I was 9 years old. My mother dropped me off at my daddy's house because she was leaving early the next morning to go to St. Judes hospital in Memphis with my grandmother and my aunt Kyndra, who was battling meduloblastoma, a brain cancer. I was angry she wouldn't let me skip school and go with her and as I got out of the car at my dad's, instead of a goodbye I looked at her and said \"I hope something happens so you can't go tomorrow\"... These would become words that would terrorize me in the years to come, as I tried to make my child-self believe I hadn't 'caused' the deaths and destruction that was to come. \nAt around 5 a.m. I was awoken by the sounds of debris hitting my bedroom walls. I had no idea what was happening and, if you know me, you know it had to be pretty dang loud to wake me up. I got out of bed and looked out the window. The still dark, winter sky was lit up with lightning and an orange haze, but right in the middle was a swirling mass of gray tornado. I was still sleepy, but I remember a shot of adrenaline pumping through me and all I could think was \"i have to get to Logan\".. Logan, my not even year old baby brother, asleep in the bedroom adjoining mine. The rain and hail and debris was so loud now I could barely hear anything, but I ran down the short hallway to his room and when I got to the doorway it seemed as if he was floating above the mattress in his crib (I'm still unsure if this happened or if it was my imagination, but further research did prove that the vacuum created by a tornado could have possibly caused enough suction to make this real). I turned and saw my daddy run out of his room towards us at the opposite end of the trailer and then the world flipped upside down... Like, literally, I remember seeing the trailer tear in two down the kitchen and my head hit the ceiling as our end of the trailer, along with me and my baby brother, were swept into the funnel cloud right in front of my daddy's eyes. \nI dont remember much of what came next, I faded in and out of consciousness for what seemed like ages, but in actuality was probably only seconds. Every time I awoke all around me was swirling, gray mass and the wind was so loud, tearing at my face and hair before I blissfully passed back out.  \nWhen I finally awoke for good I was alone. My 9 year old, childlike eyes took in the destruction surrounding me.. It seemed as if the debris, piled so high around me was as tall as skyscrapers, silhouetted against the night sky lit up with so many flashes of lightning... The stillness was absolute. No sounds were around me and I feared so much that I was the only one left. As I sat there, trying to process the destruction, I didn't know what I know now, that I had actually been INSIDE the funnel cloud and it had thrown me roughly 100 yards from where my bedroom was, and deposited me in the middle of a cow pasture. I remember only one thought passing through my head in those moments, I had to get to my daddy. To my daddy, who could fix anything, make anything okay again and everything alright.. I had to find my daddy. So I stood up, took a step, and fell. I sat there in the mud puddle in which I had landed, and stood up again. Took a step, and fell.. I repeated this process for who knows how long, all the while yelling out the only word I could think of \"Daddy..\"  And then finally standing on a rise in front of me, in the stillness and silence with only lightning and debris for company, I saw him. He was dark, a shadow, silhouetted against that flashing night sky, but I knew him immediately.. My daddy was there.\nHe ran to me and on his face was a mixture of emotions I've never been able to put name to. Terror, relief, joy, fear.. A literal miasma of conflicting expressions as he looked at me. He pulled off his belt from his jeans and tied it tight around the top of my thigh, I couldn't stop staring at him. I didn't even know why he was doing that, I mean, I wasn't hurt, but in that moment it didn't matter, my daddy was here- I would be okay. \nHe gently lifted me in his arms and carried me over the rise where I had initially seen him. I saw my step mom and she was sitting, crying. No baby brother. Where was Logan? My daddy sat me so carefully on the water heater, the only warm thing around on that cold, February morning. The sun still wasn't up, and at some point after finding my daddy, the rain had started. I began to become aware of things like how good the heat felt on the backs of my thighs, how I was trembling in my t-shirt and panties as the rain poured down on us. Slowly, my world was coming in to focus.. \nAs I sat there, listening to my dad and step mom frantically try and form a plan about how to find Logan I was overcome with tiredness... So I leaned over to put my head in between my knees, with my forearms on top of my thighs... Except my right forearm didn't go on top of my thigh... It went IN to my thigh. \nI felt the meat from the inside of my leg brush along my outer arm as I looked down in amazement.. I felt no pain, no hurt, nothing.. But this, this was why I couldn't walk, this was why I couldn't take a step! This was why my daddy's belt was wrapped so tightly around the top of my thigh! How had I not noticed it before?! The shock of the moment overtook me, and I began to scream, yet again for my daddy.. \nHe comforted me, I remember few of his words, other than they had the intended effect of soothing me. He once again picked me up in his arms and carried me... Across debris, wood, metal, the remnants of our home, our neighbors homes, our lives. Across live electrical wires in pouring down rain, he carried me across the road to a neighbor whose house was untouched. As he sat me on her cold concrete porch and the chill seeped into the backs of my thighs, he banged on the door and pled for help for his child, the only child he knew was alive at that moment. \nShe came out and brought me in, an hour later the ambulance managed to pick its way to us, but my daddy was still searching for my brother. They took me to the hospital and waited until my mother could find a way through the wreckage of the roads to get there to sign emergency surgery papers, before whisking me back and sewing up my thigh. \nIt was bad, much worse than I realized. My femur was exposed (and bones inside you are more gray than white btw😉) with my femoral artery only being missed by little over a centimeter. It cut me from knee to hip, wide open on the inside of my leg. I had just a bit under 400 stitches and 30+ staples. I still carry the scar, along with the memories, to this day. It has become a part of me, who I am, I barely notice it anymore.. Although it is one of the first things most people see, especially in summer with shorts. \nI would stay in the hospital for 22 days and my brother would be found a few hours later. The miracle baby, he was called, missing for hours after a horrible F4 tornado tore his home apart.. Not even a year old sitting perfectly sheltered, dry, not a scratch on him.. Like an angel built him a tent to wait out the storm. To wait for our daddy.\nWe were so blessed. Three people lost their lives that morning. We know it could have been us, but although not quite unscathed, we still emerged. We rebuilt, moved on with our lives, and we have never forgotten how quickly your life can change. Tornadoes in life can come so quickly. In the 22 years since, I have learned many things, been through many more trials and tribulations, but this was the first real test of my young life. I learned that  you should watch your words, even when you're angry.. Because you never know the kind of aftermath you will deal with if they prove true. I learned you can push through if you are determined enough, no matter how much mud, muck and pain tries to pull you back down. And I learned that you can always, always count on your Daddy to come for you if you call to Him.",

    "text": "Not sure how to feel about coworkers talking in another language to the extent that it feels exclusionary. Can someone please help me understand if I am in the wrong? Hello,\nI work in a Japanese-American Company. I work with 5 other people in the same office. All of us are in the same department in an open-office environment. The assistant manager and two of the other purchasing agents speak Japanese (one from the US and one from Japan). Conversations in Japanese are very common. Until recently, the last few weeks, it has never bothered me. I have worked here for almost a year now. One of the agents and the assistant manager have been having conversations in Japanese throughout the entire day lately, and I have been finding it more and more exclusionary. I understand wanting to talk in your native language because I can speak French, but I prefer English given the choice. However, both of them have lived in the US for 20 years and are nearly as fluent in English as I am. The worst part of this is I can’t pinpoint why this has been bothering me. They have had conversations in Japanese the entire time I have worked here. A lot of their conversations in Japanese are about issues our department/company is facing, and because they don’t have these conversations in English anymore, I know far less about what is going on than I used to. I know that their conversations dip into their personal lives, and I am actually okay with this part. However, I have noticed a growing rift between the US workers who only speak English (excluding me) and the 2 Japanese employees. They have gotten to where they barely ever talk to each other, and they don’t really respect each other. The Manager of our department being one of those English speakers has made this situation even more annoying. Also, I think it has been bothering me because my own workload has been steadily increasing as theirs seems to be decreasing, according to how much they talk and not work (note:  they also pass a lot of their work to me). I mean these conversations have lasted all day (while they were in the office), and they don’t really do anything else while they talked.\nAlso, I want to show that I am not just bothered by the use of foreign languages. I have friends from several different nations, and when we get together, we talk in several different languages together.  Most of these friends speak languages I do not know, and it is fine.  For example, we’ll be having a conversation and someone will say something in Arabic, then someone will kind of explain to the non-Arabic speakers what was said if anyone seems curious. Another example, a group of Spanish and English spearkers, and French and English speakers talking in all three languages together. The Spanish and the French can be loosely understood by both groups due to similarities, so English is used when people are unsure of the exact translation or when someone wants to be sure everyone understands what they say. Two of my friends may say something to each other in their mutual language and not explain it to the group because it was an obvious aside and not really important to the whole group. Or even a work example, our department is all talking together, and there will be both Japanese and English in the conversation but everything is being explained to everyone involved. These are the sorts of situations I am used to, and I have no problems with them because everything is out in the open if need be. There may be languages being used that don’t get explained, but it isn’t something that is important. \nSo, their conversations have been distracting for a multitude of reasons, and I am not certain how I feel or how I should feel. I want to work for the UN one day, so I feel like I should learn how to just be okay with this. I also see the real affect it is having on our department. There is also the point that they are spending more and more time at work not working (and they have very important jobs). I can’t tell if I am being petty for wanting them to stop talking in Japanese as much, or if I am in the right to think that they need to work harder to try to communicate in English more often. I also can’t tell if I am just being spiteful because of the increased workload for me from doing their stuff for them. Can anyone offer any advice for this situation?",

    "text": "From The Archives (2003) - \"The Greater Outrage for Female Victims of Governments' Brutality Perpetuates Risk to Both Sexes\" **The Greater Outrage for Female Victims of Governments' Brutality Perpetuates Risk to Both Sexes**\n\n©2003 Jerry A. Boggs\n\nNothing, it seems, provokes the international community’s outrage more than the atrocities and lesser abuses that governments direct at women and girls.\n\nAmnesty International sounds [this alarm](https://web.archive.org/web/20061112150604/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGACT770021996?open&of=ENG-373): “...[G]overnments have continued to inflict sexual, physical, and other psychological violence against women with impunity ... In recent years, the horrific stories of rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the mass rape by the military and the militia in Rwanda have shown how particularly vulnerable women are in conflicts – how they are often singled out for human rights violations which are not inflicted on men and how assault on a woman’s body is used as a weapon of war.”\n\nIn a speech to the First Ladies' Conference on Domestic Violence in San Salvador in 1998, feminist politician [Hillary Clinton said](https://web.archive.org/web/20061028234519/http://clinton3.nara.gov:80/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1998/19981117.html), “Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children.”\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, at the March 1999 Inter-Agency Videoconference for a World Free of Violence against Women, [lamented](https://web.archive.org/web/20080325035702/http://www.scienceblog.com:80/community/older/archives/L/1999/A/un990269.html), “Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And, it is perhaps the most pervasive.\"\n\nAnd so it goes, up and down the international community, from human rights groups and heads of state, to organized feminists and the mainstream media – all regularly and rightly deploring governments’ savaging of females.\n\nYet when it comes to the inhumane treatment of noncombatant men and boys, nearly everyone seems to have incurred a severe case of laryngitis. By expressing little or no outrage for male victims of government barbarity — or altogether denying there are male victims, as Amnesty often seems to do — the international community does worse than merely expose an antimale bias that gainsays its own long-running plea for equal treatment of the sexes. It also helps perpetuate state-directed brutality against both men and women.\n\nPerhaps before one can even be willing to hear how a greater outrage over anti-female violence could possibly perpetuate this violence, one must be disaffected of the feminist-and-media-driven notion that females are overwhelmingly the marks for governments’ enormities. One must be convinced that men, including non-combatant men, are marked at least as much and that an equal outrage for male victims is therefore justified.\n\nEnter Adam Jones. He is executive director of the Canadian-based human rights group, [Gendercide Watch](http://www.gendercide.org/), and professor of international studies at the Center for Research and Training in Economics in Mexico City. Defining “gendercide” as gender-selective mass killings, Jones has amassed considerable documentation and published scholarly works showing that non-combatant males are subjected to atrocities and mistreatments comparable to, and in many cases worse than, those dealt females.\n\nNon-combatant men, says Jones, “have been and continue to be the most frequent targets of mass killing and genocidal slaughter, as well as a host of lesser atrocities and abuses. The mass killing of males, particularly of ‘battle-age’ men, has roots deep in the history of conflict between human communities. Despite this prevalence of gendercide against males...the subject has received almost no attention across a wide range of policy areas, humanitarian initiatives, and academic disciplines. We at Gendercide Watch feel it is one of the great taboos of the contemporary age, and must be ignored no longer.”\n\n(Jones puts “battle-age” in quotation marks “to problematize a term that rolls off the tongue too easily. The ‘battle-age’ construction implicitly assumes that if a male is of an age that renders him liable to military conscription and combat, his entire identity should be so defined. This renders the analyst complicit with those who would subordinate the destiny of ‘battle age’ males to this outside demand – akin to defining women by their capacity to be raped, and suggesting as well that ‘battle-age’ men are ‘asking for it.’ With this equation of males and combatants completed, the analyst or policymaker can move to the final stage of effacing all non-combatant males from the policy and analytical equation, a phenomenon that is also commonplace.”)\n\nJones’ Gendercide.org is rich in examples of widely ignored gendercides against males. Some from the 20th century are:\n\n* Kosovo, 1999: “Although the Milosevic regime's genocidal assault on Kosovar society swept up all other sectors of the population, killing many and expelling hundreds of thousands, the most systematic and severe atrocities were inflicted disproportionately upon non-combatant men.”\n\n* Srebrenica (Bosnia), 1995: “The long-term success of ethnic cleansing depended on killing off the Muslim men, without whom the population's women and children would have no means of returning.”\n\n* Rwanda, 1994: “[After the massacre] Rwanda became a country of women. It is currently estimated that 70 per cent of the population is female and that 50 per cent of all households are headed by women.” \n\n* Iraq, 1988, 1990-91: During the 1990-91 Gulf War, though officials and the media decried Iraqi troops’ abuse of Kuwaiti and foreign women, little was said of the broader Iraqi system of detention, torture, and execution of tens of thousands of Kuwaitis who were nearly all male. The Iraqi regime’s postwar attack on the Shia “marsh Arabs” in southern Iraq appears to have been highly gender-specific. A Middle East Watch researcher explained, “The troops are arresting all males over 15 and taking them to Radwaniyeh [prison camp]. They’re never seen again.” Thousands are estimated to have died, often after horrific torture. In 1988, during the suppression of rebellious Iraqi Kurds, Middle East Watch reported instances in which men and boys among the captured villagers were executed on the spot. Many tens of thousands of Kurdish males disappeared. The organization suspects that most of them, if not all, were murdered by Iraqi security forces.\n\n* Delhi, 1984: In “Delhi: Gangster Rule,” Madhu Kishwar reports on the 1984 anti-Sikh rioting in New Delhi following the assassination of Indira Gandhi: “The nature of the attacks confirm [sic] that there was a deliberate plan to kill as many Sikh men as possible, hence nothing was left to chance. That also explains why in almost all cases, after hitting or stabbing, the victims were doused with kerosene or petrol and burnt, so as to leave no possibility of their surviving. Between October 31 and November 4, more than 2,500 men were murdered in different parts of Delhi, according to several careful unofficial estimates. There have been very few cases of women being killed except when they got trapped in houses which were set on fire. Almost all the women interviewed described how men and young boys were special targets. When women tried to protect the men of their families, they were given a few blows and were forcibly separated from the men. Even when they clung to the men, trying to save them, they were hardly ever attacked the way men were. I have not yet heard of a case of a woman being assaulted and then burnt to death by the mob.”\n\n* Bangladesh, 1971 (then East Pakistan): In February of that year, the generals of West Pakistan decided to crush the Awami League, which had demanded regional autonomy for East Pakistan and an end to military rule. “Kill three million of them,” said President Yahya Khan at the February conference, “and the rest will eat out of our hands.” At the end of this brutal campaign, 80 percent of the estimated 3 million lives taken in the systematic mass killings were males, many of them adolescent boys.\n\n* World War II, 1941-42: During Operation Barbarossa in just eight months of 1941-42. Invading German armies killed approximately 2.8 million Soviet PoWs through starvation, exposure, and summary execution. “This little-known gendercide,” says Adam Jones, “vies with the genocide in Rwanda as the most concentrated mass killing in human history.” Adam Jones classifies this as a gendercide because “PoW did not just mean men who had seen military service. Nazi policy was explicitly that all men between 15 and 65 were to be taken to PoW camps.”\n\n* Armenia, 1915: According to Jones as interviewed in March 2000 by the Ottawa Citizen’s Christina Spencer, “The first step of that brutal terror was the disarming of conscript Armenian soldiers in the Turkish army. They were turned into pack animals, ‘driven by the whips and bayonets of the Turks into the mountains.’ The weak were left to die or were shot. Next, civilian males were taken from their towns and slaughtered. At this point, the rest of the population -- women, children, the elderly -- were deported.”\n\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Forty million Soviet men were killed between 1914 and 1945. Some families lost every man in the family: dad, son, brother, uncle. Yet a headline in Parade, the largest-selling weekly magazine in the world, reads “Short End of the Stick” with the article explaining Soviet women are getting the short end of the stick because they are stuck with factory and street-cleaner positions. In Bosnia, the civil war has wiped out men so disproportionately that only 30% of the Bosnian population are men. Do headlines tell us, “War leaves Bosnia with 30% Men”? No. Parade’s headline reads, “Women Look to Gain Power in Bosnia.” The focus on the sacrifice made by men as a gender was not only ignored, but Bosnia has specifically been used as an example of the type of war in which both sexes are killed equally. When there’s a story about a man being killed, the focus is not on the sacrifice of men, but of their role. We discover the sacrifice of men as a gender only when it is needed to help us understand the new burdens on women. — ***The Myth of Male Power***, by [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20071107132658/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_5.htm)|\n\n**Adam Jones** also tackles military conscription as a gender-selective abuse. Though sexual slavery of females is easily seen as such an abuse, conscription is not. But Jones says it is “a variant, perhaps the most destructive one, of forced labour, an institution that has led to millions of overwhelmingly male deaths throughout history.” More than 36 million military men died in the last century’s top 20 wars alone. Even today the Russian Army, according to Gendercide Watch, “remains a death-trap for conscripted men – though not at the hands of a foreign invader. As many as 10,000 soldiers die each year from hazing, assaults, murder, and suicide.” In Afghanistan in 2001, because the media blitzed us with reports – justifiably so – on how the Taliban oppressed Afghan women, hardly anyone learned how life was for Afghan soldiers. In pre-Taliban times, when Afghan women enjoyed many rights, war still took a heavy toll on the men. Of Afghanistan’s conflict with the Soviets that began in 1979, Tamim Ansary, a writer in San Francisco, said in a Salon article: “The refugees in Pakistan, those millions who lived in the squalid camps that spawned the Taliban, were mostly the women and children of the men who stayed in the country to fight the Soviets and die like ants.” Ansary omitted the fact that the vast majority of these males, many in their teens, fought because they were forced to do so, and that the requirement to risk dying “like ants” was not thrust upon females. The later advent of the Taliban and its oppression of Afghan women did not mean that males no longer had to worry about war, about being killed or horribly maimed in battle. For some Afghan men, their fate came earlier than expected from their own government, as when Taliban forces, preparing for their war with America, began conducting house-to-house searches for recruits. “Some recruits who refused to join up,” said the Washington Post citing a defector, “were shot....”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|\"...[I]f they [warring tribes] couldn't recruit able-bodied young boys, they simply kidnapped them. Most of the recruits were 12, 13, 14 years old, but some were young as 6.\" —*Wray Herbert, U.S. News & World Report, December 29, 2004*|\n\nTo better appreciate the gender dimension in military conscription, consider that some countries engaging in guerrilla warfare conscript boys young as six! In Sierra Leone in 1999, says Carol Bellamy, executive director of the UN Children’s Fund, seven-year-olds were among the 2,000 child soldiers who were under arms. Boys are often abducted from their homes, beaten, and told, “You either fight or we will kill you.” The humanitarian group Save The Children estimates that more than 1.5 million child soldiers – virtually all boys, by my estimate – have been killed in conflicts from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir from 1985 to 1995. Consider next that although often desperate for soldiers, the countries that recruit young boys rarely recruit, say, 15-to-17-year-old girls, who are much bigger and stronger than 7-year-old boys, emotionally as well as physically, and hence more combat-capable and militarily useful. ([The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061103001657/http://www.child-soldiers.org:80/) says, “In many countries, girls too are used as soldiers, though generally in much smaller numbers than boys.”) The reasons for the conscription of boys undoubtedly include chivalry and the convenience of same-sex armies. But perhaps above all, the nations using boy soldiers may suspect that if in the name of gender equality they equally conscripted girls, the number of people around the world decrying the use of child soldiers — and the efforts to rescue the children — would surge a hundred fold and possibly deprive them of a valuable resource.\n\nStill another broadly ignored government brutality that targets males, as Jones indicates, is the forced labor of civilians. “Throughout history and continuing in modern times,” he wrote in an April 2001 letter to the International Labour Organization (ILO), “the practice of forced labour has overwhelmingly targeted adult able-bodied men, leading to millions if not tens of millions of deaths. Despite this grim record, the ILO’s Forced Labour Convention designates one group and one group only as legitimate targets for forced labour [stress added]: these same adult able-bodied men. Article 11 of the Convention states that ‘Only adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years may be called upon for forced or compulsory labour,’ so long as ‘ they are physically fit for the work required and the conditions under which it is to be carried out’ and ‘the number of adult able-bodied men indispensable for family and social life’ is allowed to remain in communities targeted for forced labour. In addition, the ILO states that both the forced labour involved in military conscription and the use of prison labour are acceptable under the terms of the Convention. Both of these institutions, of course, target males close to 100 percent of the time.” As just one example of forced male labor, the International Committee of the Red Cross charged that during the Bosnian war, hundreds of people in Serb-held areas were “being forced into what amounts to slave labor in dozens of towns and villages....” The forced laborers were, “for the most part, Croatian and Muslim civilian men.”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Imagine the international community’s outrage if the ILO Forced Labour Convention designated only able-bodied females as legitimate targets for forced labor.|\n\nOn rare occasion forced laborers are women. Even then they are luckier than the men. Addressing the enslaving of black Christians in Sudan by Arab militias, newspaper columnist Walter Williams wrote, “They shoot the men and enslave the women and children.” His topic, like that of many who opine on Sudan’s troubles, was slavery. It was not the greater atrocity of men being killed. This atrocity he brought up only once, in passing. He then quickly returned our attention to the women and children. It isn’t difficult to guess what would have been his topic — or how much more vociferous would be the media and feminists — were the Arab militias enslaving the men and children and shooting the women.\n\nAn anti-female atrocity, one that is widely deplored by the media and thus made well known to the world, is “honor” killings or disfigurings of women who disgrace their families. This violence, while not state-directed, is still ignored by police often enough to be deemed virtually government-sanctioned. Covering the topic for ABC television’s “20/20” in January 1999, correspondent Diane Sawyer intoned somberly, “In Jordan alone, a quarter of all the homicides are honor killings, an average of 25 women at least every year.”\n\nThe male counterpart to honor killings is the “blood feud.” It is rarely mentioned in the media and is therefore almost unheard of. It is even more ignored by governments than honor killings of women.\n\nThe institution of the blood feud, dating to the 15th century and extant in the Balkans, Sicily, and Corsica, was established for the purpose of “cleansing honor.” Offenses to honor include calling a man a liar and insulting a man’s wife. Offenses are paid for, and honor cleansed, says Noel Malcolm, author of Kosovo: A Short History, “by killing any male member of the family of the original offender, and the spilt blood of that victim then cries out to its own family for purification.”\n\nThe blood feud has always exempted females, since killing a woman is considered an extreme violation of a man's personal honor. “The strongest taboo of all concerned the murder of women,” says Malcolm, “and any woman could walk through raging gunfire in the knowledge that she would never be shot at.” Conceivably, assuming Malcolm’s definitions of the blood feud and the “strongest taboo” are correct, a woman could kill a man in another family, then, to avenge his death, that family would kill not her but a male in her family! How quickly would the international community stop ignoring blood feuds if they permitted a man to kill a woman in another family, then, to avenge her death, permitted that family to kill not him but a woman in his family?\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Empire, blood feuds have returned full-throttle in Albania, where reconciliation attempts have seen limited success. “Every year,” says Adam Jones, “at least a thousand men and boys die in blood-feud killings in Albania alone; the lives of tens of thousands more are spent in isolation and perpetual fear.” Yet, in covering honor killings, ABC’s “20/20” kept its millions of viewers in the dark about blood feuds and about the vastly larger number of murdered males. It left them to feel outraged only at the “average of at least 25 honor killings of women each year in Jordan alone.” Apparently to “20/20's” staff, the murder of 25 women is more outrageous – and more news-worthy – than a thousand murdered men and boys.\n\nFurther exemplifying their greater mistreatment of males, governments often punish males more severely than females for the same violations of law. This was true of Afghanistan’s Taliban government, though the mainstream media painted the opposite picture with their exclusive focus on that government’s oppression of women. The Taliban’s penal code required that males be punished for violations by females. In December 2001, a Detroit-area television station ran a story about an Afghan woman who defied the Taliban by operating a school. When Taliban troops discovered her, they beat her father.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|When an Afghan man or any other man must endure brutality as well as shame for the religiously “inappropriate” or “illegal” behavior of his family members, we can better understand why he so strongly “wants to control\" his children and his wife: from his view, it makes more sense for them to be oppressed than for him to be both oppressed and brutalized, especially if for a while after being beaten he is unable to work and support them.|\n\nThe Taliban’s penal code also mandated that males be arrested for many other “violations.” “While a woman can be beaten if her face accidentally shows from under her head-to-toe covering,” writes gender expert Cathy Young, author of Ceasefire! Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality, “a man can be beaten if his beard isn't long enough. While a woman who commits adultery faces execution, the same fate awaits her male lover.” Men were punished even if they didn’t break a certain “rule.” Taliban forces systematically detained and executed male civilians in north-central Afghanistan to deter communities from cooperating with opposition forces. According to one report, Taliban troops were repeatedly described as rounding up unarmed men and boys from their homes and work sites and shooting them in the head. There were no reports of females being shot in the head to deter communities from violating the “Don’t cooperate” rule. Such punishments of Afghan males, unlike those of Afghan females, somehow failed to get a lot of coverage in the mainstream media, especially national television, the sole source of news for a huge number of Americans.\n\nSocial researcher Warren Farrell, author of the riveting [Father and Child Reunion](https://www.amazon.com/Father-Child-Reunion-Bring-Children/dp/0615223931), tells of the 1990 Associated Press story about Bobby Sherrill, who worked in Kuwait. When Sherrill returned to the United States, he was arrested, handcuffed, and taken before a magistrate. He had failed to pay full child support for ninety days. The reason? While he was in Kuwait, Iraq invaded the country and he was kidnapped and taken hostage for three months, during which his father paid some but not all of the support. This explanation failed to impress the magistrate, and he demanded an immediate cash payment. Because Sherrill did not have it on him at the time, he was jailed. (There must be an unwritten law somewhere that requires non-custodial fathers to always carry with them a large sum of cash.)\n\nWhat if Sherrill had been a woman? It is extremely difficult for me to believe she would have been treated so unmercifully for being unable to pay child support as a result of her being kidnapped, being held hostage for three months, and having no cash on her when arrested. Few magistrates would have had the will to jail her under such circumstances and risk incurring the public’s wrath, especially feminists’ wrath. Cathy Young would appear to agree. In Ceasefire! she writes: “There is a deeply entrenched habit in our legal system and our culture of treating female offenders more leniently....” If it were male offenders who were treated more leniently, no doubt many in the media and feminist circles would describe the situation for female offenders as an atrocity. Yet because it is men who are treated less leniently, little is said of it and few people realize that even in the United States, which is often called the world’s most civilized nation, mostly men are denied the civilized part by their government.\n\nCathy Young serves up another example of more severe male punishment: “When American teenager Michael Fay was sentenced [in 1994] to be caned for spray-painting cars in Singapore, the public debate centered on whether harsh penalties were too high a price to pay for public order. The fact that caning is imposed only on men was barely noticed. What if a teenage girl were to be whipped for a petty offense in a country where this penalty was reserved for females? Wouldn’t women’s groups, politicians, and the media have treated this as an outrage against women?” Young apparently thinks yes, for she wrote earlier in a Detroit News column, “...[I]t’s a fact that violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men.”\n\nAnd it is this fact — which is the worst sexism — along with stepped-up feminist pressure to end violence against women worldwide, that has influenced the international community to protest anti-female atrocities and abuses to the point that, as Adam Jones says of Canada’s female-focused mobilizing efforts around ex-Yugoslavia, “one could forget any other category of victim exists.”\n\n**While** the international community’s outrage mostly for female victims intends well, it helps perpetuate governments’ brutality against both males and females for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, there is little evidence to support feminists’ claim in recent years that the greater outcry for female victims has resulted in rape and sexual slavery being taken seriously as war crimes. Cathy Young wrote in September 1996: “‘It's about women and children being tortured and murdered,’ said a Court TV ad for the war crimes trial dealing with the horrors in the former Yugoslavia. Earlier this month, women's rights activists at the 7th International Forum of the Association for Women in Development in Washington, D.C., said the atrocities against women in the Balkans might not have happened if rape and sexual slavery had been taken seriously as war crimes after World War II. Let's look at what has happened to Bosnian men. Time after time, Serb troops would separate the adult men from the women and children, load them onto buses and take them to concentration camps. Many men were subjected to horrible tortures, even forced to sexually mutilate each other. Thousands were massacred. That such crimes were taken seriously after World War II apparently did little to deter the perpetrators.”\n\nAs long as the international community’s outrage is mostly for female victims, some warring groups may think eradicating males will more or less be tolerated if care is taken to safeguard females. But in reality, waging war on males while trying not to harm females is somewhat akin to dynamiting a garden in a vain attempt to kill the weeds but not the vegetables. As stated, women are often beaten or killed for trying to impede warriors’ all-important objective of slaughtering men and boys. Sometimes women simply have the misfortune of being in the path of marauding troops whose respect for life has been traumatized out of them because they have been, Jones says, “brutalized and indoctrinated into committing atrocious and genocidal acts against civilian populations or disarmed enemy forces.” They are not unlike the U.S. troops who in the Vietnam War massacred 300 My Lai villagers, including infants. Such hardened soldiers, realizing they have already committed war crimes against non-combatant males and that their own lives can be violently concluded at any moment, may only sneer at threats of prosecution for committing war crimes against females. Some of them, perhaps having learned of the international community’s demand for treating the sexes equally, may also have learned of the international community’s unequal concern for male victims of governments’ barbarity. Perhaps they are inwardly offended and angered by the hypocrisy and sexism – as a lot of female soldiers surely would be if the concern were mostly for males. “Why should I care for others,” they may think, “when no one cares for me?” Horrible as it is to contemplate, some soldiers may be embittered enough to react to warnings to tread carefully around females in the same defiant manner in which recalcitrants react to “Keep off the grass” signs.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|“In large part, the atrocities of war are committed as a response to the fear men feel. Terror and humiliation are the combustible fuels of rage.” — Patricia Pearson, *When She Was Bad*, p. 53 hardcover|\n\nHistorically, warring nations and tribes have attacked the enemy’s civilian population as a strategy to terrorize and demoralize. The idea is that if an attack on civilians is massive and shocking enough, an enemy nation might lose its will to fight and surrender, either on its own or under pressure from its citizens. One such attack is the mass sexual assault of women. It often succeeds in terrorizing and demoralizing because, to repeat Cathy Young, violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men. Thus, the more we protest only atrocities against women, suggesting that this violence is more psychologically damaging to a nation, the more we signal that, as Amnesty International puts it, “assault on a woman’s body [can be] used as a weapon of war.” It is true that were the outrage for male victims and female victims equalized tomorrow, the strategic value of assaulting women might not change for some time; the media- and feminist-fueled construct of women as helpless, vulnerable, and deserving special protection — like children — is simply too ingrained in everyone’s psyche. But the international community’s current trend of denouncing only or mostly the atrocities against females can, in the eyes of some warring nations, only help sustain the value of those atrocities.\n\nThe lesser outrage for male victims (it’s lesser largely because for many people “man as victim,” like “woman as victimizer,” is repellent) tends to reinforce – and may in part stem from – the view of males as disposable. Many of us see males this way, explains Warren Farrell, “because we have learned that the more effectively we prepare men to sacrifice themselves, the more we feel protected.” This need for protection, along with the need of a nation to show its will to fight and defend itself from aggressors, may cause many people to think men should be considered disposable. But this view of males carries a significant downside that seems to be rarely thought out. For every aggressive nation or group that “men are disposable” unnerves, it may prompt one or two others to prematurely reject non-violent methods of resolving conflict, and to choose war, setting in motion the atrocities that claim many lives of both males and females.\n\n||\n|:------|\n| [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622214727/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_1.htm): There is something about women’s role that is also never mentioned. Can you figure it out? Women not sacrificing their lives in war is never discussed as female privilege, as matriarchy.|\n||\n|We saw in the Canadian study of newspapers discussed above how violence against women was portrayed disproportionately to men’s, and was personalized even as men’s was at best a cold statistic.|\n||\n|Here’s why this bias hurts women....|\n||\n|When only women’s suffering is personalized, it motivates us to rescue the woman and assume the cause must be the man. So in problems like domestic violence we blame the man and ignore the male-female dance that leads to both sexes battering each other equally.|\n||\n|This hurts women because, when the man feels he is the assumed cause, he becomes resistant to counseling. He experiences the counseling as identical to his wife – unable to hear him. To him, the counseling is now part of the problem. No, it’s worse than that. Hope disappears, and cynicism appears. And it doesn’t stop there.... He feels both his wife and the system are ganging up against him. Now it’s him against the world, and that’s the set up for mass killings followed by a suicide, which is, and will remain, the male style until men become no more or less worthy as victims than women.|\n\n**Human** rights groups, feminists, the mainstream media, and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan must cease, as Prof. Adam Jones puts it, “hierarchizing human suffering” to the extent that, for example, “the mass rape of women is privileged over the mass slaughter of (non-combatant) men.” Politicians such as Sen. Hillary Clinton must understand that women do not become war's primary victims by surviving genocides and being driven away from their homes to squalid camps where they have the hope, however dim, of rescue and restoration. War's primary victims are, and have always been, the men who are killed — the husbands, fathers, and sons of the women whose lives generally are spared.\n\nThe international community must express an equal outrage for male victims of atrocities and other abuses. It is a matter not only of honoring true gender equality, but of curbing governments’ brutality against both sexes. As the nuclear age advances, it may also be a matter of preserving our very existence.\n\n***[posted Wednesday, 17 December 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029083745/http://battlinbog.blog-city.com/governments_violence_against_the_sexes.htm)***",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "Why I Teach History (7th grade) I’m pretty routinely asked why I bother teaching.  Specifically, people almost always ask why I chose to teach Middle School History.  After all, it is in the past and the kids don’t really care any way.  To try and get to the bottom of that question, I gave an alternative prompt on our most recent large test.  It was inspired but stories from a long-time family friend’s favorite teacher.  The kids, if they wanted to, could write about “What they learned in 7th Grade World History.”  This isn’t supposed to be a humblebrag or back-patting session.  I was just so amazed by what some of my students wrote that I want to share it with all of you.  This is why teachers teach.\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who has been quiet all year.**\n\n\n   I learned a lot more in 7th grade history than just numbers and dates.  I learned how to think deeper about things, I learned more about why you shouldn’t judge someone by their race, and I learned that history happens all the time.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I learned to think deeper.  In the past, I never really thought about the meaning of some of the holidays or why history matters, but now I know that they actually have an important meaning.  I’ve also been way more interested in history.  I want to know about everything, especially when my parents are talking about stuff.\n\n\n   I learned a lot more about why people shouldn’t judge others by the color of their skin.  I learned that it is about more than because its racist and wrong, its also because were all equal.  No one is superior.  Some may think the Europeans are better and smarter than the Meso-Americans but that’s not true because the Meso-Americans also have amazing buildings and creations, such as temples and floating gardens.\n\n\n   History happens all the time.  I used to think that history was just people that changed the world but history also happens in my own life. History is being made everyday, even when we don’t know that it is.  There are also different types of history, such as personal history, world history, and even Internet history.  We probably see a piece of history everyday and we don’t even know it.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I’ve learned that you should think deeper, don’t judge people by their looks, and history is being made everyday.  History is importance because it teaches us what to do and what not do do.  It shows up past mistakes so we know to not repeat them.  Therefore, I have a lot more in 7th grade history than just dates\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who now comes during break to talk about history.**\n\n7th grade World History was one of the most importance experiences of my life.  This class taught me many things that I will remember forever.  It taught me how working hard has it’s benefits, how you should always think about things more carefully, and most importantly, it taught me one of the most important concepts that everyone should learn.\n\nIn this class, the teacher would always push us to do better and always made sure we were doing our best work.  At the beginning of the school year, I found this annoying because I didn’t think I would benefit from it.  I just thought the teacher was too strict about the quality of work.  Now I realize the benefits of this.  It will help me throughout the rest of my life because most things in life, especially when you get a job, need you to do your best and work your hardest to be successful.\n\nThe teacher also taught me the importance of thinking carefully about things.  He taught me this by tricking our classes to see if we would notice he was lying.  Almost every time I fell for his tricks and this taught me to think more closely about things.  Thinking more closely about things will help my everyday life just like always working my hardest will.\n\nLastly, this class taught me about why we care about African civilizations.  This was an important lesson because it showed me how biased our opinions of West African cultures are because they are influenced by European ideas.  This concept will help me educate others on this topic because many do not realize this.  It is the most important thing that I have learned so far in my school career.  Many others need to learn this too.\n\nThis year in 7th grade was very important to me.  It taught me so many important lessons that I will remember forever.  It taught me the importance of thinking closely and working my hardest.  It also taught me about why our opinions on the African cultures are biased and the importance of learning and teaching their true story.  This class will help me in so many ways for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – An Anonymous student that sent 10-20 emails to me over the last two quarters, trying to solve the question of “Why we care?” with no points involved.**\n\n\n\nLearning of the Meso-American and African societies is part of the seventh grade standards, but it is often not told the way it really happened.  The takeover and destruction of these civilizations probes the importance of history and the complexity of people and their actions in history.  The reasons the horrendous actions of the Europeans are still accepted are guilt and faulty reasoning, the lack of purely good and bad people, and bias/lack of enthusiasm in history today.  The repetition of these issues in other situations, even slightly, happens over and over in history and the modern day.\n\n\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived and encountered Meso American or African civilizations, they were quick to declare superiority.  Their first reaction to the confusion of the other people was to assume that they were stupid and had no culture.  When it became apparent that they could use these people to their own advantage, they decided that the best way to relieve the guilt was to make the non-Europeans inhuman.  This creates the illusion that killing and enslaving people was much less cruel than it should be, as they were not people at all.  This idea is used over and over again by thousands of people.  Essentially making the victims of evil actions into people who shouldn’t be seen as victims, thus the actions are no longer evil.  It is seen in history and it is seen now, and being aware of it gives one the ability to properly understand the actions of others.\n\n\n\nThat being said, most who cover up what they are doing do not think they need to cover it up.  Most people legitimately believe that what they are doing is for the greater good, including the Europeans when doing their pillaging.  King Leopold infamously believed that what he was doing benefited the Africans.  It goes to show that humans are never purposely trying to be bad.  Even if they are aware of their cruel actions, they believe that their reasons are good and that what they are doing is just.  There is no such thing as a purely good or purely evil person.\n\n\n\nThe true story of the enslavement and slaughter of the Meso-Americans and the West Africans is often quieted or ignored for the same reasons as displayed above: guilt, excuses, and the honest belief that what the Europeans did was okay.  Without seeing every side of this incredibly complex story, one would be just as ignorant as the Europeans.  It is important to try as hard as possible to become unbiased and open-minded.  This sentiment applies to everything in life.  Surrounding oneself with diverse opinions and views of the world is the fastest way to eliminate ignorance.  One can’t just listen to whoever’s voice is the loudest.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we care about the Meso-American and African civilizations is complex on its own, but it connects to outside issues and the entirety of human nature.  It teaches one how to be an intelligent, less biased member of our society and most significantly, how important history is to achieve this.",

    "text": "Judge: Suspensions OK For Albany High Students Who ‘Liked’ Racist Posts https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/judge-suspensions-ok-albany-high-students-racist-posts/\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An East Bay school district acted properly when it suspended five students who “liked” or commented on racist images on another student’s Instagram account that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach and comparisons of African-American women and students to gorillas, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe case raised thorny questions about how strictly schools can regulate student speech and whether “likes” on social media should be treated similarly to the original posts.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato said in his decision late Wednesday the five students contributed to disruption at Albany High School in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe judge rejected arguments that the Albany Unified School District violated the students’ free speech rights because the offensive posts were on a private account and made off campus.\n\nDonato said the accounts’ followers were mainly Albany High School students. The posts pictured students and school employees and created a risk of substantial disruption at the school, the judge said.\n\n“These cases establish that students have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence,” he said. “They have an equivalent right to enjoy an education in a civil, secure, and safe school environment.”\n\nAn attorney for three of the students had no immediate comment. An attorney for the other two, Darryl Yorkey, said “liking” images does not necessarily express approval.\n\n“I think the judge took an opinion that many of us do in the older generations in assuming that a ‘like’ on its face is just that, ‘I like it, I approve of it,'” he said.\n\nHe said many of the students who were suspended over the images were Asian and were just trying to shock each other.\n\n“Taken out of that context, it definitely looks really bad,” he said. He did not immediately know whether his clients would appeal Donato’s ruling.\n\nA phone message left with the school district seeking comment on the ruling was not immediately returned.\n\nA male student identified in court documents only as “C.E.” created the account in November 2016 and posted on it over the next several months.\n\nOne post showed a screenshot of a female African American student that she had captioned, “I wanna go back to the old way.”\n\nC.E. juxtaposed an image on the student’s post of a white man beating a black slave hung by his hands, according to Donato’s ruling.\n\nSchool officials learned about the account in March. They called in mental health counselors to help calm students and contacted police over concerns references to lynching, nooses and the Ku Klux Klan in the posts could constitute threats of violence, Donato said.\n\nC.E. was suspended and later expelled. Donato upheld his discipline as well on Wednesday.\n\nBut the judge said the district went too far when it disciplined two other students. One followed the account but appeared to have done nothing else and the other commented that the account was “racism solely directed at black people” with an emoji of a laughing face, the judge said.\n\nThe judge overturned their suspensions.",

    "text": "How do I know if I should quit my job as a junior developer? I'm a junior dev at a startup in New York. When I joined the company I didn't have any experience or a degree but even with that in mind, I'd still say my knowledge of Ruby/RoR at least was *approaching* that of a mid-level developer. The only company that would give me a job at the time primarily use Golang, which I sorta knew but not really. I told them this and they said it'd be cool and that I could work on one or two minor Ruby projects and do some customer support (everyone at the company was expected to do this back then) before eventually progressing to a mid-level role and working on Go code.\n\nSo it's been six months now and I feel that while my understanding of Go and the technologies my company specializes in have improved, they haven't improved anywhere near fast enough. There wasn't really much of a dev team when I joined (it was just me, another junior developer, a contractor and our CEO alongside less technical members of senior management). The CEO left the country a few months ago and now works from home but even when he was around, he was often pretty much doing his own thing and we were left to our own devices much of the time. Even now that they've hired more experienced staff, I still feel like I'm not getting the level of support I need. I don't expect anyone to teach me Go and I try not ask questions about it unless it becomes a blocker. But often when I raise a question about the way in which our core product functions in the company's Slack channel, I'm either ignored, forced to make do with the fact that nobody in my time zone understands the code well enough to know the answer, given answers that confuse more than help or, on rare occasions, belittled for not knowing the answer already even though everyone knows how much the existing documentation sucks. As a result, I often feel overwhelmed by the support side of my role and even on days where there are barely any user queries, I'm plagued by issues with the build environment that nobody can ever help me with or assigned confusing tasks that seemingly no one understands. I don't even really get to code all that much and often just feel more like an overpaid application support engineer than a developer.\n\nI don't know if this is all just growing pains and if I should just keep at it or if this really is a bad environment for me. Even though I feel really lonely most of the time (most of the other developers work from home in different states and I actually don't have that much in common with any of them - I'm the only African American and one of only three women in the company, I'm the only developer who doesn't either have a CS degree or 5 years+ of experience, etc.), I do actually really like the people I work with. At the same time, I worry that I might be being taken advantage of, which just tends to happen to me a lot in general. I've considered leaving but I'm also conscious of the fact that almost none of the code I've worked on in the last six months has been made public so, to a potential employer, I'd look as though I were in the same position as I was back when I was looking for a job six months ago.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "text": "There Are Only 23 Black Owned Banks Left in America > Black-Owned Banks Hit Their Peak a Century Ago \n\n> In late 19th and early 20th century, 57 black-owned charter banks entered the system\n\n> Black-owned banks arose and flourished in a period when African-Americans were kept out of other financial institutions, both overtly and through practices that effectively walled off their neighborhoods from other banks.\n\n> The sector hit a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when 57 black-owned banks and credit unions existed. \n\n> Six CEOs of black-owned banks locked themselves in a New Orleans conference room for more than a day in late 2016. Surrounded by papers, drawing boards and PowerPoints, the group strategized ways to reverse a trend 15 years in the making: the decline of their own banking sector.\n\n> The number of black-owned banks operating in the U.S. has been dropping steadily for the past 15 years and fell to 23 this year, the lowest level in recent history, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That has left many African-American communities short of access to capital and traditional financial services, according to some banking experts.\n\n> “We have a crisis among black banks,” said Doyle Mitchell, CEO of Washington-based Industrial Bank. “We met…to save the industry. To save ourselves.”\n\n> The 2008 recession hit the black banking sector especially hard, and if the current rate of closures of about two a year, as well as the industry-wide reluctance or inability to start banks, continues, black-owned banks could disappear entirely within the next eight to 12 years.\n\n> The trend is worrisome to some analysts who argue fewer banks serving low-income, minority groups could expand “financial deserts”—communities with few or no banking institutions—and increase the likelihood that black and Hispanic communities could become susceptible to redlining, a discriminatory practice that excludes poorer minority areas from financial services.\n\n> “These banks are banks that serve relatively poor neighborhoods,” said Russell Kashian, an economics professor who studies black-owned banks. “There are neighborhoods that if…the black-owned bank isn’t there, nobody is there.”\n\n> Most black-owned banks typically have a few branches in one city, although one of the category’s largest players, New Orleans-based Liberty Bank, has a multistate presence. Such banks comprise just a sliver of the overall U.S. financial sector, with collective assets of $5.5 billion, versus $16.3 trillion in the industry overall.\n\n> As a result, some economists question the significance of the sector’s decline. “Size-wise they’ve been small,” said Nicholas Lash, a business professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies minority banking. “So their total impact on black communities can’t be very, very large.”\n\n> Yet those who live in communities that have been served by black-owned banks say the impact there, both practical and psychological, is deeply felt. The most recent example is in Chicago, where Illinois state regulators in January closed Seaway Bank & Trust, determining that its financial health had so deteriorated that pumping in more money couldn’t save it.\n\n> “It was like air coming out of a balloon,” said Bob Fioretti, a former Chicago alderman who was previously involved in raising money to keep Seaway open. “People were deflated. Seaway was a standing icon of the community.”\n\n> Seaway, formerly Chicago’s largest black-owned bank, helped anchor the famed black business community on the city’s South Side.\n\n> Claire Adams, a former board president of a South Side Chicago housing community that was one of the first businesses to use Seaway when it opened in 1965, said she now fears that with fewer small, community banks in her part of the city, payday lenders and check-cashing institutions, which often charge exorbitant rates and fees, would be many African-Americans’ only nearby banking option.\n\n> “The only thing that’s left are these predatory institutions,” Ms. Adams said.\n\n> In some areas of the South Side, Seaway was the first bank some African-Americans had access to, making it a symbol of black enterprise and economic development, patrons say. Many speak of the bank with admiration, often mentioning a program that allowed children to open a bank account with a small amount of money.\n\n> “I [could go to] Chase or something…but I like Seaway,” said Nell Robinson, who has used Seaway for more than two decades. “Seaway was here before Chase. It’s a black bank [and], we have to pull our people up.”\n\n> With such concerns in mind, members of the South Side’s religious community raised more than $100,000 in deposits for Seaway in 2016. But the effort wasn’t enough. Seaway was sold to the State Bank of Texas, then sold again to North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union.\n\n> A prolonged period of low interest rates and intense competition, as bigger banks slowly move into underserved areas, have combined to contribute to the black banking sector’s decline, even after the recession’s end. Now a practical concern in Chicago and elsewhere is that, even if bigger institutions step in, they won’t be as accommodating in lending to black-owned businesses.\n\n> A survey of entrepreneurs by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014 found that 47% of black business owners had gotten the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites.\n\n> That survey also showed fear of rejection was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek needed capital at all.\n\n> “When I have an applicant that comes into my bank and comes into XYZ large bank, and they’re on the edges, there are things that I can understand and appreciate about their situation that XYZ large bank won’t, and that makes the difference,” Mr. Mitchell, of Industrial Bank, said.\n\nI feel like we have to do whatever we can to keep these financial institutions alive man. Some of these banks & credit unions have been serving us and our communities since before integration. No way we should let them down now by continuing to take our business to people who don't care about or respect us. \n\nI have an account w/ Industrial Bank here in DC which is black owned in fact it was my very first bank account ever. My parents are the reason for this, and I'm proud to say I still do business with them to this day.",

    "text": "What can my mom do? Alright Reddit.. I've had several throwaways and small accounts, but I've never actually posted before. I'm really banking on some helpful advice here. \n\nMy mom graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, but she stayed home with my siblings and I while we were really young. When we were kids, she went back to school to obtain a Master's Degree in Science Education, and she started teaching high school Chemistry. She taught at her first school for a few years, but her contract wasn't renewed because she had run afoul of the head principal (not giving school board member's children grades they didn't deserve, not passing star athletes who didn't put in the work, and disciplining a girl for acting belligerent and skipping class, who in turn went to said principal and accused my mother of being racist and only disliking her because she was African American). \n\nShe found a new job for the next school year at a smaller school district teaching Advanced Biology and Environmental Science, and even though it was a smaller school (the previous high school had been a huge intercity school) her salary went up by about 10k per year. She taught there for 1 full year, and is in her second year at this high school. \n\nHowever, yesterday she was told that because the school can't pass a levy (it's a very small blue collar area who doesn't value education too much) her and a few other newer teachers are being let go and absorbed for the following year. She is still getting payed through the summer, and she's going to finish up the year, but she won't have a job after that. \n\nWe're not going to be without an income as my dad is a police officer and I'm moving out of my parents house when college is finished, but my question is what are her options? \n\nShe put so much into teaching and loves making a difference in her kids' lives, and she's a very good teacher. She's just tired of looking for a new job every couple of years, and anyone who is a teacher knows how hard jobs are to come by. She is a very smart woman, but she doesn't know what else she can do besides teaching. \n\nIs there any type of profession that those degrees can matter in besides teaching? I'm not sure what else to ask but if you guys could take a second and give whatever advice you have, no matter how small. I just want my mom to be happy and I feel bad that she keeps getting screwed by the education system. \n\nI appreciate everything you guys have to offer.",

    "text": "CVS Interview, What just happened? About a week ago, my wife got a phone call from a very enthusiastic manager at CVS to interview as a pharmacist. She told her all these great goodies about the job and how she loves to work with new Graduates and her excitement over my wife's experiences. She said she is especially happy wifey has an RN degree too. She stated she is excited to see her and the interview will be more or less to determine if my wife is willing to hit the ground rolling aka (more of a formality).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few days later the district manager calls my wife apologizing about how enthusiastic the manager was stating that she skipped the normal interview process by calling her first, that he has to call and do a pre-interview and then assign her to a manager/region but she jumped the gun; so he has a lengthy interview with her and he is happy to go ahead with the onsite, saying in his career he has had only 10 candidates out of hundreds that had her dual degree. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday she went in for the interview, the manager sees my wife and my wife says her whole body language changed, warmness and excitement went out the window, just cold stoic conversations. The manager said she wanted someone with nursing experience, not someone who just went straight from nursing to college (?), the wife said she has over 4 years of working in various departments (per her resume). \nThe interviewer then said she is looking for specific skills (no elaboration), the wife said she has the basics related to the position from her rotations, and that the interviewer had been previously expressed preference of her being a new grad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe interviewer then went on to give her potential negatives on how involving the position is (things she knows) suggesting it might not be something she might want. The wife replied that she's more than up for it. \n\nThe interview ended with \"we will see if we want you for another onsite interview\". \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat hurt me the most is when my wife called me really depressed and almost in tears asking me if this went sideways because she was black? Her name sounds Japanese (we are African) and most time people are surprised that the name and voice do not match perceived appearance. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI refuse to believe that this is a reason, I just need help wrapping my head around all this. How did things go so sideways? I always tell my wife to add these people on LinkedIn so that there are no surprises. This is just gut wrenching sad. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:** Warm exciting phone interview goes cold on meeting my wife in person.",

    "text": "Any words of wisdom? So I am working at a sporting goods store that has a sandwich shop inside and have been working this job for two years. My supervisor has only been in my department for one year and she has tried to put me down if I don't have enough time to finish stuff and it is left to be finished the next day. She has done some other stuff like going off for 45 minutes to an hour without telling us where she is going and not doing her job 's responsibilities. She has also denied one of my coworkers medical- necessarily breaks that she has a doctor's note for. The thing is that she has done the running off and not doing her job when she was in her previous department. \n\nNow I've notice when my manager does the sechduling, he only schedules me one day a week to work with her, and it has been usually Saturdays, if I work that is. I also work in other departments when they usually need the extra man power.  I have also applied for other positions within the store and one is under the same manager but different department. \n\nNow I have been told that our manager and the store manager is aware of the stuff that she is doing and are planning on having a meeting with her, but I know that she has lied to get herself out of trouble before. And she has also told another coworker that if she is fired she will pull the race card (she's african-american). So what I am asking is that should I report this to my company's hotline  or just wait it out?\n\nEDIT: I have should have added I love my job and the people I work with it is just that I shouldn't have to go in to work worrying that if I slip up just once, I'm going to get reprimanded for a simple mistake, that she has made too.",

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "How do I know if I should quit my job as a junior developer? I'm a junior dev at a startup in New York. When I joined the company I didn't have any experience or a degree but even with that in mind, I'd still say my knowledge of Ruby/RoR at least was *approaching* that of a mid-level developer. The only company that would give me a job at the time primarily use Golang, which I sorta knew but not really. I told them this and they said it'd be cool and that I could work on one or two minor Ruby projects and do some customer support (everyone at the company was expected to do this back then) before eventually progressing to a mid-level role and working on Go code.\n\nSo it's been six months now and I feel that while my understanding of Go and the technologies my company specializes in have improved, they haven't improved anywhere near fast enough. There wasn't really much of a dev team when I joined (it was just me, another junior developer, a contractor and our CEO alongside less technical members of senior management). The CEO left the country a few months ago and now works from home but even when he was around, he was often pretty much doing his own thing and we were left to our own devices much of the time. Even now that they've hired more experienced staff, I still feel like I'm not getting the level of support I need. I don't expect anyone to teach me Go and I try not ask questions about it unless it becomes a blocker. But often when I raise a question about the way in which our core product functions in the company's Slack channel, I'm either ignored, forced to make do with the fact that nobody in my time zone understands the code well enough to know the answer, given answers that confuse more than help or, on rare occasions, belittled for not knowing the answer already even though everyone knows how much the existing documentation sucks. As a result, I often feel overwhelmed by the support side of my role and even on days where there are barely any user queries, I'm plagued by issues with the build environment that nobody can ever help me with or assigned confusing tasks that seemingly no one understands. I don't even really get to code all that much and often just feel more like an overpaid application support engineer than a developer.\n\nI don't know if this is all just growing pains and if I should just keep at it or if this really is a bad environment for me. Even though I feel really lonely most of the time (most of the other developers work from home in different states and I actually don't have that much in common with any of them - I'm the only African American and one of only three women in the company, I'm the only developer who doesn't either have a CS degree or 5 years+ of experience, etc.), I do actually really like the people I work with. At the same time, I worry that I might be being taken advantage of, which just tends to happen to me a lot in general. I've considered leaving but I'm also conscious of the fact that almost none of the code I've worked on in the last six months has been made public so, to a potential employer, I'd look as though I were in the same position as I was back when I was looking for a job six months ago.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "text": "Angry Letter I Wrote 2 Years Ago I can’t help but to think the only real reason I can’t seem to get any type of  production artist/ graphic design/ or screen printing position is because I’m a young black female. I usually hate throwing the race card in but I don’t know where else to turn. Never mind the fact that I have the degree required for these companies in the first place. It’s strange how every time I contact these companies when I see that there is a new space open they’re either “too busy” to take a minute to talk to me or the position has been filled. I polish my resume and cover letter well and because my name isn’t ethnic sounding I usually get asked to come in for an interview (Why is that still a thing in 2015?) Professionally dressed and well spoken. Only to keep getting turned down because I’m not the blonde Brittany stereotype that was assumed on paper.\n \nI can’t even seem to get a position at art retail stores. I don’t seem to fit the mostly white male hipster vibe most of them seem to have. When asked how I could contribute to the sales I explained how I do my own illustration and how I can give others that come into the store my own input on supplies and materials. Even left business cards at the end of the interview but I either get told that I’m too over qualified or too under qualified and don’t get the position. Most of the yelp reviews of one art supply store in particular was saying how most the sales associates don’t even know their products at all. \n\nThe summer between my junior and senior year of college I had applied to an AC Moore where the hiring manger was an alumni of the school I was going to and saw how qualified I was but did I get hired nope! I went back a few weeks later to pick up supplies for a watercolor painting I wanted to do and I happened to pick up a sheet of Arches cold press watercolor paper that didn’t have a code bar. The red haired girl ringing me up got confused and to this day that statement still rings in my head as she asked her co-workers “How much is this poster board?” I was done literally just done right then and there. I didn’t get hired but this girl who does not even know the difference between watercolor paper and poster board got hired probably solely on her looks alone.\n\nSame thing goes for all those companies that turned me down. One screen printing place had a manager that told me that he couldn’t hire me because he couldn’t afford to pay me. (But he sure as hell paid for a damn chiropractor the same day he let me go and spent half the day shooting hoops smh). Not all young black people like myself are the way Fox News likes to portray us; most of us have goals and aspirations outside of twerking or being labeled “thugs”\n\nI’m not “right” for those jobs but I sure as hell was qualified to waste seven months of my life working in a burger joint. Not once I did have the energy to even do my illustration pick up a pencil or paintbrush because of that dead end low paying barely making it job. Didn’t learn any new pen and ink styles I wanted to further develop but I was pretty damn good at salting fries all day. I was tired all the time and at 22 to 23 years old I should have all the energy in the world but I didn’t. In fact when my manger let me go he had just hired his brother as a line cook despite him not shaving his Santa beard and working the grill (nasty) must be nice.\n\nSo now I’m back to square one once more trying to hopefully get employed again soon. But right now my main focus is trying to get new artwork done since I spent the past year just kind of drifting because of financial worries. I have lost sight of this is something that I love and it’s not a job it’s me building a career. I still dream of being a children’s book illustrator and I’m not ready to throw in the towel just yet. In fact I want to strive to be the very first African American woman to win the Caldecott Medal. That the type of quality illustration I want to be making and if I ever get to that level they’ll be the ones sorry for overlooking me.",

    "text": "Why I Teach History (7th grade) I’m pretty routinely asked why I bother teaching.  Specifically, people almost always ask why I chose to teach Middle School History.  After all, it is in the past and the kids don’t really care any way.  To try and get to the bottom of that question, I gave an alternative prompt on our most recent large test.  It was inspired but stories from a long-time family friend’s favorite teacher.  The kids, if they wanted to, could write about “What they learned in 7th Grade World History.”  This isn’t supposed to be a humblebrag or back-patting session.  I was just so amazed by what some of my students wrote that I want to share it with all of you.  This is why teachers teach.\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who has been quiet all year.**\n\n\n   I learned a lot more in 7th grade history than just numbers and dates.  I learned how to think deeper about things, I learned more about why you shouldn’t judge someone by their race, and I learned that history happens all the time.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I learned to think deeper.  In the past, I never really thought about the meaning of some of the holidays or why history matters, but now I know that they actually have an important meaning.  I’ve also been way more interested in history.  I want to know about everything, especially when my parents are talking about stuff.\n\n\n   I learned a lot more about why people shouldn’t judge others by the color of their skin.  I learned that it is about more than because its racist and wrong, its also because were all equal.  No one is superior.  Some may think the Europeans are better and smarter than the Meso-Americans but that’s not true because the Meso-Americans also have amazing buildings and creations, such as temples and floating gardens.\n\n\n   History happens all the time.  I used to think that history was just people that changed the world but history also happens in my own life. History is being made everyday, even when we don’t know that it is.  There are also different types of history, such as personal history, world history, and even Internet history.  We probably see a piece of history everyday and we don’t even know it.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I’ve learned that you should think deeper, don’t judge people by their looks, and history is being made everyday.  History is importance because it teaches us what to do and what not do do.  It shows up past mistakes so we know to not repeat them.  Therefore, I have a lot more in 7th grade history than just dates\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who now comes during break to talk about history.**\n\n7th grade World History was one of the most importance experiences of my life.  This class taught me many things that I will remember forever.  It taught me how working hard has it’s benefits, how you should always think about things more carefully, and most importantly, it taught me one of the most important concepts that everyone should learn.\n\nIn this class, the teacher would always push us to do better and always made sure we were doing our best work.  At the beginning of the school year, I found this annoying because I didn’t think I would benefit from it.  I just thought the teacher was too strict about the quality of work.  Now I realize the benefits of this.  It will help me throughout the rest of my life because most things in life, especially when you get a job, need you to do your best and work your hardest to be successful.\n\nThe teacher also taught me the importance of thinking carefully about things.  He taught me this by tricking our classes to see if we would notice he was lying.  Almost every time I fell for his tricks and this taught me to think more closely about things.  Thinking more closely about things will help my everyday life just like always working my hardest will.\n\nLastly, this class taught me about why we care about African civilizations.  This was an important lesson because it showed me how biased our opinions of West African cultures are because they are influenced by European ideas.  This concept will help me educate others on this topic because many do not realize this.  It is the most important thing that I have learned so far in my school career.  Many others need to learn this too.\n\nThis year in 7th grade was very important to me.  It taught me so many important lessons that I will remember forever.  It taught me the importance of thinking closely and working my hardest.  It also taught me about why our opinions on the African cultures are biased and the importance of learning and teaching their true story.  This class will help me in so many ways for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – An Anonymous student that sent 10-20 emails to me over the last two quarters, trying to solve the question of “Why we care?” with no points involved.**\n\n\n\nLearning of the Meso-American and African societies is part of the seventh grade standards, but it is often not told the way it really happened.  The takeover and destruction of these civilizations probes the importance of history and the complexity of people and their actions in history.  The reasons the horrendous actions of the Europeans are still accepted are guilt and faulty reasoning, the lack of purely good and bad people, and bias/lack of enthusiasm in history today.  The repetition of these issues in other situations, even slightly, happens over and over in history and the modern day.\n\n\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived and encountered Meso American or African civilizations, they were quick to declare superiority.  Their first reaction to the confusion of the other people was to assume that they were stupid and had no culture.  When it became apparent that they could use these people to their own advantage, they decided that the best way to relieve the guilt was to make the non-Europeans inhuman.  This creates the illusion that killing and enslaving people was much less cruel than it should be, as they were not people at all.  This idea is used over and over again by thousands of people.  Essentially making the victims of evil actions into people who shouldn’t be seen as victims, thus the actions are no longer evil.  It is seen in history and it is seen now, and being aware of it gives one the ability to properly understand the actions of others.\n\n\n\nThat being said, most who cover up what they are doing do not think they need to cover it up.  Most people legitimately believe that what they are doing is for the greater good, including the Europeans when doing their pillaging.  King Leopold infamously believed that what he was doing benefited the Africans.  It goes to show that humans are never purposely trying to be bad.  Even if they are aware of their cruel actions, they believe that their reasons are good and that what they are doing is just.  There is no such thing as a purely good or purely evil person.\n\n\n\nThe true story of the enslavement and slaughter of the Meso-Americans and the West Africans is often quieted or ignored for the same reasons as displayed above: guilt, excuses, and the honest belief that what the Europeans did was okay.  Without seeing every side of this incredibly complex story, one would be just as ignorant as the Europeans.  It is important to try as hard as possible to become unbiased and open-minded.  This sentiment applies to everything in life.  Surrounding oneself with diverse opinions and views of the world is the fastest way to eliminate ignorance.  One can’t just listen to whoever’s voice is the loudest.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we care about the Meso-American and African civilizations is complex on its own, but it connects to outside issues and the entirety of human nature.  It teaches one how to be an intelligent, less biased member of our society and most significantly, how important history is to achieve this.",

    "text": "Ontological Commitments, Sex and Gender, by Mari Mikkola Excerpt from \"Feminist Metaphysics - Explorations in the Ontology of Sex, Gender and the Self\", edited by Charlotte Witt.\n\n***\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis chapter develops an alternative for (what feminists call) “the sex/gender distinction”. I do so in order to avoid certain problematic implications the distinction underpins. First, the sex/gender distinction paradigmatically holds that some social conditions determine one’s gender (whether one is a woman or a man), and that some biological conditions determine one’s sex (whether one is female or male). Further, sex and gender come apart. Taking gender as socially constructed, this implies that women exist mind-dependently, or due to productive human social activities; thus, it should be possible to do away with them just by altering the social conditions on which gender depends. In addition, some feminists take gender to depend on oppressive social conditions. Changing our social environments, then, would not only unwittingly eradicate women; doing away with women should be feminism’s political goal. I argue that both implications are unacceptable. In response, I argue for a view that is more congenial to ordinary thinking and that doesn’t have the goal of eradicating women.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis chapter develops a model, which I will call “the trait/norm covariance model”, as an alternative for understanding the phenomena feminists usually discuss under the rubric of the sex/gender distinction. This well-known distinction gives rise to certain problems that motivate the formulation of my alternative model. Specifically, I have in mind here problems arising from the conventionalist and abolitionist implications that the distinction underpins. First, consider the conventionalist implications: paradigmatically, some social conditions must be met in order for one to count as a woman or a man because gender is (as the slogan goes) socially constructed. One need not satisfy any biological or anatomical conditions; they are relevant only for counting as female or male. On this understanding “woman” and “man” are used as gender terms, “female” and “male” as sex terms.  The implication is that women and men exist mind-dependently or due to productive human social activities: that there are women and men ontologically depends on some social institutions and agents, their beliefs, practices and/or conventions in that women and men could not exist unless the relevant institutions, practices and conventions (with conscious agents upholding them) existed. Women and men are akin to wives, husbands and US senators that also depend on us for their existence.  This being so, it should be possible to do away with women and men while leaving the individuals we call “women” and “men” otherwise intact–we simply alter those social conditions on which gender depends so that individuals no longer count as women and men. Consider a parallel to US senators: their existence depends on certain sociopolitical conventions so that were a political revolution to alter those conventions by abolishing the US Senate, US senators would literally vanish overnight. Those individuals who previously counted as US senators would no longer do so despite being otherwise physically intact (presuming the revolution were a bloodless one). Just as one need not execute US senators in order to eradicate them, the thought is, eradicating women and men does not require physically altering those individuals we think of as women and men. Second, consider the abolitionist implication: in addition to holding a conventionalist view, some feminists take gender to depend ontologically on oppressive social conditions. As a result, changing our social environments would not only unwittingly eradicate women and men: doing away with gender should be feminism’s political goal.  \n\n\nAs I see it, both implications are problematic and ones that many ordinary social agents are unwilling to accept. Ordinarily, women are thought to be human females, men human males. As a result, their existence is not thought to depend on productive human social conventions, practices and institutions so that we could abolish women and men leaving intact females and males simply by altering our social landscapes. Conventionalist implications, then, are unintuitive. Further, ordinary social agents often find the abolitionist implication that “after the revolution” women and men will no longer exist objectionable. Many of my students, along with other feminist philosophers, do not see being a woman or a man as problematic per se. Rather, the problem is how we are viewed and treated as women and men. For ordinary thinking, then, the idea that feminists should aim to do away with women and men harbors undesirable ontological commitments.\n\nThese problems are generated by a clash between the paradigmatic feminist and everyday conceptions of sex and gender. Ordinary thinking does not separate sex and gender in the way many feminists do, thus neither seeing the existence of women and men as mind-dependent nor holding that gender is something to be eradicated. We can avoid this clash in one of two ways: either feminists work hard to modify everyday conceptions of sex and gender so that they are in line with the conventionalist and abolitionist views, or feminists modify their conceptions of sex and gender so that they are closer to everyday thinking. Here I will endorse the latter option and propose a way to conceptualize the phenomena usually discussed under the sex/gender distinction to avoid the unintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments. I will do so by developing what I will call “the trait/norm covariance model” to replace the usual sex/gender distinction. My alternative model will involve redrawing the boundaries of the sets of gender and sex traits and dividing these traits into new sets: descriptive traits (traits of which there is “a fact of the matter”) and evaluative norms (norms that express judgments about descriptive traits). For instance, the paradigmatic gender trait of wearing make-up and the paradigmatic sex trait of having ovaries will both count as descriptive traits (one either has ovaries/regularly wears make-up or not). But, my model also acknowledges the influence of social norms: certain evaluations (like being judged to act, be or appear “feminine”) can be seen to covary with particular descriptive traits, which accounts for why some traits are supposedly appropriate for women and others for men.4\n\n \n\n\n4\nBy way of illustration, I will consider Sally Haslanger’s fascinating and innovative recent account of gender (“Gender and Race”; “Future Genders”; “Social Construction”), which has the conventionalist and abolitionist implications. Next, I will examine what precisely is problematic about these implications in order to motivate my alternative model. I will then outline my trait/norm covariance model, ending with a discussion of how it avoids the problematic ontological commitments considered.\n\n**Haslanger on Gender: An Example**\n\nHaslanger’s account of gender has conventionalist and abolitionist implications: it takes the existence of women and men to be mind-dependent in the sense of depending on human social practices and conventions, and it takes these conventions and practices to be oppressive—for her, since gender is a product of oppressive social forces feminists should aim to eradicate it. These implications are underpinned by a distinction between sex and gender that many feminists have historically endorsed. Paradigmatically: “sex” denotes human females and males depending on some biological features (like chromosomes, sex organs, hormones or other physical features to do with reproduction) whereas “gender” denotes women and men depending on some social factors (like social role, position, behaviour or identity). As is well known, the motivation for drawing the sex/gender distinction was to counter biological determinism that took some (supposedly) biological facts to explain behavioural and psychological differences between women and men. Instead, feminists argued that these differences have social causes. They distinguished biological and social/psychological differences and began using the term “gender” to denote the latter. For instance, Gayle Rubin (who was one of the first feminists to articulate this distinction) used the phrase “sex/gender system” in order to describe “a set of arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (165). For Rubin, although sex differences are fixed, gender differences are the oppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and men should behave: women are oppressed as women and “by having to be women” (204). For her, gender is the social interpretation of sex and an oppressive one at that. However, women’s oppression is mutable by political and social reform that abolishes gender. As Rubin saw it, feminism should aim to create a “genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (204).\n\nFor Haslanger, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining it we must make reference to social factors (“Ontology and Social Construction” 98), and, in particular, we must make reference to unequal social positions (“Gender and Race” 37–43). In so doing, Haslanger aims to debunk the ordinary view that gender classification is a matter of anatomy. Commonly, being female is thought to be sufficient for womanhood; Haslanger, on the other hand, takes the conditions for satisfying “woman” to be social rather than biological. Her project involves showing that although the use of the term “woman” is thought to track a group of “individuals defined by a set of physical ... conditions [it] is better understood as capturing a group that occupies a certain ... social position” (“Social Construction” 318). And the social positions that our gendered classification scheme tracks and that make gender ascriptions apt crucially involve reference to subordination and privilege. For Haslanger, societies in general tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies” (“Gender and Race” 38) so that the social positions they subsequently occupy are better than the social positions of those with female bodies. And this generates sexist injustices. For her:\n\n>S is a woman if [by definition] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n\n>S is a man if [by definition] S is systematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a male’s biological role in reproduction (“Future Genders” 6–7).\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman or a man: what makes calling S a woman apt is not that S is female, but that S is oppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man apt is not that S is male, but that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that debunking projects like hers sometimes require a “radical change in our thinking” (“Social Construction” 319). After all, her proposal is counterintuitive: privileged females like, arguably, the Queen of England would not count as women on this view. But Haslanger’s project does not aim to capture what ordinary language users intuitively have in mind and her aim is not to illuminate our commonsense understandings of gender terms. Haslanger’s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists should be using (“Gender and Race” 33).  That is, endorsing her classification scheme is a pragmatic political choice. And (Haslanger holds) feminists should choose her account of gender since it will be helpful in feminist fights against sexist injustices enabling feminists to identify and explain persistent inequalities between women and men in terms of their social positions. Insofar as Haslanger takes being a woman to be a social matter crucially tied to oppression, she holds that “it is part of the project of feminism to bring about a day when there are no more women (though, of course, we should not aim to do away with females!)” (“Gender and Race” 46). Since what it is to be a woman is by definition tied to sexist oppression, gender justice would eradicate women by abolishing those social structures that are responsible for sex-marked oppression. Women and men could not exist, unless sexist oppression existed; that women and men exist is mind-dependent being the result of oppressive human social activities. And feminism’s goal should be to dismantle those social structures responsible for gender and, by extension, women and men.\n\nProblems with the Conventionalist and Abolitionist Implications\n\nEarlier I claimed that ordinary thinking finds the conventionalist and abolitionist implications of accounts like Haslanger’s problematic. I also claimed that these problems are underpinned by a clash between different conceptions of sex and gender. Let’s examine the worries in more detail.\n\nThe Conventionalist View Is Unintuitive\n\nFor Haslanger (among others) gender depends on something social and not on anything biological. This prima facie makes being a woman ontologically on a par with being a US senator, a wife or a landlord. And, it seems, just as one can cease to be a wife by changing one’s social relations (by getting a divorce), one should be able to cease to be a woman by changing those social relations constitutive of womanhood. But a closer examination suggests that being a woman is not ontologically on a par with (say) being a wife. To tease this out, consider the following claims:\n\n(1)\tFor a week last summer, James was a woman.\n\n(2)\tFor a week last summer, James was a US senator.\n\nThese statements take “woman” and “US senator” as social notions. The first takes womanhood to be about easily perceptible gender markers like clothing and appearance (James lived “as a woman” for a week last summer). The second takes James to have been treated in ways that enabled him to count as a US senator for a week (for instance, James was elected to the US Senate, but due to a political scandal lost his position very quickly). Now, consider:\n\n(3)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a woman.\n\n(4)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a US senator.\n\nThese claims are not about social factors. We can understand claim (3) and it makes sense to us, although we are clearly using “woman” as a biological term. However, when we substitute “woman” for “US senator” in (4), the statement no longer makes sense to us. After all, just by looking at one’s body, it’s not possible to know that one is a US senator. That is, when used as a social term, “woman” is on a par with “US senator”. But we can also use “woman” as a biological term, which makes “woman” and “US senator” come apart. The upshot of this is that “woman” is not a purely social term ; for ordinary thinking, then, being a woman is not on a par ontologically with what it is to be a member of some other social kind. And this suggests that it is not obviously true that women and men’s existence is minddependent in that one can cease to be a woman (or a man) just by altering one’s social environment. Because ordinary thinking does not see being a woman as a purely social matter, conventionalist implications (like the implication that we can eradicate women and men via change in our social environments) are hard to accept. The paradigmatic feminist distinction between sex and gender clashes with everyday thinking. Due to this, ordinary thinking doubts the possibility of eradicating gender via social change, because it ties sex and gender together.\n\nA defender of the conventionalist view might hold that claim (3) doesn’t really make sense either, but we are fooled into believing that it does precisely because ordinary thinking ties sex and gender together when it shouldn’t. So, if we thought about womanhood in the right way, we would see that (3) is also senseless. That would leave claim (1) where “woman” is a social notion making it akin to “US senator”. My worries about unintuitive ontological commitments are dispelled prima facie making it possible for one to cease to be a woman just by altering one’s social environment. But this raises some further questions that the defender of the conventionalist view must answer: Precisely what kind of social change would abolish women and men? Which beliefs, social conventions, linguistic practices and relations would have to be altered for one to no longer count as a woman or a man? And which social institutions, relations and structures would have to be dismantled so that women and men were to cease to exist wholesale? These questions cannot be answered in any intuitively obvious introspective manner. In fact, answering them is the stuff of feminist philosophy and a huge point of contention. Admittedly, this contention may be generated by gender being such an incredibly complex phenomenon that discerning the kind of social change that would eradicate it is extremely difficult; we may simply be ignorant of the kind of change needed, but it is possible to eradicate gender via social change. This may be so. But it may also be that feminists cannot agree on what social changes would do away with women and men because doing so just by altering one’s social environment is not possible. Bluntly put, perhaps it is just plain wrong to think that women and men’s existence ontologically depends on some social factors. I am not concluding that it is; I am merely making a strategic point. The issue of, on which social conditions the existence of women and men depends, is so intractable as to be unhelpful. If gender really is such a complex issue that it is hugely difficult (if not impossible) to articulate and agree on what sort of social change would eradicate it, the most useful move would seem to be to give up the quest. Pragmatically, feminists should not try to uncover which social factors are responsible for the existence of women and men, but, instead, should settle for the much less contentious view that human actions significantly shape the way we are as women and men. No feminist (to the best of my knowledge) denies this claim. The concerns I have raised here are not decisive and do not rule out conventionalism about gender altogether. But, as I see it, the less contentious view I have floated here is the one that feminists ought to endorse precisely because of its less contentious commitments. \n\n**The Abolitionist Implication Is Undesirable**\n\nOn views like Haslanger’s, gender is also a product of oppressive social conditions and, thus, something feminists should seek to abolish. But this abolitionist view may not be conducive to feminist interests since for ordinary thinking it harbours undesirable ontological commitments. To tease this out, contrast such abolitionist strategies with a different (what I will call) “re-evaluative” strategy. They both have the same starting point: feminism is about ending oppression that women as women face. But their ways of achieving this goal differ, which alters the strategies’ outcomes. Abolitionist accounts take womanhood to be by definition tied to oppression so that it is not possible to be a woman and not be (in some sense) oppressed. Reevaluative accounts do not take being a woman to be per se oppressive. Instead, they recognise that our social circumstances create environments where women are viewed and treated in ways that disadvantage them, perhaps by associating some traits with women and using this association to justify disadvantageous treatment. Nonetheless, by altering how women are viewed and treated it is possible to be a woman and yet not be oppressed. So, on the former view, gender justice would dismantle unjust social hierarchies thus doing away with women and men; on the latter, it would dismantle such hierarchies while retaining women and men (roughly) in a re-evaluated sense.\n\nThe strategy to follow comes down to a pragmatic political choice. But if ordinary social agents think that eradicating gender is undesirable, it may be strategically wrongheaded to endorse an account of gender that has abolitionist implications. Some anecdotal evidence supports this: my feminism students tell me time and again that they think the abolitionist strategy is aiming to eradicate something that need not be eradicated—the “feminist revolution” need not do away with gender and doing so would result in (at least some) good being unnecessarily lost. Many insist that the ways in which people are treated as woman and men is the problem feminists should focus on—being a woman or a man is not primarily the problem. And many claim to find their gender a source of positive value. After all, it is certainly true that, although one may be discriminated against due to one’s gender, it can still be something one values positively; in a similar sense, one can take pride in one’s racial group membership despite being socially disadvantaged by it. The everyday conception of gender clashes with feminist conceptions like Haslanger’s. As a result, ordinary thinking doubts the viability of eradicating gender because it sees gender as being at least partly a positive social identity rather than being a wholly negative one.\n\nProjects like Haslanger’s do, of course, start by aiming to alter the ways in which we are viewed and treated as women and men. So, in a sense, the abolitionist and re-evaluative routes go hand-in-hand to begin with. But the abolitionist strategy runs into difficulties if many social agents are unwilling to follow it through. Haslanger is asking for a significant shift in people’s self-conceptions and acknowledges that she is asking social agents to understand themselves in ways that are not ordinarily part of their gendered self-understandings (“Gender and Race” 48). In so doing, she is “call[ing] upon us to reject what seemed to be positive social identities” and to refuse to be gendered women and men (“Gender and Race” 48). I agree with Haslanger that a change in our self-understandings is called for; but I wonder if the change that she is calling for is the right kind of change given that ordinary thinking does not see the viability of eradicating gender. Again, my point is strategic: accounts that have abolitionist implications are likely to be extremely demanding. It will take a lot of convincing to make ordinary social agents view their gender as not being even in part a positive social identity and to make them refuse to be gendered women and men, if social agents do not believe to begin with that this is necessary. And, one might wonder, whether scarce feminist resources should be directed at something other than trying to convince social agents to revise their self-understandings in this manner.\n\nFortunately my students always do express a desire to see an end to gendered oppression. And clearly this is what Haslanger also wants, which may suggest that really the parties to the debate are just talking past each other. Everyone wants the same thing: gender justice. Haslanger’s rhetoric just differs from how we ordinarily talk about women and men. Usually, acknowledging this does not dispel my students’ worries; they still find it puzzling that Haslanger doesn’t use gender terms as people ordinarily do and wonder why she is confusing matters with her conception of gender. Of course, Haslanger’s rhetoric has a specific, valuable purpose: to motivate a certain kind of social and political response that undermines sexist oppression. But, given the kinds of worries I have mentioned here, strategically I think that this kind of response can be better motivated by understanding the phenomena feminists discuss under the rubric of sex and gender in a way that does not imply women and men no longer exist “after the revolution”. The worry is that accounts with abolitionist implications probably would not motivate positive social change, if this change requires that social agents must give up something they do not want to give up.\n\n**The Trait/Norm Covariance Model**\n\nThis section develops my trait/norm covariance model as an alternative to the sex/gender distinction. To begin with, it is important to note that, contrary to traditional feminist views, I do not take the term “woman” to be a purely social gender term. Ordinary speakers have, to use Ron Mallon’s terminology, indicative features in mind when they call someone a “woman”:\n\n>there is a distinction between those properties that are indicative of category membership (such as easily perceptible racial [or gender] markers), and those that are central. A property is indicative of category membership if having the property increases the likelihood that one is a member of a category. In the United States wearing a dress is indicative of being a woman ... [But w]earing a dress is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a woman.\n\n(652–3)\n\nIndicative features of womanhood include one’s appearance (clothing, hairstyles, make-up); behavioural patterns; social roles; and anatomical and bodily features (body type, shape, size, amount of body hair and how one “carries” one’s body). These features are conceivably involved in everyday gender ascriptions. Paradigmatically, feminists hold that the indicative features mentioned are not exclusively gender traits in that they include features which are taken to be paradigmatic sex traits (to do with being female or male). But, ordinary language users often deploy “woman” on the basis of anatomical sex features such as body type; “woman” is not a purely gender term for them, but (bluntly put) a mixture of sex and gender. So, ordinarily “woman” denotes individuals who are taken to possess features indicative of womanhood. This does not (and certainly should not) limit the application of “woman” to women-born-female; the term also applies to trans women, individuals “assigned male at birth whose gender presentation may be construed as ‘unambiguously’ female” (Bettcher 46), who call themselves “women”.\n\nMy contention is that feminists should use the term “woman” as ordinarily as possible. And the trait/norm covariance model that I will outline next will be sensitive to these reflections about ordinary language use. The model I am proposing deals roughly with the same phenomena that the sex/gender distinction does. It just understands that phenomena in a different way that is, I submit, more fruitful in being more congenial to everyday thinking. On my view, we redraw the boundaries of the sets of gender traits and sex traits giving up the labels “sex” and “gender” to denote those traits. Instead, the traits are divided into sets of descriptive traits and evaluative norms. The former (in a sense) describe “the way the world is” and include physical and anatomical traits (e.g., chromosomes, ovaries, testes, genitalia, body shape and size), one’s appearance (e.g., one’s clothing, make-up, haircut, amount of body hair), roles (e.g., whether one undertakes caretaking roles, engages in childrearing tasks) and self-conceptions (calling oneself a woman or a man). These are features of which there are “facts of the matter”—it isn’t in any sense mysterious or down to value judgements whether one has ovaries, undertakes childrearing tasks, or calls oneself a woman. (This does not mean that values were not involved in singling out descriptive features, like anatomical traits, or that descriptive features are not socially malleable; but more on this shortly.) Evaluative norms are to do with stereotypical judgements: whether one is judged to be, to appear to be and/or to act in ”feminine”, ”masculine” or “neutral” ways. Evaluative norms attributed reflect value judgements and cultural norms. So, on my and the paradigmatic feminist schemas:\n\n Paradigmatic feministmodel|.. |Trait/normcovariancemodel | ..\n--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------\nSex\t               |Gender                 |Descriptive traits\t   |Evaluative norms\nHaving ovaries\t|Wearing make-up |Having ovaries\t           |Being “feminine”\n\t                |Being “feminine”   |Wearing make-up\t|\n\nWhat does it mean to say that evaluative norms covary with descriptive traits? Just that we take certain traits to be of certain kind. So, the trait/norm covariance relation is constituted by particular descriptive traits being viewed in a particular manner by us. I take “femininity” to mean “associated with women”, “masculinity” to mean “associated with men” and “neutrality” to mean “associated with neither or both”. That is, depending on how we view particular descriptive traits, they either covary with femininity, masculinity or neutrality. And certain trait/norm pairings are currently linked to women, others to men and still others to neither or both. They can be so linked in a global or (more often than not) in a local manner. For instance, being short-sighted is globally neutral: as far as I know, the trait is nowhere associated exclusively with either women or men thereby globally covarying with neutrality. Then again, possession of testes appears to be globally masculine, possession of ovaries globally feminine. Quite often, though, the trait/norm pairings are local differing from one context to the next and depending on social and cultural factors. So, although all cultures have traits that covary with femininity and others that covary with masculinity, the configurations of these trait/norm pairings can differ depending on their location. To illustrate, take long hair. In many UK communities it is no longer strongly associated with women and often covaries with neutrality. However, in UK Asian-Indian communities that do not consider it appropriate for those picked out by “woman” to have short hair, having long hair covaries more strongly with femininity. But, of course, other social and cultural axes affect this covariance relation even within a culture: in many UK Indian Sikh contexts, neither men nor women are expected to cut their hair, which suggests that (in these social contexts) having long hair covaries with neutrality. However, in these contexts, other practices to do with hair covary with femininity and masculinity, like the practice of Sikh men wearing turbans. The trait/norm pairings are interrelated: with those picked out by “man”, the pairing “having long hair/neutrality” is interrelated with “wearing a turban/masculinity”; but for those picked out by “woman” the former pairing is not interrelated with the latter pairing. (For more on Asian social conventions to do with hair, see Hiltebeitel and Miller.) The trait/norm covariance relations can also change over time. Wearing trousers is a good example: until quite recently in many Western Anglo-European contexts, masculinity covaried with it. But, relatively quickly, in many contexts it has become neutral. It is now socially acceptable for someone ordinarily picked out by “woman” to wear trousers. The same social value is no longer attached to this trait. Of course, this all further demonstrates that the ways in which the trait/norm covariance relations pan out are not always straightforward. Since the relations depend on beliefs and conventions that change over time and place, they will usually be manifestations of some local and contextspecific beliefs and conventions. There are many complications not least because of differences in contexts and in what norms social agents project on descriptive traits. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that sometimes seeing how the relations pan out is not complicated and that sometimes social agents do not differ significantly in their ascriptions of norms.\n\nI have said that certain descriptive traits covary with certain evaluative norms, but what explains this covariance relation? I take the existence of this relation to be a thoroughly mind-dependent matter. If you like, wearing make-up and engaging in child-care (to name two descriptive traits) are not inherently or mind-independently feminine–that femininity covaries with them is something that depends for its existence on social factors and obtains because of us. The classification scheme of feminine, masculine and neutral evaluative norms is a strong pragmatic construction; that is, social factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent accurately any “facts of the matter” (Haslanger, “Ontology and Social Construction” 100). So, the classification scheme does not pick out any mind-independent facts about descriptive traits. That some traits are viewed as feminine, masculine or neutral is a consequence of “human-made” fashions, styles, cultural beliefs, social conventions and linguistic practices, which determine what features are judged to be of what kind. The classification scheme of feminine/masculine/neutral is a mere social construction. Furthermore, this scheme tends to be hierarchal in grading traits; this is evident from the devaluing of many activities and features with which femininity covaries (like the devaluing of caretaking work).\n\nOn my model the claim “Jane is feminine because Jane wears make-up” does not capture any mind-independent fact about the world. Yet, my model also takes wearing make-up to be a descriptive trait of which there is “a fact of the matter”. So, it appears that saying Jane wears make-up does capture something mind-independent about the world. It is worth clarifying the notion of mind-independence here to avoid an air of inconsistency. Consider driving. In the United Kingdom, people drive on the left-hand side of the road; in the United States, they drive on the right. Which convention is the correct or true one? We cannot say because the context-specific conventions that govern driving are mind-dependent: they depend for their existence on productive human social practices and require that certain human-made background conditions are in place. Such conventions are, of course, mutable. The UK government could just decide to alter conventions governing driving. Obviously doing so in practice would be hugely difficult and certainly no easy feat. But the point is that ultimately conventions come down to us—there is no mind-independent fact about which side of the road is the correct side for driving. However, that people drive on the left in the United Kingdom is mind-independent in another sense. When I state “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” I am stating something that is true mind-independently: the truth of the statement is not (if you like) up for grabs. I cannot just decide that the statement is false and drive on the right. (Or, I could, but probably with quite tragic results.) So, given certain background conditions, it is a mind-independent fact that in the United Kingdom people drive on the left irrespective of the fact that the convention to drive on the left is minddependent.\n\nThe descriptive trait of wearing make-up is akin to the convention of driving on the left: it is mind-dependent in that it is a trait that depends for its existence on particular human-made social conditions (it requires that certain human-made background conditions are in place). The trait is also socially mutable: wearing make-up might, for example, go out of fashion thus prompting people to abandon the practice. Nonetheless, that Jane wears make-up is (in another sense) mind-independent. The truth or falsity of the statement “Jane wears make-up” is not up for grabs: either she does or she doesn’t. This is akin to the claim “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left”: however mind-dependent—due to productive human activities— the respective conventions (to drive on the left and to wear make-up) are, whether the statements “Jane wears make-up” and “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” are true or false is not open to debate given our current conventions. By contrast, the claim “The convention to drive on the left is better than the convention to drive on the right” is utterly mind-dependent. Whether this statement is thought to be true or false depends on one’s view or opinion, in addition to the convention to drive on the left being a product of human social practices. \n\nNow, although it is a mind-independent feature of reality that Jane wears makeup, that Jane acts in a feminine way because she wears make-up is mind-dependent. It does not capture any mind-independent facts about the world, like some supposed fact that the practice of wearing make-up is inherently feminine. That femininity covaries with wearing make-up is mind-dependent obtaining due to productive human activities—because of us. This further illustrates that the trait/norm covariance relation is not a causal relation in the sense that the former causes the latter.\n\nChildcare activities or the practice of wearing make-up do not cause femininity to covary with them; rather, our beliefs and judgements cause this. To illustrate, think about morality. Standardly moral philosophers agree that the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness. But does the act cause moral goodness? This depends on one’s metaethical commitments. For some moral realists, the answer might be yes: the act of giving to charity instantiates a realist (non-natural) moral property of goodness. So, the act of giving to charity literally causes moral goodness to pop up in the world because one’s actions instantiate the property of goodness. For moral constructivists, however, the answer might be no: the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness because we project moral goodness onto the act of giving to charity. Roughly, we have constructed a moral world in which giving to charity is considered good. So, the relation between giving to charity and moral goodness is not a causal one in that the former causes the latter. That giving to charity is considered to be morally good is down to us. The same appears to be true of what I have said about descriptive traits and evaluative norms: we have constructed a gendered world in which childcare and wearing make-up are considered to be feminine. That is, we— human social agents—are responsible for these covariance relations. And this being fortunately the case, we can also alter them so that childcare, for instance, no longer covaries with femininity.\n\n[continued below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6yp60e/ontological_commitments_sex_and_gender_by_mari/dmp1uid/)",

    "text": "Should I stay or Should I go?  Greetings, \n\nI'm going to try and keep this as vague as possible without straying too far from the point. I am 30 years old originally from the U.S and I moved to a European country to take a job in an industry I truly love. I can say the industry is in communications/marketing. The pay is low, 20,000E per year and I get paid on a monthly basis. \n\n  Ive been here about 10 months and things have gotten downright awful.  Moving to a new country to begin with was very difficult and initially this was the only concern. My paychecks also come from the UK, despite the fact that the company I work for is in Southern Europe, all of my fellow employees are paid from a bank account in that country \"But I doubt I can prove that, or whether it's relevant. \n\n  It started with the language barrier, despite the fact that EVERYONE in the office speaks English, 90% of our customer base speaks English they switched over to their mother tongue. The boss did the same thing, and it got so constant that it's gotten to the point where I just sit at my desk and wait for the day to end. \n\n Ive tried to have it stop, to no avail. Ive asked nicely, \"Guys please can we speak English in the office\" to even calling the companys CEO who has been very clear that only English should be spoken in the office.  The manager of the office seems to particularly dislike me, speaking the native language in my presence all the time, making fun of me for not speaking it and just being generally rude. Hey I get it, I'm in another country and should learn that language, but that takes a lot longer than most people realize and I don't understand why English can't be spoken when we communicate internally with management in English ALL the time, and with our customers. Suffice it to say ive realized it's something I can't change, so now I just tune out.  Boss also likes to take everyone out to lunch, well, everyone except me of course. But that's not it \n\n As an example, I was given the company credit card to purchase some software however the price differential on the software was pretty significant 100, 200, 500, 1000 etc.  So I simply asked the boss, \"which should I buy\"? In his native tongue he said \"How the fuck should I know\" I kind of wanted to ask him the same thing, but oh well. On another occasion I thought he was calling my name, so I turned around and said \"Yes?\" and he said \"I wasn't speaking to you! I was speaking to xxxxx\" in a really nasty way, and of course he was speaking in his native tongue. \n\n This is only one of many situations ive found myself in with him, and at this point I don't feel a part of the \"team\" at all, which is why he said it was so important I didn't work independently, but moved all the way across the ocean to work at THIS location. \n\n  So now let's get into the nitty gritty, because I could probably go on for hours.  I am 30 years old, my job  history is bleak to say the least, but not non-existent.  There are a few things working in my favor, one of those things is that my family owns an entire apartment in a neighboring country, however we aren't wealthy, it's just an investment that's payed off. \n\n Technically I could leave this job and not pay any rent at all if I move to that country. The issue is, I would be without a job and maybe in an even more stressful situation than I am now. I'd also like any advice at all on how to deal with a nasty manager, and coworkers who clearly don't really want me around. \n\n Starting new in that country would be tough, unlike the one I am currently in it's job market is a bit worse and generally few \"English Speakers\" are hired outside of the tourist industry. However life in the country is much less expensive than the one I am currently in. That being said, I have a few ideas for home businesses that could at the very least keep me fed but I do fear that my lack of experience in general could make finding a new job rather difficult. \n\n Any advice would be helpful, and of course as the title suggests should I stay or should I go?",

    "text": "how do i continue after my first job situation? Hi Guys \n\nHere is a story about first “real” job after having finished my university degree within finance and management. \n\nPlease comment and ask some critical questions to help me reflect on the situation I got into. \n\nAlso I would like to know how to sell myself in the future. \n\nMy entry to the company\n\nIn August 2016 I started to work in a larger European diary company and started in the Scandinavian headquarter in Stockholm that is responsible for the product milk. Julius and Romeo hired me as an intern. Julius is the CEO of the business unit and is a very confident man with a MBA from Harvard. In his unit he had Romeo to lead the project department, this for example entails to take ideas and make them market ready. \n\nA year ago, Romeo received the assignment to make one idea market ready and he hired me as an intern so support him in the process. In the beginning of my entry I felt very excited because Romeo enabled me to being an entrepreneur in larger conglomerate. He had an endless backlog of tasks and I received the mandate to solve them solely. By that I mean tasks such as developing a go-2-market strategy, developing product requirements, developing the value proposition and doing pricing. \n\nAlso the supervision was extremely well organized. In the beginning Romeo and I had brief but very frequent talks in order to align. This was very helpful because we both needed to build trust. After a month or two I was so deep in the project that I did not require so much supervision anymore so Romeo trusted me to drive the business development of the product. Through Romeo I received great reputation in the business unit and Julius also started to give me some lightweight tasks that I mastered. \n\nMy internship however was limited to a specific time period. Romeo and I had few good talks about my future, and he hoped that I would continue in the company. \n\nAs such I was not reluctant to stay in the company as I had a great time and enjoyed the both Julius and Romeo as they were excellent boss’s. However I wanted to move to Copenhagen to go back to my friends and girlfriend. \n\nLuckily we had an operational site in Copenhagen, both Julius and Romeo talked with the local director in Copenhagen and they gave me the opportunity to start in Copenhagen.\n\nThe transfer to Copenhagen\n\nIn February 2017 Niklas the local director hired me.  I received the task to continue on the business development of the product that worked on in Stockholm and to work on some corporate development tasks. That meant that I closely with the sales department looked into sales targets and strategic partners. Together with one sales manager we created meetings with top clients and interesting partners for the product. \n\nHaving talked to Romeo, he was very excited. He loved that the Danish operational site created a good outlook for his project. \nFurthermore, I started to work on the corporate development project. I have a finance degree that means I had the theory in place however I looked for some guidance from Niklas to get start this project.  \n\nHowever a few months after I started Niklas started to neglect giving me the guidance and whenever he looked over it I received bad feedback. I checked with other financial analysts in the company and they actually liked my work. Additionally Niklas blocked any further development on the business development of the product even though Romeo and Julius loved the progress. \n\n8 months after I started at the Danish operational site I got fired due to mismatch between me and Niklas. I learned a few days afterwards that Romeo and Niklas hate each other and feels that I have been in the middle of a political battleground.",

    "text": "Working at a Start Up for 3 Months - Need to find a new job (info inside), how to address this in CV? Hi, \n\nApologies on the length.\n\n**My background:**\nI'm based in Europe. I left a large IT corporation in May to find a new job (boss was verbally abusive, not a good company to work for, very well known American brand). Frustratingly I fell quite sick, my father was also hospitalised and both made finding a job quickly a challenge. Three months later I interviewed for an ambitious company for a Head of Sales role.\n\n**Job Desc:**\nThe company is European in origin. \nResponsibilities: develop sales/BD processes, GTM/strategy, evaluate IT solutions for Sales/after sales (CRM/Service), acquire customers directly until we can hire a team, find and acquire partners\n\n**The last two months:**\nSo I joined that start up company as Head of Sales alongside two founders and things have been going well - lots of learning on the job, hit the ground running, start building a pipeline (they had a very healthy inflow of high quality leads - which surprised me).\n\nHowever due to financial problems (in short, an unexpected customer attrited this month: this was not related to me at all or even a problem with us (something that no one could solve, despite wanting to). It essentially equalled the value of new business in two months) will be let go by the end of the month if things do not improve. The founders stressed none of this is my fault, that the working relationship and work ethic is exactly what they were looking for, but they simply cannot afford to keep me unless the company (not me) manages to recoup the losses. \n\n**Next four weeks:**\nMy mindset is simply find a new job, evaluate it if I get an offer versus the situation in this company at that time. I will weight an external offer higher as I'm not keen on a company that does not give me stability. \n\nHowever before I apply, I need to get my CV and Cover Letter in order and right now I'm sitting here gazing stupidly at my computer with the most pathetic 'writers block'.\n\n**My Questions:**\n\nProblem in one line: I have a gap on my CV and a short term employment with a \"senior\" title\n  \nHow do I address the following in my CV?  \n- It's only 3 months, this will look as if I have been let go (solution: address in Cover Letter?) or am jumping ship\n- I haven't completed many of my advertised responsibilities. I can't even exaggerate here. I'm struggling to put anything in this section\n- My title - it's very senior, the caveat is it was at a start up which makes it more understandable. If I lasted 6 months, 12 months or two years this would be no issue. My question here is: I will be applying back to standard corporate roles - but with a \"senior\" title and short length on my CV - this looks comical. Should I \"downgrade\" to a very generic \"Sales\" or something similar?\n- If I \"downgrade\" my title, it's still 2-3 months at a start up with little to show, and \"just another sales title\". \n\n-My girlfriend is pushing for me to \"extend\" the start date back to when I left my previous company (fill the gap of 3 months), which would allow for \"wiggle room\" in describing what I did (exaggerated or not). I'm not keen on lying, even if they don't manage to find out, but I'm struggling to think of anything else here because despite the truth being OK, it's more difficult to explain and even justify. \n\nPeople don't want to listen to a complex story, simple as. An exaggerated story of being Head of Sales at a start up for 6 months (not 2-3) that had funding issues is easier to explain than \"I left to find something new, fell sick, found a job as Head of Sales, there were funding issues\" - it sounds like I bounced from job to job or was fired from two despite being true. \n\nAny advice for how to address this in a CV or a Cover Letter would be appreciated.",

She could go back to her country and come meet me after 3 months (which would make her legal in her return) but she would be unable to work during the entire period I would be working there which could be many years.\n\nThe second option, which was what we took, involved trying to make her legal in my country by entering in a stable union (like a marriage) which would allow her to then be legal and work when we went together. The manager (would be boss) was very generous and allowed me to delay the start of the job for 4 months later to attempt to solve the situation this way. We tried to do it and were unable to make it work due to the stable union not being recognized due to her being ilegal (even though our lawyers said it should be), and the same when we tried to marry. So she went back to her country and came back a bit over 3 months after. \n\nThe day of my departure came and I had everything ready to go. On the morning of the flight my documents were stolen so I was unable to travel and since it was during the vacations period the bureaucratic procedures in my country work very slowly so my entry was delayed, first for 2 weeks and then the human resources told me it was for a month for their own internal procedures. \n\nBack to the girlfriend situation. She had gone to her country and after a few weeks we found out she was pregnant. We decided to keep the pregnancy as she would have a lot of difficulty having a kid later on as she has PCOS. She came back to my country 2 days before my departure date and, it could be from the stress of changing countries, she had a miscarriage. It affected her brutally due to the high probability of not being able to have kids later on, she went out of her mind and made up her mind that she would be unable to feel ok if we went due to what happened as she would be deeply depressed and be very isolated due to my job involving many hours out of home. \n\nGoing alone would mean she could not stay in my country either and wait until she felt better, as she came with a visa to marry and the marriage process would take long. If I went she would have to go with me against her will or go back to her country. At the time the situation was such that I had to decide between breaking the relationship, or staying.\n\nWith all the drama and my family pressure (they never wanted me to go) I panicked and sent an email explaining briefly the situation saying I couldnt go at the time and couldnt ask for another delay as it was a third one and it didnt feel right to ask for that reason (huge mistake, should have asked of course but was not thinking clearly). A few days later I sent an email asking for a delay of 2 months to try to solve the situation. I received a reply a week after saying the job was cancelled. After around a week I sent an email to the manager apologising again and explaining the situation with a bit more detail because I felt it was the least I could do.\n\nNow after around 3 months they opened a job slot that is very similar to what I had applied. I want it, a lot, and I'm a good fit for it. What I fear is that (understandably) they view me as unprofessional, that Im not trustworthy and that they doubt my commitment. I understand that, as the whole story is very complicated and the fact is that I gave my word that I would go (despite no contract being signed), and 3 times on the date that I was supposed to go I had to ask for a delay. I feel ashamed of that and I have always been a man of word, but the situation involving my family affected me too much emotionally that I didnt think clearly. I have learned my lesson now, at great cost due to the opportunities missed.\n\nWhat could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited?\n\nAt the time of the interview I was asked about my commitment and I gave my word that if they offered me the job I would go. I kept my word up to the point of the family issues. Between the time of the interview and the first starting date I was called for interviews for two jobs at a great international organization that offered even better pay and was at a better location, and for another job in switzerland that offered even better pay. I refused on the spot to keep my word. After a few months I was offered a teaching job in my city and refused for the same reason. Now I'm unemployed and with a high probability of remaining so as the job market for phds is seasonal, most job are to start in September next year.\n\nI will apply for the position, but I'm not sure on the following:\nShould I mention any of this even briefly in the cover letter?\nShould I try to show them I keep my word and this was an exception because it impacted my personal life tremendously? Should I contact the manager (would be boss) directly and mention any of this? For example by mentioning I refused the other job interviews\n\nTL DR: got a great job offer a year ago, for 3 times had to ask for delay (months) in the starting work date for family reasons (and one time for documents stolen) and the job was cancelled. Now a similar job opened and I want to apply. What could I do to try to restore my credibility and make them believe I'm commited? In terms of the cover letter and potentially contacting the manager (would be boss) directly",

    "text": "A feminist rollercoaster It's just about today at work. I have three kids and I work at an urgent pharmacy thats open alongside the urgent doctors at night, from 6-11. Great, dont miss out on the kids much because of work and get to really help with people.\n\nNice, apart from at least one man a day mistaking compassionate and competent care with personal admiration of their manly being and come at me with - what they feel flirty, what I feel derogatory comments.\n\n-May I help you in anything else?\n\n- Not in a medical sense, no.\n\nor\n\n-If you don't remember what medicine you have at home, we're here until 11, you can give us a call.\n\n- Huh, that's the best way to get you number, hey?\n\n\nLike what the flying fuck?\n\n\nOkay.\n\nSo I am attractive woman (with you know, having been shot in the ass in the morning with antibiotics for a PID that I got infected with while being scanned for infertility after I lost my baby last year and still debating if I should be at hospital with this pain) and if that's what they chose to see instead of a health professional, I make them pay, and god help me, I sell each man with a remark like this at least one OTC product. \n\n\nBut then an elderly gentlemen comes in, and after handing in his script, he jovially asks me (clearly savouring the social situation):\n\n- And where are YOU from? (I blend in until I speak, I have an accent).\n\n- I was born in this Eastern European country, but, you know... I am living here.\n\n- For how long have you been here?\n\n- For a decade.\n\n- And you still have an accent? - wtf?! but I just laugh, I had been looking for someone to teach me to speak \"locally\" for exactly 10 years too.\n\n- Yeah, I know, terrible, I don't seem to be able to loose it.\n\n- Ah, and when you go home, they will think you speak fancy! - I started gaping here. There is no counting in how many ways this is wrong.\n\n- Well, this is home for me now, I am not going back.\n\n- Ah right, the scenery is surely... ammm... nicer\n\n- Yes, and the people.\n\n\nGuy goes and sits down to wait. My kind and up-front collegue says:\n\n-Pumada, do you think men ask you more often where you are from than women?\n\n- Generally no, but here, now that you say it, yes.\n\n- I just think they do. Men are fascinated with you. - I blush badly and I rarely do, I have Aspergers - I don't mean it in any bad way, it's just that you are different... That's not what I mean, I mean...\n\n- You mean my accent?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nI explain to her how I feel about casual racism, how I am not comfortable with the culture I accidently was born into, how I feel the question \"where are you from\" excludes me from where I really belong and how I feel upset about not being asked about my feelings before assumptions are made about my identity based on where I was friggin BORN. How the fuck could I have done anything about it? I left as soon as I could. Anyway I didn't swear at work obviously.\n\nI also said how I'd hate my accent and casual racism etc. be degraded to be just a thing between men and women. Right, convo over, time's up, guy's getting his medicine. I never compromise the quality of advice I give on personal feelings so I explain his medicines and he feels comfortable - as he should, that's how I am a professional, my baggage doesn't belong to customers.\n\nThen he says goodby to a professional who just made sure he and his wife are safe with their medicines, who has a masters in pharmacology, has published in neurological research, who registered her diploma in another language and another culture and has been offering exceptional healthcare and management for the past 15 years, he says goodby as he feels best:\n\n- Night-night, kiwi girl.",

    "text": "Data behind ACLS guidelines for medicines From time to time (but certainly no less than weekly, with the last one being [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6hi5ya/not_medical_advice_1mg_epinephrine_ivp_during/?ref=share&ref_source=link)) threads pop up where the ACLS guidelines come into play. Sometimes because someone didn't follow them, sometimes because someone claimed they were followed the wrong way.\n\nWe rarely discuss why we have the guidelines we have, and never if this constitutes the standard of care, if it is evidence based guidelines or if it is a list of what some people think you should do.\n\nThe latter is true, and it is actually based on animal studies during the 60ies, namely [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from asphyxia.* JAMA. 1962 Oct 20;182:283-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13973494/) and [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Drug therapy.* JAMA. 1968 Jan 22;203(4):255-60.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5694097/) where the second one found\n\n> Resuscitation [of dogs] was more successful when epinephrine was used than when no drug therapy or sodium bicarbonate were used. \n\n**Vasopressors**\n\nThe ACLS algorithm since at least 2009 have included adrenaline/epinephrine 1mg every 3-5 minutes. This is based on a single randomized study ([Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. *Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.* Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533) which is best summarized by their own conclusion\n\n> Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.\n\nROSC isn't the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. [Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. *Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956) which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.\n\nAnother study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per [Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. *Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.* BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638)  \nIt is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt\n> In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (>50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.\n\n**The AHA guidelines**\n\nThe ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the [AHA guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/).  They say\n> It is **reasonable to consider** administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.\n\nReasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. \n\nI would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn't follow protocol is hard for me to say. \n\n**Amiodarone**\n\nThere are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). \n\nThe first of these two, [Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. *Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287) found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial ([Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. *Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418) showed the same, but didn't focus on survival to hospital discharge.\n\nTherefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  \n> Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.\n\n**Edit 1.** /u/transmogrification pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, [Kudenchuk PJ et al. *Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest*. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165). This study concludes that\n\n> neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\nbut also\n\n> Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.\n\nSo there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn't support an effect larger than 3%.\n\n**Fibrinolysis**\n\nA lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don't actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn't been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see [Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. *Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.* N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151) and [Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. *Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.* Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646).\n\nIf we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).\n\n**Edit 2** As pointed out by the PEAPETT study [Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. *Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the \"PEAPETT\" study).* Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214) and /u/macreadyrj there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn't the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn't show any significant bleedings. \n\n**Sodium bicarb**\n\nThe AHA states\n> There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.\n\nAnd the study this is based at least partly on [Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. *Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest*. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643) which despite the name states\n> **The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.** However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (>15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.\n\nIt should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it's use, but routinely using it simply hasn't been shown effective as stated by the AHA\n> In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial\n\n**Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation** \n\nPer the AHA\n> However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.\n\nThere aren't any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; [Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. *Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest*. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157) and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) [Gausche M, Lewis RJ. *Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children*. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643).\n\nA more recent study in Japan [Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. *Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764) found that\n> Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.\n\nYou also have another study, [Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. *Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431) which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn't. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.\n\n**Edit 4**\nThanks to dr /u/CytokineShitStorm for pointing me to this study, [Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. *Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival*. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660) which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found\n>Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.\n\nand thus it doesn't support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn't tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient. \n\n**Summary**\nHigh quality CPR and defibrillate as soon as possible. The rest is mostly guesses.",

    "text": "[M27]My second year of teaching has been an absolute nightmare. close to giving up. Hello, fresh European teacher here. This might be a wall of text, but would appreciate any input. After i finished my education i went to work at a school close to my hometown. Although my class was not the easiest, especially one kid was out of control a lot of times, i really felt like i did a good job my first year. My colleagues were amazing, the working enviroment was great, and i really cared for my pupils by the end of the year. Unfortunately my position was only temporarily, so i started looking for jobs elsewhere. After getting some enouraging advice from a friend living in a city, i got a job offer from there and decided to take it. So i packed my stuff and went to a city quite far from where i grew up. I was excited.\n\nI teach a 7th grade in a primary school, on a team with a teacher-student and an assistant. I noticed very early on that something is just \"off\" about this school. Terrible structure, lack of resources, awful leadership and a split working-enviroment. But worst of all is my class. I have \"only\" 19 students, but of these students, six of them are a complete nightmare. They are all potentially aggressive, ADD, learning problems, lacks respect, and pretty much requires someone to look after them most of the time to be able to get anything done.\n\nThe teacher-student i'm working with, is often gone for a week or even several weeks in a row, and the assistant also frequently. Add to this, the teacher-student is the most obnoxious person i've ever worked with, and it's pretty much impossible to get to an agreement with her. She acts as if she owns the school, takes control, very rarely look prepared for her lessons, and she doesn't do any planning when she goes away, meaning more work for me. I was never told this was going to be my working situation when i accepted the position. When one of them or both of them are away, the administration doesn't replace them. I am left alone, with these kids that are pretty much just doing whatever they want.\n\nTo describe a typical lesson: Sometimes i have to use 10-15 mins just to get the class quiet and focused. These six students i have mentioned, pretty much think they can do whatever they want. They walk out of the classroom, roam the hallways, disturb the lesson by being loud/not raising their hands. Some days they are more of a handful than others. For example, if some of them have a particulary uneasy day, they could lock doors if i go out of the classroom, erase stuff from the whiteboard, put chairs in front of the door and just go around the school doing naughty stuff. So you can probably imagine having to deal with these particular students, and still at the same time manage 13 others. The behavior of these students also infect on some of the \"good kids\", which results in them being more uneasy as well. At the moment, i feel completely helpless and i look like a bloody idiot trying to teach this class. I get no respect, and very little support from my administration.\n\nSo you're probably wondering if i have just been letting them do whatever they want without trying anything. We've had several meetings with their parents and external organizing, but i feel like what is being discussed is always what WE can do better, or that WE are not doing a good enough job with these kids etc. I have literally handed them stuff on a silver platter, going head over heals to plan the lessons so that they can be taken care of, but they just DO NOT CARE AT ALL.\n\nA few months ago i contacted my union representative (not sure this is what you call it) and just told everything about my concerns and frustration. She has been amazing support and the case has been a high priority. I've had meetings with my boss, discussing things etc, but things are just not happening. I am starting to become completely miserable at work, and every day is about surviving, not learning. In my opinion, some of these kids shouldn't even be allowed to participate in my lessons, they act like they are at home. I have already applied for a transfer next year, or i might just move from the city. I still have to last out this year though, and it's going to be a nightmare. Any advice on what i should do? I have decided to meet with my boss to tell her i'm putting my foot down, and that this can't continue.\n\nThere is a lot between the lines here that i can tell more about if it's necessary. I just thought i wouldn't completely drown you in text.",

    "text": "how do i continue after my first job situation? Hi Guys \n\nHere is a story about first “real” job after having finished my university degree within finance and management. \n\nPlease comment and ask some critical questions to help me reflect on the situation I got into. \n\nAlso I would like to know how to sell myself in the future. \n\nMy entry to the company\n\nIn August 2016 I started to work in a larger European diary company and started in the Scandinavian headquarter in Stockholm that is responsible for the product milk. Julius and Romeo hired me as an intern. Julius is the CEO of the business unit and is a very confident man with a MBA from Harvard. In his unit he had Romeo to lead the project department, this for example entails to take ideas and make them market ready. \n\nA year ago, Romeo received the assignment to make one idea market ready and he hired me as an intern so support him in the process. In the beginning of my entry I felt very excited because Romeo enabled me to being an entrepreneur in larger conglomerate. He had an endless backlog of tasks and I received the mandate to solve them solely. By that I mean tasks such as developing a go-2-market strategy, developing product requirements, developing the value proposition and doing pricing. \n\nAlso the supervision was extremely well organized. In the beginning Romeo and I had brief but very frequent talks in order to align. This was very helpful because we both needed to build trust. After a month or two I was so deep in the project that I did not require so much supervision anymore so Romeo trusted me to drive the business development of the product. Through Romeo I received great reputation in the business unit and Julius also started to give me some lightweight tasks that I mastered. \n\nMy internship however was limited to a specific time period. Romeo and I had few good talks about my future, and he hoped that I would continue in the company. \n\nAs such I was not reluctant to stay in the company as I had a great time and enjoyed the both Julius and Romeo as they were excellent boss’s. However I wanted to move to Copenhagen to go back to my friends and girlfriend. \n\nLuckily we had an operational site in Copenhagen, both Julius and Romeo talked with the local director in Copenhagen and they gave me the opportunity to start in Copenhagen.\n\nThe transfer to Copenhagen\n\nIn February 2017 Niklas the local director hired me.  I received the task to continue on the business development of the product that worked on in Stockholm and to work on some corporate development tasks. That meant that I closely with the sales department looked into sales targets and strategic partners. Together with one sales manager we created meetings with top clients and interesting partners for the product. \n\nHaving talked to Romeo, he was very excited. He loved that the Danish operational site created a good outlook for his project. \nFurthermore, I started to work on the corporate development project. I have a finance degree that means I had the theory in place however I looked for some guidance from Niklas to get start this project.  \n\nHowever a few months after I started Niklas started to neglect giving me the guidance and whenever he looked over it I received bad feedback. I checked with other financial analysts in the company and they actually liked my work. Additionally Niklas blocked any further development on the business development of the product even though Romeo and Julius loved the progress. \n\n8 months after I started at the Danish operational site I got fired due to mismatch between me and Niklas. I learned a few days afterwards that Romeo and Niklas hate each other and feels that I have been in the middle of a political battleground.",

    "text": "Hello! Looking for career advice! What path would you recommend? Hello!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and 3 years and 2 months of experience in QA Software Testing. I really liked the job I did - test products that the company periodically came up with for sale, Coffee Beans, Travel and Living, I liked the products more than the actual job of testing (websites, backend entries, product flow), and I enjoyed \"client\" communications (I worked in an offshore establishment) and within the team, as compared to the technical task at hand. Especially the few \"product\" meetings that we attended, which put the developer to sleep, but I totally enjoyed sitting there, understanding the nitty-gritties that went into product development.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I was wondering if there was some path I could take into Product development? I am currently on a sabbatical, took time off work last April to sort some personal stuff, and to think about where to go. I'm ready to come back into action, and was wondering what would be the right direction to approach this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShould I take a degree in Product Management? I couldn't find many on Quora apart from MBAs which a lot of people didn't recommend, quoting experience as a better candidate. I don't live in North America, or Europe (Preferred locations, I live in Asia), and I think higher education is the best way into these countries. I'm fine with any European or North American country, though I would love it if it were in America, or Scotland (LOVE the countryside!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm also open to any other recommendations that you may have with respect to career paths, I'm pretty much open to anything. I don't have a \"this is how it is supposed to be\", as long as I enjoy the task at hand - solving problems, guiding a product through to completion, communicating with the team, having a good time!, I'm okay with pretty much anything, as long as it has growth and stability, from personal responsibilities point of view. I'm not particular about \"fast\" or \"slow\" paced jobs, any pace would do, as long as it was engaging, fun, and gave me enough to take care of my responsibilities and peace. Any other responsibilities that went with the job, like late night calls, sudden product disruptions, long weeks leading up to a release, and working from home on Holidays, are totally okay!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy profile summary is as below, what would you recommend I do? There are opportunities in my country to pick up where I left off, but the competition is stiff, and I am not keen to pick up with the same role, which is why I'm asking about the degrees/programmes, also I can afford to pay for them, plus I'm 27 and would love to get started right away with a move, but it looks like in order to do this, I will need either time (and luck, in my country, to approach this from a professional point of view), or a degree in the country of interest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat would be some good degrees/programmes to pursue? Does the University matter? What certifications should I also consider? What are the opportunities in these areas (North America, Scotland, and Europe), like? Are there some other paths you would recommend to Product Management?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nProfile Summary (Most Recent, first):\n&nbsp;\n\n* 3+ Years of Total IT Industry experience as Software Tester in Agile/Scrum\n&nbsp;\n\n* 1+ Years of Marketing/Client Communications in a Startup\n&nbsp;\n\n* 6 Months of Marketing Internship in an Educational Institution\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeel free to ask for any additional details, will be ready to share!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks!",

I'm 29, American, about 4 years work experience.\n\nBachelors in Political Science, Masters in East Asian Studies, both from decent state schools, top 50. Grades were decent, 3.33 undergrad, 3.87 graduate, though they could have been better. Full time work and studies don't go so well together. All my academic studies were geopolitical and financial system focused, with an emphasis on China.\n\nAs part of the bachelor's and master's degrees, I spent 2 academic years in China. Then worked there in the education marketing field for a British company for another 2 years. From this, plus the academics, I speak fluent Mandarin, and have a strong understanding of Chinese culture.\n\nI came back to the US, and used my small savings to start a company. It had initial interest from some investors, which spurred me to really give it some serious thought, but the investments fell through and I poured my savings into it thinking if one investor showed interest, another must be interested as well. Didn't work out that way.\n\nAfter that folded, I spent 6 months or so scraping by and applying for jobs constantly, and fell bassackwards into a position. Initially I thought it was a short term consulting role where the owner of a small manufacturer in the Chicago region wanted me to accompany him as a \"spy\" on a business trip to China with him. Things sort of escalated quickly and I took a full time role as the China regional manager for this smallish company out in the boonies south of Chicago. I told him that this wasn't what I was looking to do longterm from the outset, and agreed to help him reform his businesses China operations. I spent one year doing this, found new dealers, renegotiated the contracts, fired the deadweight, stopped the dirt, redid the Chinese marketing materials, and hired on some long term talent to take over and trained them up.\n\nAfter one year, I shifted over to a part time position, as sort of an on call consultant, in addition to whatever else might be needed, because I was going to go back to school for economics. I did not, sadly, get accepted to the programs I applied for. I applied for \"Ivy League\" level European Universities, because I already have a master's degree, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense to get a second unless it comes with the networking potential of a top tier school. Thus I'm in a pickle. I have a year before the next intake for schools, with no guarantee again that I would even get in. I have rent to pay, and zero interest in continuing in my current job.\n\nI've been doing China, nearly exclusively, for almost 10 years now, and I need to branch out. It's lost it's allure, I don't enjoy it. I want to get into financial consulting, or management consulting or geopolitical analysis, or even journalism, something that is more generalized. I don't have anything against doing something that involves China in some way, but I do not want to do it exclusively anymore. I've been applying for Business Analyst, Financial Consultant, Global Strategy Analyst, Risk Analyst these types of positions, through LinkedIn in the Chicago area for many months now. I haven't had any responses though, can't seem to get through the HR filter. The only interview I had was in October, for an exclusively China focused position in Washington, for $43k a year which I didn't take. I'm not sure where to go from here...",

    "text": "From Aerospace to CS: embedded or simulation? Hi there, I'm at a cross road and gathering infos to help me decide my next move and maybe transition into CS. I would really appreciate your feedback. Thanks! \n\n**Background**\n\n* European, 29 (M)\n* Aerospace engineer (MSc.), speak fluently 4 major EU languages (so this is not a limitation for going to another country).\n* Currently unemployed: Worked as a project engineer for a couple years in a toxic department (there was mobbing to colleagues and other unpleasant stuff from our boss) and the tasks I was doing where actually totally different and shitty than what they promised and what I signed up for, which put me into a career-hole without learning/getting experience that was relevant to my goals. This, objectively speaking, I think could have derailed my career. I left and worked for a start-up a bit more than half a year and then launched my drone start-up, which was looking good but after 1y later is failing due to a couple major reasons and decided on pulling the plug. \n* Been looking for a job for the last couple months without luck. No calls, directly dumping my application. It seems the EU market is not yet recovered from the crisis (or that they don't like me having tried the start-up environment and think I'll quit \"soon\" to a start-up again?) and the US may have Aerospace jobs but I can't work there due to ITAR (visa) requirements not being US citizen. \n\nSo I'm seriously considering getting more into CS and looking at embedded or simulation SW engineering (most of the offered jobs I see are for SW). However, in the past 2 years I've been doing more business/management roles in the start-up world and my hard skills are too rusty to get a job now (which I really need in 1-2 months tops).\n\nIn addition, my last SW engineer role was a 1y internship work (I did the same as the fully-paid employed guy next to me) in an important EU firm doing SW simulation in R&D, but haven't really programmed in the last 5 years now.  \n\nI am trying to get a project manager job now since my current skill-set is best suited for that, and would like to pick up more SW skills & experience and transition into IT project management.\n\n\n**Questions to you**\n\n* How does the embedded market look like now? and the simulation (flight simulation, physical modelling, etc)? How did you get there? (interested in US but also specially in EU)\n* Those that are project/product managers in IT, is it worth getting into? what path did you follow?\n* Any tips & tricks on a strategy for getting a job would be appreciated. \n\n\nPD: just noticed another recent post about embedded. Is something up with it?\n\nEDIT: formatting and content.",

    "text": "Should I stay or should I go? Hey guys,\n\nkind of in a weird situation right now and I figured out I could ask for some input from more experienced developers. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nSo, I live on canada and I graduated as a CS major from a fairly average university a couple of months ago and I managed to get a job as soon as I got out for a european consulting firm that also has offices in canada. When I got hired, the original plan was to work on a small website using new technologies (mostly .Net 4.6/Angular4 stuff, I have been doing web dev for a couple of years but never got the chance to really use newer stuff) in their canadian offices under a senior dev supervision for a slightly under-average salary (around 50k CAD) then moving to their european offices (located somewhere in france) at the end of the summer and starting to work as a consultant for 40k-ish euros a year, which is very decent for a junior dev in that area, and also includes great benefits such as 6 weeks paid time-off.\n\nNow, since I started working here, the senior developer that I mentionned earlier has been giving me extremely positive feedback, and jokingly asked me at least 3 or 4 times if I was really sure that I wanted to move. Well lo and behold, one of the local managers asked me to come meet them in their office this afternoon and told me that based on the senior's recommendation as well as their own observation, the company was willing to offer me an intermediate position on the senior's team here in Canada. Their initial offer for this position is 85k salary (which is extremely high for someone in my position), 5 weeks paid time-off, paid common transportation card, paid training, and the team also has to go to Paris every once in a while, so I would probably get the chance to travel as well. In all honesty, my plan really was to move out of Canada for a few years while it's still super easy, travel around Europe for a while, then come back and figure out where to go from there, but I feel like turning down an offer like that would be kind of foolish on my part. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation before? I am really confused right now and would really appreciate some input.\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "Considering a career in IT Audit, good idea ? Hey everyone !\n\nI’m currently finishing up my studies (Bachelor/Master of commerce, general management at a target European school) and I’m kinda lost… \nI wanted to get some advice from you regarding the profession of IT Auditor at a big4.\nI think I’ve pretty much read all the topics on IT audit on reddit, very informative, but I still don’t know if it’s for me. \nAt first I had always aimed at financial audit or TS/TAS and M&A but now I know that I hate accounting, and I tend to get dizzy looking at DCF models on excel and complex financial statements…\nI understand that the appeal for IT audit is less hours (although not always verified, guess it’s gonna depend on your manager/industry/clients/team/office) and slightly better pay, the downside being less diverse exit opportunities.\n\n But I still can’t get what you do day to day, I realize that for many it’s all about control testing and screenshots but does it actually get better over the years ? Is there any room for project management, or anything interesting? I’ve read a lot of topics where people seem to advise to not get into this field, but I mean a lot of entry level jobs will essentially consist of grunt work, even in consulting and especially in financial audit. Do you actually find something meaningful or something that you enjoy being an IT auditor or do you just go along cursing the day you chose this career ?\nAnother reason I’m considering this career is because I know there is a high demand for IT auditor and I want to move to Canada (currently in France), I know it will be much harder if I choose to go with financial audit or even consulting (probably too much competition)\n\nI could go for consulting, but I feel the field is so vast it’s even harder to get a clear picture of what I would be doing, and in consulting you never really know what you’re in for, so basically it will all depend on what kind of mission you’ll be staffed on, and that will affect the rest of your career as well as your exit opps (so less control in consulting, correct me if I’m wrong) \n\nThanks for reading me !

We are two junior consultants + our sectorial team's partner at 20% + an independent consultant who's worked with our partner at 70% as manager (but doesn't really *supervise* the way a senior consultant or in-house manager might. I have the \"project manager\" role; I have some experience with it, but not in the same context.\n\nMere days after kick-off, our partner goes mysteriously on sick leave (without getting into details, there's some firm politics). So we're a bit aimless at the start. Eventually, another partner is brought in and rights the ship. But unfortunately, many mistakes were made before and after, quite a few made by me through inexperience and hesitating (I'll own up to that). \n\nAlso, as the replacement partner never failed to remind me, my skill in the local language was somewhat lacking. Full disclosure - I am bilingual, but said local language is decidedly my second language, though I'm far from incompetent in it. Some mistakes here and there, and it seemed clear to me that Replacement Partner didn't have the patience to help me out or cover for some of the mistakes I may have made. His tone when I asked for clarifications on his requests made his impatience quite apparent (to me anyway).\n\nMy colleague, for her part, was of the opinion that putting two junior consultants on a mission of that nature (and importance) didn't seem such a wise idea, but our staffing situation made things complicated.\n\nAnyway, I get replaced. \n\nIt sucks - I'm really bummed about it. It's embarrassing (for me), and not a great way to start my career at this firm. In fact, I'm sure such a rough start could have meant they let me go before my trial period is over BUT so far I'm set to be put on another mission (with, of course, higher scrutiny and the expectation I step up).\n\n**So, what do I do, considering the limited training opportunities available and risk that I end up without a dedicated senior resource to guide me and help out (at least at the beginning)?**\n\nFeel free to ask for details on mistakes I made : globally, it was not doing project management right : not keeping up the rhythm and making sure actions were followed up on correctly or promptly. I can't be sure I'll get a similar role in future, of course, but it's good to know I guess...",

I understand the life of a consultant is a grind and very time consuming, so this may be a bit of a different scope than this sub normally handles. \n\nBut as someone about to graduate college, with work experience at one of the largest asset management firms in America and at a European foreign relations think tank/political advising & communications firm, I think I have a pretty decent grip on things like business processes, PR, macro and legislative impact. Some friends are also interested in this with their backgrounds being in accounting and law.\n\nI will be returning to work at that asset manager full time, but I was hoping to do some consulting independently as a secondary source of income. I know, I know, its a huge time drain/takes a lot of energy. Even more of a concern, why wouldn't people just go to a full time firm that can commit teams of people to their problems. \n\nI am not planning on this being any type of primary business venture, just some supplementary income. I would focus on small business clients obviously, but we have been struggling to identify either industries or how to identify specific companies who could benefit from our services. \n\nAny ideas on how to bootstrap a consulting business? Tips?\n\nThanks guys. Again, apologies if this is not exactly within the scope of the sub",

    "text": "\"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters - The religious roots of feminism Excerpt from \"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters \n\n[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Short-Introduction-Margaret-Walters/dp/019280510X)\n\n\n***\n\nSome of the first European women to speak out for themselves, and for their sex, did so within a religious framework, and in religious terms. It is perhaps not always easy, in our secular society, to bring them back to life: to recognize fully their courage, or to understand the implications, or the extent, of their challenge to the status quo.\n\nFor centuries, and all over Europe, there were families who disposed of ‘unnecessary’ or unmarriageable daughters by shutting them away in convents. For some, this must have felt like life imprisonment; but for others, conventual quiet seems to have facilitated genuine fulfilment: it allowed some women to develop a talent for organization, and some were able to read and think, and discover their own distinctive voices. Hildegard of Bingen, who was born at the end of the 11th century and became a nun, and later the abbess, of a small Rhineland convent, has long been known as a remarkable and impressive writer; recently, her great musical talent has been rediscovered and celebrated. But she was sometimes plagued with doubts about her ‘unfeminine’ activities, and wrote to one of the leading churchmen of the time, Bernard of Clairvaux, asking if she – an uneducated woman – should continue with her writing and with composing. He encouraged her, and within a few years she was known and honoured all over Europe. When she was 60 years old, she embarked upon preaching tours all through the German empire, even though at that time only priests were allowed to preach.\n\nLike other medieval women, when seeking to imagine the almost unimaginable, and to communicate her understanding of God’s love, she turned to womanly, and specifically maternal, experience, and wrote of the ‘motherhood’ of God. ‘God showed me his grace again’, she writes, ‘as . . . when a mother offers her weeping child milk.’ Some religious women imagine, with maternal tenderness, the infant Jesus. A Flemish Beguine meditates on what the mother of God must have felt:\n\n>for three or more days [she] held Him close to her so that He nestled between her breasts like a baby . . . sometimes she kissed him as though he were a little child and sometimes she held Him on her lap as if He were a gentle lamb.\n\n‘Just because I am a woman, must I therefore believe that I must not tell you about the goodness of God . . . ?’ asked the Englishwoman Julian of Norwich in the early 15th century. She marveled that ‘he who was her Maker chose to be born of the creature that is made’. Moreover, she argued:\n\n>our Saviour is our true mother in whom we are eternally born and by whom we shall always be enclosed . . . We are redeemed by the motherhood of mercy and grace . . . to the nature of motherhood belong tender love, wisdom and knowledge, and it is good, for although the birth of our body is only low, humble and modest compared with the birth of our soul, yet it is he who does it in the beings by women it was done.\n\nWhereas other women had made the analogy briefly, Julian of Norwich goes on to spell out the comparison very directly. Christ is like\n\n>the kind, loving mother who knows and recognizes the need of her child, and carefully watches over it. The mother can give her child milk to suck, but our dear mother Jesus can feed us with himself, and he does so most generously and most tenderly . . .\n\nMargery Kempe, a contemporary of Julian’s who travelled from her Essex home to visit her, produced an account of her own life – probably dictated to a scribe – that has been described as the first autobiography in English. Her life story reveals, only too clearly, why her self-preoccupation and her melodramatic acting out of her own miseries infuriated so many people who came into contact with her. But her story is also, unexpectedly, a deeply touching one; and more than that, it is impressive simply because she insists on taking herself and her experiences seriously. Margery came up against the painful and terrible aspect of the motherhood that had inspired the celibate Julian. She was miserably ill all through her first pregnancy, and after a prolonged and very painful birth, was left exhausted and depressed: ‘what with the labour she had in childbirthing and the sicknesse going before, she despaired of her life’. At times, she came near to killing herself. She was comforted, she recalls, by a vision of Christ, in the form of a handsome young man sitting at her bedside; he informed her that ‘you may boldly, when you are in bed, take me to you as your wedded husband’. But it was only years later, and after 14 pregnancies, that Margery finally managed to negotiate a deal with her demanding mortal husband: if he stopped insisting on sex, she would pay off his debts, and forgo her strict Friday fast to eat and drink with him. He agreed, though with a hint of sarcasm that echoes nastily across the centuries: ‘May your body be as freely available to God as it has been to me.’\n\nWith remarkable energy and determination, Margery then set out across Europe on a pilgrimage, and though her constant weeping and wailing so infuriated her fellow pilgrims that they abandoned her en route, her courage – and obsessive determination – enabled her to reach Jerusalem, and eventually to get as far as Constantinople.\n\nBy the late 16th century, increasing numbers of women were beginning to argue their case more consistently and more aggressively, though still within a religious framework. The Reformation enabled more women to receive an education. In\n\n1589, in what one historian has called ‘the earliest piece of English feminist polemic’, Jane Anger took up a challenging position by insisting that Eve was superior to Adam: a second, and hence improved, model. Whereas Adam was fashioned from ‘dross and filthy clay’, God made Eve from Adam’s flesh, ‘that she might be purer than he’, which ‘doth evidently show how far we women are more excellent than men . . . From woman sprang man’s salvation. A woman was the first that believed, and a woman likewise the first that repented of sin.’ Anger then descends crossly, and comically, to everyday domestic life. It is women, she reminds us, who make sure that men are fed, clothed, and cleaned: ‘without our care they lie in their beds as dogs in litter, and go like lousy mackerel swimming in the heat of summer’.\n\nBut any woman wanting to defend her sex had to tackle powerfully negative scriptural images of women: Delilah was treacherous, Jezebel murderous, while Eve was directly responsible for the Fall of the human race: ‘the woman tempted him and he did eat’. Saint Paul was regularly invoked against any woman who spoke out, or asked awkward questions about the Church’s attitude to women: ‘Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted to them to speak’, he instructed the Corinthians. And again, in the epistle to Timothy, ‘if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home: for it is shame for women to speak in the church’.\n\nGradually, a few women found the confidence to defy these scriptural prohibitions. Some offered dissenting interpretations of Genesis, arguing that Adam was, after all, as much to blame for the Fall as Eve. So, in 1611, Aemilia Lanyer reminded her readers that Christ\n\n>was begotten of a woman, born of a woman, nourished of a woman, obedient to a woman . . . he healed women, pardoned women, comforted women . . . after his resurrection, appeared first to a woman.\n\nAnd Rachel Speght sardonically remarked in 1617:\n\n>If Adam had not approved that deed which Eve had done, and been willing to tread the steps which she had gone, he being her head would have reproved her, have made the commandment a bit to restrain him from breaking his master’s position.\n\nOthers insisted that God had signalled his forgiveness by making Mary, a descendant of Eve, the mother of Christ.\n\nIn the course of the troubled 17th century, particularly among the sects, the many and various small groups that rejected the established Church in favour of purer forms of worship, women found more freedom. Some, at least, felt inspired to preach or to prophesy. Modern historians have pointed out the important role of women among the religious separatists who fled persecution in late Elizabethan England by emigrating to America or to Holland, as well as their activity as preachers. Women were active, too, among the small dissenting groups that managed to survive underground in England, until, during the Civil War and\n\nInterregnum, they emerged dramatically and vocally. Keith Thomas lists some of these independent congregations: Brownists, Independents, Baptists, Millenarians, Familists, Quakers, Seekers, Ranters. Whatever their theological differences, they all believed the necessity for spiritual regeneration in every individual. The experiencing of what Quakers called the ‘Inner Light’ was more important than external observance – and that light knows no sexual distinction. As one contemporary writer claimed, ‘one faithful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and effectually loose and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the ministers in the world’.\n\nVarious independent congregations had, for some time, been allowing women to debate publicly and to vote on matters of  Church business; by the 1640s some, particularly among the Quakers, were going further. In 1659, the Quaker Fox argued that ‘Christ is in the male as in the female, who redeems from under the Law . . . Christ in the male and female, who are in the spirit of God, are not under the Law.’\n\n‘Might not the spirit of Christ, that is begotten of God in the female as well as the male . . . speak?’ asked Katherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. Increasingly often, women felt moved, divinely inspired, to speak in meetings and even at service, though they were often greeted with bitter opposition. They were criticized for being ‘puffed up with pride’ and ‘vainglorious arrogance’, and even worse, for ‘usurping authority over men’. In 1646, for example, John Vicars complained bitterly about ‘bold impudent housewives . . . without all womanly modesty who take upon them . . . to prate . . . most directly contrary to the apostle’s inhibition’.\n\nJohn Bunyan was totally opposed to this active participation by women, arguing that Satan, inevitably, tempts the weaker Eve, rather than Adam: ‘the man was made the head in worship, and the keeper of the garden of God’. He referred to women as ‘that simple and weak sex’. Citing the first epistle to the Corinthians, he argued that women are ‘not the image and glory of God as the men are. They are placed beneath.’ He disapproved of separate women’s meetings, which did nothing but encourage ‘unruliness’. ‘I do not believe they [women] should minister to God in prayer before the whole church,’ he insisted, adding sarcastically, ‘for then I should be a Ranter or a Quaker.’ In any public gathering, ‘her part is to hold her tongue, to learn in silence’\n\nEven in the 1670s, that courageous Quaker Margaret Fell still felt the need to defend women’s independence of conscience, and their right to play an active part in worship. In a tract called Women’s Speaking Justified, she argued emphatically: ‘Those that speak against . . . the spirit of the Lord speaking in a woman, simply by reason of her sex . . . speak against Christ and his Church, and are of the Seed of the Serpent.’\n\nThe prophet Joel was sometimes cited as an answer to Saint Paul’s prohibition spirit upon all flesh:\n\n> . . . and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.\n\nJoel’s ecstatic vision seemed, to many, particularly relevant during the great upheavals caused by the Civil War and the Interregnum; there was a widespread feeling that apocalypse was, indeed, imminent. The sect who styled themselves Fifth Monarchists, for example, believed that the world’s four great secular empires – Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome – having passed away, the fifth – Christ’s Kingdom and the rule of the saints – was close at hand. In this feverish and volatile climate, prophets, many with revolutionary ideas, flourished.\n\nIn this area, a woman’s supposed passivity, her receptivity to outside influence, could, ironically, be claimed as an advantage: she might prove more receptive, more open, to becoming a channel for the voice of God. The Belgian prophet Antonia Bourigue, who was widely read in England, produced a disconcerting and double-edged justification: ‘they ought to let God speak by a woman, if it be His Pleasure, since he spoke in former times to a Prophet by a Beast’.\n\nBut the line between prophetic inspiration and lunacy, between possession by God and by the devil, was a narrow one. In 17th-century England, women were still being tried for witchcraft. Moreover, female prophets could easily be dismissed as merely crazy. Lady Eleanor Davis, for example, had been claiming divine inspiration for years; early one morning in 1625, she heard ‘a Voice from Heaven, speaking as through a trumpet these words, There is nineteen years and a half to the Judgement Day’. She went on to publish tracts that were interpreted as predicting, amongst other things, the death of Charles I. Her husband burned her books; and she was often the butt of jokes. An anagram of her name – Dame Eleanor Davis: Never so mad a ladie – was gleefully circulated. But her visionary fervour put her at real risk; even her rank could not protect her from charges of treachery. In 1633, after being charged before the High Commission that ‘she took upon her (which much unbeseemed her sex) not only to interpret the Scriptures . . . but also to be a prophetess’, she was fined and imprisoned in Bedlam. But she came into her own during the Interregnum, when many of her prophecies seemed to have been realized. She went on to publish at least 37 tracts between 1641 and her death 11 years later.\n\nAnother prophetess, Anna Trapnel, experienced some kind of revelation at a Baptist church in London. By 1652, she had joined the Fifth Monarchists, and in 1654, she accompanied a male preacher to Whitehall, where she fell into a trance that lasted for 12 days. Crowds gathered to hear her prophecies – and her harsh criticisms of Oliver Cromwell and his government – which were recorded in Strange and Wonderful News from Whitehall and The Cry of a Stone. She insisted – in verse – that God’s message was addressed to women as well as men:\n\n>John though wilt not offended beThat handmaids here should sing, That they should meddle to declare The matters of the King . . . .\n\nThe authorities labelled her as mad, but still brought her to trial. ‘The report was that I would discover myself to be a witch when I came before the justices, by having never a word to answer for myself’, she said. But her sheer volubility defeated the court, and she continued, undeterred, with her prophecies. Cromwell’s government undoubtedly took this kind of prediction seriously; several times, he and his council were interrupted by, and seriously listened to, prophets, several of whom were women.\n\nThe appeal to divine inspiration was probably of limited value as a means of female emancipation; the feminism of the future would depend less on the assertion of women’s spiritual equality and more on natural rights, and a denial that there is any intellectual difference between the sexes.\n\nBut there were political implications to this outburst of religious fervour. In the 16th century, the Anabaptists had recognized women as equal to men, and allowed them to pray and speak in meetings. Women from the congregations who styled themselves Levellers seem to have been particularly active on a larger stage, and showed considerable political shrewdness. The sect encouraged women’s activity, believing in the equality of all ‘made in the image of God’. In the 1640s and early 1650s, when many of their husbands were in prison, Leveller women repeatedly turned up en masse at\n\nWestminster – staging what sounds very like contemporary ‘demonstrations’ – to demand freedom for their husbands, but also to complain bitterly about their own, consequent hardships. They were usually treated harshly, and rebuked for meddling in things beyond their understanding. The crowds of women who petitioned for peace in 1642 and 1643 were dismissed contemptuously as ‘Whores, Bawds, Oyster women, Kitchen maids’. Three hundred women, who presented another petition to the House of Lords, were rejected out of hand by the Duke of Lennox. ‘Away with these women,’ he exclaimed, adding, with a jeer, ‘we were best have a Parliament of women.’ In May 1649 yet another petition for the release of the Leveller prisoners was turned away sarcastically: ‘It was not for women to Petition, they might stay at home and wash the dishes.’ To which the women, unabashed, retorted, ‘we have scarcely any dishes left us to wash’.\n\nLater in that year, they tried again. As many as ten thousand women signed yet another petition, asking:\n\n>We cannot but wonder and grieve that we should appear so despicable in your eyes as to be thought unworthy to petition to represent our grievances to this honourable House. Have we not an equal interest with the men of this nation in those liberties and securities contained in the Petition of Right, and other good laws of the land? Are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us, no more than from men, but by due process of law . . .\n\nA thousand women carried it to the House with sea-green ribbons pinned to their breasts. Once again, they were dismissed scornfully.\n\nBut among the Quakers, particularly, women found the chance to develop their skills as administrators. Regular women’s meetings were set up alongside the men’s meetings in the 1650s; and though, from the beginning, women seem to have concentrated on traditionally feminine areas, such as welfare and moral problems, they had the chance to develop their own, very effective organization, which in fact handled considerable sums of money. However, historians have suggested that there was a gradual reduction in the scope of their concerns; by the 1680s, they were confining themselves to ‘womanly’ matters. In these later years, they concentrated on ‘such things as are proper to us, as the poor more especially and the destitute amongst us’. These included helping young men to find apprenticeships or work, and instructing younger women ‘to all wholesome things’, which included looking after their husbands, children, and homes, and always behaving in a manner that was ‘discreet, chaste, and sober’.\n\n***\n\nImage from the chapter: http://i.imgur.com/16cTngI.png\n\n*\"The scene is viewed with a hint of satire – though is it directed at the earnest speaker or at the inattentive audience?

    "text": "I'm getting into a soon-to-be startup. I'm worried about several things and I thought that you might be able to help me in figuring out what I should do. Hello r/jobs, \n\n\n\nBefore getting started, I need to point out two things : I am not a native speaker so I apologize in advance for the typos I'm going to make and if you could highlight them it would be very kind of you. The second thing is that I don't know if my partners are on Reddit so I won't be really precise about what we will be working on.\n\n\n\nThat being said, here we go. I[20/M] am a first year european art student and a couple months ago I met a man at a seminar in a prestigious engineering school. We'll call him Tom. Tom is a PhD student, he is about to finish his paper in a few weeks. His thesis, and his work, are related to a new kind of musical instrument. He has been working on it for three years and a half and is now looking into creating a startup. He is currently looking for money and for partners to work with him.\n\nI'm one of the partners he found. But I'm definitely the least experienced one. The others are another PhD student (in a world class engineering school) who will be working on marketing and help in engineering and the last one is a designer/art gallery director.\nHe has also found money. Some big players believe in the projects and wants to finance it up to 200k€. The final product will be sold between 5k and 10k€.\n\n\n\nI have two concerns. First, I have the impression that Tom is overestimating my skills. My task is going to be a lot of programming (I knew what I was getting into though, I know some stuffs in programming but this is clearly next level for me. On a scale from 1 to 10, I would be a 4 or maybe a 5 in programming skills) to design the UX/visual feedback of the instrument. I don't know if I will be able to meet his demands, since the final product needs to look perfectly clean and professional. \n\nThe other concern is about a totally different thing... *Why me ?* I mean, I get along with him very well, we have the same centers of interest (sound, programming and art) but there is an enormous gap between my experience and his. Tom \"hired\" me before even getting to know me. At the end of the seminar I was practically in the team already. At the beginning, I think it was because we could get a scholarship with the partnership our schools have, but it didn't work out very well and as I said, he has found money elsewhere. Today, the both of us have been working on a brainstorming and it was really great. He genuinely seems to be a good guy but I can't stop wondering why he chose me instead of a more experienced guy. \n\nI saw *Jobs* (the movie) the other day, and maybe I'm overreacting but I feel like this could be about money. Since I'm younger and less experienced, would it be a reason to scam me (the word scam sounds a bit strong but I don't know any other word which could do it) ? If you don't know the story, when he got rich, Steve Jobs didn't give any money to a teenager (and others) who was helping them out at the beginning, because he was \"just a kid\". Yes I know, I'm definitely thinking about this too much.\n\n\n\nTo be honest, I find this project really cool and interesting. It could really become the next big thing in the world of music and I'm proud to be a part of this adventure - it might not feel that way when you're reading me, but I'm still down to earth and I know it could fail/end at any time - . But I don't know if I'll meet everybody's expectations and it bothers quite a bit. Should I be careful about something ? Share my thoughts with Tom ? Any opinion or advice will be appreciated.\n\n\n\nTL;DR : I'm a first year student getting into a startup with people a lot more experienced. Don't know what to think about this.\n\nEDIT : A typo, and several phrasings.",

    "text": "how do i continue after my first job situation? Hi Guys \n\nHere is a story about first “real” job after having finished my university degree within finance and management. \n\nPlease comment and ask some critical questions to help me reflect on the situation I got into. \n\nAlso I would like to know how to sell myself in the future. \n\nMy entry to the company\n\nIn August 2016 I started to work in a larger European diary company and started in the Scandinavian headquarter in Stockholm that is responsible for the product milk. Julius and Romeo hired me as an intern. Julius is the CEO of the business unit and is a very confident man with a MBA from Harvard. In his unit he had Romeo to lead the project department, this for example entails to take ideas and make them market ready. \n\nA year ago, Romeo received the assignment to make one idea market ready and he hired me as an intern so support him in the process. In the beginning of my entry I felt very excited because Romeo enabled me to being an entrepreneur in larger conglomerate. He had an endless backlog of tasks and I received the mandate to solve them solely. By that I mean tasks such as developing a go-2-market strategy, developing product requirements, developing the value proposition and doing pricing. \n\nAlso the supervision was extremely well organized. In the beginning Romeo and I had brief but very frequent talks in order to align. This was very helpful because we both needed to build trust. After a month or two I was so deep in the project that I did not require so much supervision anymore so Romeo trusted me to drive the business development of the product. Through Romeo I received great reputation in the business unit and Julius also started to give me some lightweight tasks that I mastered. \n\nMy internship however was limited to a specific time period. Romeo and I had few good talks about my future, and he hoped that I would continue in the company. \n\nAs such I was not reluctant to stay in the company as I had a great time and enjoyed the both Julius and Romeo as they were excellent boss’s. However I wanted to move to Copenhagen to go back to my friends and girlfriend. \n\nLuckily we had an operational site in Copenhagen, both Julius and Romeo talked with the local director in Copenhagen and they gave me the opportunity to start in Copenhagen.\n\nThe transfer to Copenhagen\n\nIn February 2017 Niklas the local director hired me.  I received the task to continue on the business development of the product that worked on in Stockholm and to work on some corporate development tasks. That meant that I closely with the sales department looked into sales targets and strategic partners. Together with one sales manager we created meetings with top clients and interesting partners for the product. \n\nHaving talked to Romeo, he was very excited. He loved that the Danish operational site created a good outlook for his project. \nFurthermore, I started to work on the corporate development project. I have a finance degree that means I had the theory in place however I looked for some guidance from Niklas to get start this project.  \n\nHowever a few months after I started Niklas started to neglect giving me the guidance and whenever he looked over it I received bad feedback. I checked with other financial analysts in the company and they actually liked my work. Additionally Niklas blocked any further development on the business development of the product even though Romeo and Julius loved the progress. \n\n8 months after I started at the Danish operational site I got fired due to mismatch between me and Niklas. I learned a few days afterwards that Romeo and Niklas hate each other and feels that I have been in the middle of a political battleground.",

    "text": "Career Advancement Advice: leaving current employer after 2 years? Hello Everyone,\n\nI’m looking for a bit of input, perhaps those with a few more years professional experience can draw from their time in the work force and offer a bit of insight. First some background: ~6 years ago I’d broken into my industry as a sales associate. Having experienced a fair amount of success, advanced in ~3 years time to the manager level at a second employer, where I have been for the last 2+ years.\n\nFast forward to today; I’ve received an offer to join a multinational generic pharmaceutical manufacturer at the Associate Director level, with a fairly substantial bump in pay. \n\nI’m weighing the pros and cons of leaving my current employer, a European based manufacturer, a brilliant group of scientists/engineers/support staff, and joining a new company. In terms of career progression and future earnings potential, I believe this is the right move. Looking ahead, it is likely that I return to school for an MBA, and believe the progression will show well in the application process as well.\n\nI certainly know what I’d like to hear from the group … but I’m open to hearing other opinions, especially any which are dissenting. Implications of moving from one company to another in a relatively short period of time? Am I right to assume this is a symptom of today's job market? Is the clear jump in pay, responsibility and title justification enough?

I have worked with similar software in the past from multiple other vendors which are vastly superior. I work directly with a client director with whom we have an excellent working relationship. I find myself in a dilemma: on one hand, as an advisor to my client, i should advise against our own software; on the other, i should be promoting the interests of my firm or at least not harming them?\n\nI feel the right thing to do would be to advise against.\n\nP.S.: In reality, I will not say anything. THis is a hypothetical thought experiment. Thank you.",

Apparently there was at least one other example:\n\n[The Mochica](https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/geekquinox/unearthed-peruvian-tomb-confirms-women-ruled-over-brutal-160013738.html?ref=gs)\n\n>This find makes it clear that women didn't just run rituals in this area but governed here and were queens of Mochica society,\" said project director Luis Jaime Castillo, according to the Associated Free Press.\n\n>\"It is the eighth priestess to be discovered,\" he added. \"Our excavations have only turned up tombs with women, never men.\"\n\nMen were apparently forced into ritual combat where the losing side was sacrificed.  \n\nThere was a fad in the 70s and 80's started by figures like Riane Einsler (\"The Chalice and the Blade\") suggesting that if women ran society we would live in peaceful utopias.   The ideology is discussed in [\"Sanctifying Misandry\"](http://www.mqup.ca/sanctifying-misandry-products-9780773538733.php) by Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young:\n\n\"To set the stage, the authors discuss two massively popular books - Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade - both of which rely on a feminist conspiracy theory of history. They then show how some goddess feminists and their academic supporters have turned what Christians know as the Fall of Man into the fall of men. In the beginning, according to three \"documentary\" films, our ancestors lived in an egalitarian paradise under the aegis of a benevolent great goddess. But men either rebelled or invaded, replacing the goddess with gods and establishing patriarchies that have oppressed women ever since. In the end, however, women will restore the goddess and therefore paradise as well. The book concludes with several case studies of modern goddess religion and its effects on mainstream religion.\"\n\nVariations of this theme can still be seen today in gender studies departments.  In Sweden they are even pushing for a \"feminist foreign policy\" that would stress diplomacy over war.   Apparently these ladies are unaware of the fact that [Queens initiated more wars than Kings](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/european-queens-waged-more-wars-than-kings.html).  Or that men evolved [better making up skills](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).  \n\nAnother feminist myth bites the dust.",

    "text": "A reflection on two recent interactions with other women Apologies in advance for the length of this post, but two recent interactions have left me with a rather sour taste in my mouth. I've been mulling them over and decided to post here to share and hopefully inspire some thoughtful discussion about modern-day feminism and specifically, how women treat other women.\n\n\nThe first interaction happened in a grocery store as my partner and I were shopping in preparation for a camping trip. I had just picked up two of those single-serving instant flavored oatmeal cups. An older woman and her husband passed us in the aisle, and she asked me how much those cups cost. I told her $2.00 each. She looked surprised, then even somewhat offended, and remarked that for the price of those two I could get a whole large container of Quaker's oatmeal. I laughed it off and said, \"I guess so,\" since I neither felt the need to explain to her my preference of oatmeal nor to justify my financial decisions. She then proceeded to turn to my boyfriend, scowled, and said, \"And you're going to marry her?\", her words dripping with judgment. While both my boyfriend and I were too stunned to reply, she huffed off and disappeared to the next aisle. \n\n\nI was honestly so taken aback by the whole interaction that I couldn't even begin to put into words what about it disturbed me the most. Was it the way she spoke to me, so condescending and superior? Was it the way she judged my worth as a woman by how financially sound my shopping decisions were? Was it the fact that she, a stranger, knew nothing of my circumstances and yet felt the need to intrude with her opinion (about the most mundane of topics - *oatmeal* - no less)? Was it how she insinuated that I was not marriage material (or even that marriage was my goal) because of my choice of dried goods? Was it the way the question was purposefully directed at my boyfriend, to put him on the spot and plant doubt into his mind as to my ability to take on the role of wife and keeper of household? Or was it the knowledge that, had I been a man, she never would have even cared what kind of oatmeal I bought? \n\n\nWhat bothered me was all of the above. And it pissed me off to no small extent. I realize that this woman was raised in another time, when women took home ec classes and the role of wife and then mother were perhaps the most important and defining things about a woman. She was  (and this is giving her the benefit of the doubt) not trying to be a bitch, but rather just a product of the society that shaped her. So maybe age was her excuse.\n\n\nWhich brings me to the next encounter at IHOP. I'm sure most Americans have been, but for the uninitiated, IHOP is one of those restaurants where you eat and then pay up front. My boyfriend and I went up to the hostess, a young woman in her early 20s, to pay our bill. I asked if it wouldn't be too much of a hassle for her to split the tab. She plucked my boyfriend's credit card from his hand and told me, \"Girl, why do you want to pay? He's the man; let him pay.\" I calmly told her that I would prefer to pay for half and waited patiently until she took my card as well. She shook her head at me and said, \"Paying is his job, girl. You let him go broke.\" \n\n\nSo apparently, it offends some people's very existence that I don't take advantage of my sex and have men pay for my meal. Let me repeat that. *It offends some people when a woman pays for her own meal.* The problem with the hostess's mindset is that she's the type that wants to be an \"independent woman\" but also wants to be financially spoiled by her man, which not only makes things very confusing for the opposite sex but also basically relinquishes her right to be treated equally and fairly by the very nature of the request. \n\n\nThe forces against feminism take many forms, not least of which are other women. The days of blatant sexism in daily interaction have in large part been replaced by smaller, often unnoticed aggressions -- perhaps a judging glance, a snide remark, or an ignorant question. To clarify, most of the time there is no malice, but just a general thoughtlessness with respect to treating women as equals to men. And women are often as guilty of perpetuating these as men are.",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago.

    "text": "I've lived in Iran and in the U.S. Anti-feminists on both sides mirror (and feed off of) each other. Warning: Long post.\n\nI grew up in Iran but moved to the U.S. about a decade ago. You can say I've seen \"both sides of the coin\" as far as societal attitudes towards feminism is concerned. Here are some of my observations:\n\n* Here in the U.S. you often see people admonishing feminists for focusing on \"first-world problems,\" while women in developing countries are grappling with much more serious issues. \n\n\n    You might be surprised to know that a very similar argument is used against women's rights activists in Iran, not necessarily by the state, but by conservatives at large. Iranian feminists are told that their focus on the mandatory dress-code (including hijab), on [the right to ride bicycles in public](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-37430493), or on [the right to enter sports stadiums](https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/30/banned-stadiums-being-woman-iran) is frivolous. \"What's the big deal about wearing a scarf on your head?\" \"Are you so defined by your attire that a piece of cloth is going to oppress you?\" \"You are diverting attention from real issues by focusing on getting women to stadiums.\" \"Not everyone can afford a bicycle. This is merely a middle-class issue.\"\n\n\n    Iranian women are also told they should be thankful to live in a state that keeps them safe from ISIS, because things could be a lot worse. Sound familiar?  \n\n* Statistics around issues like the wage gap, rape, and male-on-female violence have been contested over and over again in the U.S. They are called bogus, misrepresentative, and at best inconclusive. Meanwhile, statistics on mortality, longevity and well-being are used to show that American women have it better than men. \n\n\n    You'd think anti-feminists couldn't use the same argument in Iran, but they do. Longevity is similarly female-skewed in Iran ([and in most countries of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy#List_by_the_OECD_.282013.29)). So we're often asked: \"how come you live longer if you're so oppressed?\" These anti-feminists point out that [Iranian women have a higher penetration in STEM fields than American women](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyguttman/2015/12/09/set-to-take-over-tech-70-of-irans-science-and-engineering-students-are-women/#7b9d107e44de). That Iranian women are not subject to compulsory national service, as opposed to some developed countries such as Norway. That Iranian women are [less likely to have body-image issues](http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/09/15/347083281/covering-up-with-the-hijab-may-aid-womens-body-image). In a way, we're told that we have it better than some Western women in some aspects, so we should stop being greedy about pursuing other aspects. Sound familiar? \n \n* Iran's theocratic regime has often argued that women have a natural tendency to nurture, and therefore need to stay home and take care of their children. Recently, they've discovered the fields of evolutionary/developmental psychology/biology and try to argue this point from a \"scientific\" perspective ([non-English link 1](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iILWu2n5hOEJ:www.tebyan-zn.ir/News-Article/zanan/2010/10/10/5607.html+&cd=12&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us), [non-English link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mi0JZm_2vbc)). [Sound familiar](https://twitter.com/charlesmurray/status/837287933312909313)?\n\n* In the U.S., some people argue that family courts unfairly favor women, especially in issues related to custody and child support. You might be surprised to hear that there are similar arguments in Iran, not around custody (which almost always favors the father), but around [Mahr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahr). Anti-feminists have vehemently opposed and dismissed the mandatory Mahr payout as a law that disadvantages men, conveniently forgetting that the scale is tipped the other way in almost any other legal issue. \n \n* The red-piller ideology has also found its following in Iran (and other countries I imagine). I've seen an increasing number of my old college mates and friends turn to red-pill/mgtow-type communities, especially on reddit. They even have a prophet (Roosh-V, who was born to Iranian parents). You might wonder, what makes them think they're disadvantaged and oppressed by feminists, despite living in country where a woman is literally worth half a men ([+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#3), [+](http://iranhrdc.org/english/publications/legal-commentary/1000000261-gender-inequality-and-discrimination-the-case-of-iranian-women.html#22))? Is the illusion of victimhood so pervasive that it can elude some of the most gender-privileged people on the planet?  \n\n* The Islamic Republic has repeatedly accused women's rights activists of being Western stooges, for defending Iranian women's right to dress as they choose. Feminists in the West are repeatedly called terrorist sympathizers for defending Muslim women's right to dress as they choose. Both arguments twist the reality and turn a very simple issue (the right to choose your attire) into a tool for geo-political conflict. \n\nI expect some of you to say: but anti-feminists in the U.S. *do* have more convincing points, seeing that their country doesn't deprive women of their most basic rights. The ridiculous rhetoric of anti-feminists in Iran doesn't undermine the fair points raised by anti-feminists in the U.S.\n\nWell I do agree that objectively and definitively, Iranian law is far\nmore backwards in terms of gender equality. But there are three points to keep in mind:\n\n1. U.S. law didn't use to be very progressive either. Progressive ideas had to be argued into the law, by people who fought for them. The law often doesn't change as long as public opinion around it doesn't start to change. In that sense, anti-feminist rhetoric in the U.S. is not as innocuous as it's made out to be. I'm sure 100 years ago when women did not have the right to vote, most people were able to rationalize it as a necessary disadvantage for women, similar to how denying women a decent maternity leave is rationalized now. \n\n2. It's always easier to judge a nation from the outside. But when you live inside a country, you are exposed to the nuances and complexities of social issues, and might lose sight of the big picture. For instance, a Swedish citizen might view the U.S. as remarkably backwards in terms of gender equality, when it comes to access to abortion and affordable healthcare, violence against women, representation in politics, etc. But to some people living in the U.S. the issue is not \"so black and white\" (to use a phrase so cherished by anti-feminists). Iranian anti-feminists use the same argument (\"it's not as black and white as the West would like to portray\") to justify their incredibly backwards ideas. Sometimes it's good to take a step back to look at the big picture. \n\n3. The Iranian regime has learned to play the Westerners' rhetorical game really well. For instance: studies [have shown](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/mar/18/secondary-schools-girls-gcse-results) that girls perform better if they study in gender-segregated schools. The Iranian regime has flaunted these statistics in defending its segregation policies, *as if they segregated schools to help girls succeed.* This type of hypocrisy can be illuminating when inequality (in any context) is discussed: **It's not enough when things work out. Things have to work out** ***for the right reasons.***\n\nIn conclusion, I think it's important to look at the global context when issues of women's rights are concerned, and it's also important to see beyond the rhetoric.",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "Hijab and Black Lives Matter: white in-laws pissed... advice? Long time lurker on this sub. Not sure if this is the best place for this, but I've seen other posts with great advice from this sub and you guys have already been very helpful. Black Lives Matter and wearing a hijab are two issues affecting women across the country, and the big women's march on Washington (and across the world!!) was SO INSPIRING. As a young woman, these issues and many more are affecting me every day. I have a daughter, and I want to be part of the movement that makes the future BETTER for the next generation to come. \n\n----\n\nI just moved in with my white, Italian-American in-laws who think of themselves as totally-not-racist individuals. (Spoiler alert, they are racists.) \n\n\nThey are Trump supporters, support the Mexican wall, support the travel ban aka Muslim ban, and more. But this isn't about \"politics\" this is about morality. I am not a democrat. They often vote democrat. We are not pushing political party agendas here. When you inquire further- and don't let them get away with vague phrases but push for them to say what they really mean- they can say some real doozies. Like that \"white people/culture is inherently better.\" Or that they \"don't want to help those in need if it takes away from our own kind.\" Although they'd never word it that way by their own choice, they admit these thoughts when backed into a corner. And yes they did use those exact words when you make them face it. \n\n\nI'm much more progressive and liberal, myself. (Surprise!) But they ARE open to having some passionate debates with me. They think I'm smart, thoughtful and kind and will occasionally concede their point to me. We've been going at it since the inauguration, right around the time I moved in. They secretly love the arguing and so do I, but I'm still deeply concerned. \n\n\nWhen we discuss these issues, I genuinely hope to bring new information to the table to change their minds and sometimes I do. (Yay!) We all can influence our social circles no matter how big or small the impact may be. \n\n\nAnyway. Today I got a Black Lives Matter t-shirt in the mail. I needed an oversized t-shirt to wear with my new leggings, and I knew this would be a conversation starter. I often wear t-shirts about my beliefs (like \"some chicks marry chicks\" which they have no issue with.) First thing out of their mouths before I even tried it on were: \"Why would you wear this, you're a white girl. You're not even dating a black guy.\" And of course, \"All lives matter.\" \n\n\nWe discussed it at length today and I told them tomorrow I am going to wear this shirt at dinner (I'm making dinner that night), and ALSO a hijab. (There is an invitation for people to try the hijab for a day in solidarity with acceptance of other cultures, although, I still will criticize religion and oppression don't get me wrong, but this is about tolerance.)\n\nThey are so upset. Don't worry, they also love it. We are very respectful on both sides. Like I said, on a certain level they enjoy being challenged. I'm not in any danger, and I won't lose my home or anything like that. But they did say that they wouldn't eat dinner at the same table as me if I wore either item. My plan is to let them sit while I stand in the kitchen, however, I know they will invite me to join as well and then they will stay too. At least, I think they still will, we are just going to get into some heavy (good) conversation. I hope I can encourage them to open their world view. \n\n\n**So, this is why I need your help... can you please help \"prep\" me for some common questions/rebuttals etc. about BLM, and \"anything related to a hijab\" which could honestly be anything from left field considering they aren't super informed on these issues despite having their strong opinions.**\n\n\n(Another example, TRIGGER WARNING RAPE, my mother in law was on a jury back in the day for an alleged rape, and the jury --and judge!-- forced the alleged victim to remove her hijab to testify so they could \"better tell if she's lying\".) \n\n\nI have a decent grasp on the basics, but I want to bolster my \"ammunition\" of statistics, articles sources, examples, memes, etc. They have this idea that the black community, and pretty much any minority, hasn't contributed anything as a whole \"like us whites.\" They say, \"how come on the news it's always blacks and immigrants committing crimes and killing one another.\" \n\n\nTHE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES AS RACIST IS THE MOST DANGEROUS, CONCERNING PART TO ME.\n\n\nThank you in advance, fellow women. And men. And non binary folks. You all rock my world. \n\n\n**Tl;dr: Please help me handle black lives matter and racist issues in general tomorrow at dinner with my in laws. Thank you!**",

    "text": "Why I Teach History (7th grade) I’m pretty routinely asked why I bother teaching.  Specifically, people almost always ask why I chose to teach Middle School History.  After all, it is in the past and the kids don’t really care any way.  To try and get to the bottom of that question, I gave an alternative prompt on our most recent large test.  It was inspired but stories from a long-time family friend’s favorite teacher.  The kids, if they wanted to, could write about “What they learned in 7th Grade World History.”  This isn’t supposed to be a humblebrag or back-patting session.  I was just so amazed by what some of my students wrote that I want to share it with all of you.  This is why teachers teach.\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who has been quiet all year.**\n\n\n   I learned a lot more in 7th grade history than just numbers and dates.  I learned how to think deeper about things, I learned more about why you shouldn’t judge someone by their race, and I learned that history happens all the time.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I learned to think deeper.  In the past, I never really thought about the meaning of some of the holidays or why history matters, but now I know that they actually have an important meaning.  I’ve also been way more interested in history.  I want to know about everything, especially when my parents are talking about stuff.\n\n\n   I learned a lot more about why people shouldn’t judge others by the color of their skin.  I learned that it is about more than because its racist and wrong, its also because were all equal.  No one is superior.  Some may think the Europeans are better and smarter than the Meso-Americans but that’s not true because the Meso-Americans also have amazing buildings and creations, such as temples and floating gardens.\n\n\n   History happens all the time.  I used to think that history was just people that changed the world but history also happens in my own life. History is being made everyday, even when we don’t know that it is.  There are also different types of history, such as personal history, world history, and even Internet history.  We probably see a piece of history everyday and we don’t even know it.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I’ve learned that you should think deeper, don’t judge people by their looks, and history is being made everyday.  History is importance because it teaches us what to do and what not do do.  It shows up past mistakes so we know to not repeat them.  Therefore, I have a lot more in 7th grade history than just dates\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who now comes during break to talk about history.**\n\n7th grade World History was one of the most importance experiences of my life.  This class taught me many things that I will remember forever.  It taught me how working hard has it’s benefits, how you should always think about things more carefully, and most importantly, it taught me one of the most important concepts that everyone should learn.\n\nIn this class, the teacher would always push us to do better and always made sure we were doing our best work.  At the beginning of the school year, I found this annoying because I didn’t think I would benefit from it.  I just thought the teacher was too strict about the quality of work.  Now I realize the benefits of this.  It will help me throughout the rest of my life because most things in life, especially when you get a job, need you to do your best and work your hardest to be successful.\n\nThe teacher also taught me the importance of thinking carefully about things.  He taught me this by tricking our classes to see if we would notice he was lying.  Almost every time I fell for his tricks and this taught me to think more closely about things.  Thinking more closely about things will help my everyday life just like always working my hardest will.\n\nLastly, this class taught me about why we care about African civilizations.  This was an important lesson because it showed me how biased our opinions of West African cultures are because they are influenced by European ideas.  This concept will help me educate others on this topic because many do not realize this.  It is the most important thing that I have learned so far in my school career.  Many others need to learn this too.\n\nThis year in 7th grade was very important to me.  It taught me so many important lessons that I will remember forever.  It taught me the importance of thinking closely and working my hardest.  It also taught me about why our opinions on the African cultures are biased and the importance of learning and teaching their true story.  This class will help me in so many ways for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – An Anonymous student that sent 10-20 emails to me over the last two quarters, trying to solve the question of “Why we care?” with no points involved.**\n\n\n\nLearning of the Meso-American and African societies is part of the seventh grade standards, but it is often not told the way it really happened.  The takeover and destruction of these civilizations probes the importance of history and the complexity of people and their actions in history.  The reasons the horrendous actions of the Europeans are still accepted are guilt and faulty reasoning, the lack of purely good and bad people, and bias/lack of enthusiasm in history today.  The repetition of these issues in other situations, even slightly, happens over and over in history and the modern day.\n\n\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived and encountered Meso American or African civilizations, they were quick to declare superiority.  Their first reaction to the confusion of the other people was to assume that they were stupid and had no culture.  When it became apparent that they could use these people to their own advantage, they decided that the best way to relieve the guilt was to make the non-Europeans inhuman.  This creates the illusion that killing and enslaving people was much less cruel than it should be, as they were not people at all.  This idea is used over and over again by thousands of people.  Essentially making the victims of evil actions into people who shouldn’t be seen as victims, thus the actions are no longer evil.  It is seen in history and it is seen now, and being aware of it gives one the ability to properly understand the actions of others.\n\n\n\nThat being said, most who cover up what they are doing do not think they need to cover it up.  Most people legitimately believe that what they are doing is for the greater good, including the Europeans when doing their pillaging.  King Leopold infamously believed that what he was doing benefited the Africans.  It goes to show that humans are never purposely trying to be bad.  Even if they are aware of their cruel actions, they believe that their reasons are good and that what they are doing is just.  There is no such thing as a purely good or purely evil person.\n\n\n\nThe true story of the enslavement and slaughter of the Meso-Americans and the West Africans is often quieted or ignored for the same reasons as displayed above: guilt, excuses, and the honest belief that what the Europeans did was okay.  Without seeing every side of this incredibly complex story, one would be just as ignorant as the Europeans.  It is important to try as hard as possible to become unbiased and open-minded.  This sentiment applies to everything in life.  Surrounding oneself with diverse opinions and views of the world is the fastest way to eliminate ignorance.  One can’t just listen to whoever’s voice is the loudest.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we care about the Meso-American and African civilizations is complex on its own, but it connects to outside issues and the entirety of human nature.  It teaches one how to be an intelligent, less biased member of our society and most significantly, how important history is to achieve this.",

    "text": "[Indiana] [ELA - student teacher] - Possible ELL resource? Hey guys,\n\nSo I'm about to start my student teaching in the spring and I have a question about a possible resource I found that may help ELLs.\n\nI found a language learning website called www.italki.com and it's designed to help people learn languages from native speakers. The reason I think this website could be helpful is because it would allow students to get practice with English without feeling like they're being graded or judged. Also, it's a place that would allow them to ask questions that they might not be comfortable asking their teacher for whatever reason.\n\nSome of the features include:\na blog area where the student can type whatever they please that other users can comment on and correct\n\na question forum where the student can ask questions in either English or their native language about English or American culture and receive answers in either English or their native language \n\na tutoring feature (for a fee) that the student can get informal tutoring where they can get one on one attention\n\na teaching feature (for a fee) where they can also get one on one attention from a certified instructor\n\nThere are only 2 issues I have with using this as a resource that I would look opinions on - the first being that one of the features is that you can meet people from all over world - the point being you can skype with a 'language partner' and the student teaches their native language and their partner teaches them English - this service is free but I know you all see the problem with this - Lord knows how many creepers could get in contact with the student and I would never forgive myself is something happened because of a resource I gave them\n\nThe other problem is that I would be afraid that the student would feel like they have to use this website, that they have to use the teaching service and pay for it out of their own pocket. I want to emphasize that this is completely by choice and that I would never expect them to use it (and pay for it) if they don't want to.\n\nSo my questions are - Is it even worth mentioning?\n\nWhat if I have the students do it in class with me present so I can see what they're up to? Or perhaps have them give me their username and password so I can check their accounts from time to time?\n\nI would really appreciate any advice!",

Hey all,\n\nI am currently applying to clerkships, and I just came across this gem from Federal Judge Victoria Roberts: \"My preference is to hire clerks with ties to Detroit, to BALSA and to Just The Beginning.\" She posted this on Oscar.\n\nBALSA= Black American Law Students Association. So, she is actually saying: \"I prefer to hire black clerks.\" How is this legal? I understand how race can be looked up as a \"plus\" factor as a key to diversity, etc. But it seems highly unconstitutional/illegal for a person working in the federal government to flat out say: \"I prefer to hire black people\" for this government job.

Then he goes on explaining what the rally is about and that it's a white nationalist rally and there will be counter protestors there. So obviously as any sane American, I dismiss it because obviously it's horrendous. And then the uber driver is like, now you don't know what they're all about, so he can't judge them and neither can I. And I'm like whaaaaaaaa. Wtf. And then my friend who's in the car with me AGREES with the Uber driver ...  \n  \nSo I'm like.... Me judging??? WHAT!? you can't be serious. And then the Uber driver is saying how they claim they're not Nazis and so yadda. And then my friend goes, you're not listening. Because I said I was not judging them based on nothing, but on their effing ideology. And so the car ride consisted of me actually having this surreal conversation with a friend and a stranger who is literally defending white nationalism and have reversed the conversation by saying that I'm being the short sighted one.  \n  \nSo we make it to our destination and I'm livid with this friend. And he's like chastising me that when I hear conversation like that, I'm not supposed to engage it. And I'm thinking, this friend was the one that started the conversation with him and engaged him in the first place. And he realized this after I stated it. Then I say that he agreed with the fool. And then he's like, he has to worry about being deported so he always is careful with what he says. And then says I HAVE PRIVILEGE for being a citizen. .......  I call him out on his paranoia and say that what you stand for is what you stand for and there's no fear that can make someone defend white nationalism.....  And by his absurd logic, the more \"American\" thing to do was to oppose.  \n  \nAnyway, I'm livid and honestly don't want to be friends with him anymore after that. I can't believe that happened.",

    "text": "Judge: Suspensions OK For Albany High Students Who ‘Liked’ Racist Posts https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/11/30/judge-suspensions-ok-albany-high-students-racist-posts/\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — An East Bay school district acted properly when it suspended five students who “liked” or commented on racist images on another student’s Instagram account that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach and comparisons of African-American women and students to gorillas, a judge has ruled.\n\nThe case raised thorny questions about how strictly schools can regulate student speech and whether “likes” on social media should be treated similarly to the original posts.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Donato said in his decision late Wednesday the five students contributed to disruption at Albany High School in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nThe judge rejected arguments that the Albany Unified School District violated the students’ free speech rights because the offensive posts were on a private account and made off campus.\n\nDonato said the accounts’ followers were mainly Albany High School students. The posts pictured students and school employees and created a risk of substantial disruption at the school, the judge said.\n\n“These cases establish that students have the right to be free of online posts that denigrate their race, ethnicity or physical appearance, or threaten violence,” he said. “They have an equivalent right to enjoy an education in a civil, secure, and safe school environment.”\n\nAn attorney for three of the students had no immediate comment. An attorney for the other two, Darryl Yorkey, said “liking” images does not necessarily express approval.\n\n“I think the judge took an opinion that many of us do in the older generations in assuming that a ‘like’ on its face is just that, ‘I like it, I approve of it,'” he said.\n\nHe said many of the students who were suspended over the images were Asian and were just trying to shock each other.\n\n“Taken out of that context, it definitely looks really bad,” he said. He did not immediately know whether his clients would appeal Donato’s ruling.\n\nA phone message left with the school district seeking comment on the ruling was not immediately returned.\n\nA male student identified in court documents only as “C.E.” created the account in November 2016 and posted on it over the next several months.\n\nOne post showed a screenshot of a female African American student that she had captioned, “I wanna go back to the old way.”\n\nC.E. juxtaposed an image on the student’s post of a white man beating a black slave hung by his hands, according to Donato’s ruling.\n\nSchool officials learned about the account in March. They called in mental health counselors to help calm students and contacted police over concerns references to lynching, nooses and the Ku Klux Klan in the posts could constitute threats of violence, Donato said.\n\nC.E. was suspended and later expelled. Donato upheld his discipline as well on Wednesday.\n\nBut the judge said the district went too far when it disciplined two other students. One followed the account but appeared to have done nothing else and the other commented that the account was “racism solely directed at black people” with an emoji of a laughing face, the judge said.\n\nThe judge overturned their suspensions.",

    "text": "Born and raised As-Am but I refuse to be ashamed of who I am. I'm Chinese - and China has been stereotyped as the world's sweatshop, people with weird eyes, dog eaters and other undesirable things. I also grew up an Asian American, who didn't see race until late high school, but before I could fully understand it, I went back home to China. \n\nMy mom used to microwave vegetable buns she bought from Chinatown for my lunch and I used to bring all sorts of Chinese food for lunch. It got to a point where even other Asians in class started blaming me whenever they smelled something funky. I never once assumed that the way I looked or the food I ate was weird because that's who I was, though luckily for me, nobody made a big deal out of it because I grew up in a diverse neighborhood.\n\nBut as I grew older and traveled beyond my racially diverse, lower-middle class coastal American city, I've noticed that I've slowly become the \"other\" in society. I've begun slight changes in the way people approached me, a certain coldness or strangers acting weirdly confident around me because they assumed or knew I wasn't a local.\n\nWell, I now live in China and I'm past the age where anger was my response to the world. I've accepted that this is the way things are, and all I can say is - it's made things a lot easier for me. I'm a Chinese person who speaks great English and that's who I am - no more dwelling on what my cultural identity is or how I should change who I am just so I can fit in with everyone else. I don't have to be sorry for being Chinese abroad or the fact that I speak great English in China, and I do feel sorry for anyone who doesn't agree. What's there to lose? They'll judge you anyway, do as you wish.\n\nEven though I live in China now, I am still a citizen of another country in the anglosphere, and through that I hope to retain my Westernized Asian identity to the best I can. I also hope I can make friends with other non-Asians who settle in China, but only if they show they have a basic respect of the local culture. I also hope that, through charitable organizations, I can support non-Chinese, non-Han minorities who are born and raised here but sadly isolated from the rest of our society. Is it only because of my experience as an Asian American do I understand what it means to be \"other\", and I am better because of it.\n\nI will respect you when I'm in your house, and you will too when you're in mine - but I will make no concessions regarding who I am, and that applies wherever I go. Place your two feet firmly on the ground and make the world move for you. \n\nIt's that simple.",

Well India & Asia suck even more!! You are ungrateful minorities!\" and things of that nature.\n\nI usually try to stay away from vids & dark parts of the net like that where I know it'll get me mad/depressed or affect my mental health.

    "text": "Romance is dead There is a widespread misconception that women are hopeless romantics.   Turns out it's the other way around.  \n\n>So let’s start with how men and women score on the most well-known measure of romanticism, the Romantic Beliefs Scale.2 This questionnaire asks people to rate the extent to which they agree with statements like, “There will only be one real love for me,\" “If I love someone, I know I can make the relationship work, despite any obstacles,\" and, \"The person I love will make a perfect romantic partner; he/she will be completely accepting, loving, and understanding.”\n\n>The researchers who developed the scale have found that, on average, men outscore women\n\n[Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/close-encounters/201408/whos-really-more-romantic-men-or-women)\n\nAlas, the dual assaults of feminism and globalization are leaving huge numbers of men with no romantic prospects.   Why?   Because despite what feminists initially claimed, hypergamy doesn't suddenly disappear when women achieve financial stability and increased social status.   \n\n[Article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-men-are-having-problems-getting-married/) from CBS notes:\n\n>That meshes with the problems facing younger American men who lack college degrees. In 1990, more than 17 percent of men between 18 to 39 worked in manufacturing, but by 2007 that had declined to about 11 percent, Autor and his co-researchers found. Fewer job opportunities reduce “the supply of young men who would likely be judged as **good marital prospects**,” they noted. \n\n>It’s not only that young working-class men are less marriageable when jobs dry up, but that some of these men are actually disappearing, the paper noted. \n\n>Where are these young men going? Many are turning to risky behaviors such as heavy drinking and drug use. Trade shocks are leading to higher mortality rates for young men, which explains some -- but not all -- of the imbalance. Young men are also disappearing because they’re incarcerated, homeless or migrating to other areas to find better job opportunities. \n\nSo in other words, working class men are doing horribly.   \n\nBut not to worry gents, just as feminists are determined to create gender equality in the political and legal spheres (cough), they are doing their best to help working class men achieve decent employment and therefore a chance at having a happy relationship.   Oh wait...\n\n>A \"man-cession.\" That's what some economists are starting to call it. Of the 5.7 million jobs Americans lost between December 2007 and May 2009, nearly 80 percent had been held by men. Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan, characterizes the recession as a \"downturn\" for women but a \"catastrophe\" for men.\n\n>Last November, President-elect Obama addressed the devastation in the construction and manufacturing industries by proposing an ambitious New Deal-like program to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. He called for a two-year \"shovel ready\" stimulus program to modernize roads, bridges, schools, electrical grids, public transportation, and dams and made reinvigorating the hardest-hit sectors of the economy the goal of the legislation that would become the recovery act.\n\n>Women's groups were appalled. Grids? Dams? Opinion pieces immediately appeared in major newspapers with titles like \"Where are the New Jobs for Women?\" and \"The Macho Stimulus Plan.\" A group of \"notable feminist economists\" circulated a petition that quickly garnered more than 600 signatures, calling on the president-elect to add projects in health, child care, education, and social services and to \"institute apprenticeships\" to train women for \"at least one third\" of the infrastructure jobs. At the same time, more than 1,000 feminist historians signed an open letter urging Obama not to favor a \"heavily male-dominated field\" like construction: \"We need to rebuild not only concrete and steel bridges but also human bridges.\" As soon as these groups became aware of each other, they formed an anti-stimulus plan action group called WEAVE-- Women's Equality Adds Value to the Economy.\n\n[source](http://www.weeklystandard.com/no-country-for-burly-men/article/17737)\n\nFor a group of people who so often call themselves \"socialists\" they sure seem hellbent on harming working class men.   There is however a silver lining to the death of romance.    Thanks to feminism marriage no longer provides any benefit to men, and on the contrary is an exceedingly risky proposition.   Therefore working class men are ultimately being spared a life of misery.   \n\nStill, being alone is another type of misery.   In one sense men are being freed, but on the other the loss of love is tragic.   Most men aren't suited to monk lifestyles.   They are being forced into this position out of a combination of hypergamy run amok and anti-male laws.   \n\nLest there be any confusion, working class men are not some minor part of the economy.   They are the people who maintain civilization.    \n\nUnless the MRM succeeds, I anticipate that the Japanese herbivore phenomenon will rapidly go global.   It may spread so quickly that people won't even realize what's happening before it's too late.   When I first saw Karen Straughan's video \"Fempocalypse\" I assumed she was engaging in hyperbole.  Now I'm not so sure...",

    "text": "You are Equal: I'm sorry Here is my response to the \"you are not equal, I'm sorry\" letter.  First, the letter in it's entirety, followed by my reply.\n\n\"Say Thank You\n\nSay thank you. Say thank you to the women who gave you a voice. Say thank you to the women who were arrested and imprisoned and beaten and gassed for you to have a voice. Say thank you to the women who refused to back down, to the women who fought tirelessly to give you a voice. Say thank you to the women who put their lives on hold, who –lucky for you — did not have “better things to do” than to march and protest and rally for your voice. So you don’t feel like a “second class citizen.” So you get to feel “equal.”\n\nThank Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul for your right to vote.\n\nThank Elizabeth Stanton for your right to work.\n\nThank Maud Wood Park for your prenatal care and your identity outside of your husband.\n\nThank Rose Schneiderman for your humane working conditions.\n\nThank Eleanor Roosevelt and Molly Dewson for your ability to work in politics and affect policy.\n\nThank Margaret Sanger for your legal birth control.\n\nThank Carol Downer for your reproductive healthcare rights.\n\nThank Sarah Muller for your equal education.\n\nThank Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shannon Turner, Gloria Steinem, Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis, Malika Saada Saar, Wagatwe Wanjuki, Ida B. Wells, Malala Yousafzai. Thank your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother who did not have half of the rights you have now.\n\nYou can make your own choices, speak and be heard, vote, work, control your body, defend yourself, defend your family, because of the women who marched. You did nothing to earn those rights. You were born into those rights. You did nothing, but you reap the benefits of women, strong women, women who fought misogyny and pushed through patriarchy and fought for you. And you sit on your pedestal, a pedestal you are fortunate enough to have, and type. A keyboard warrior. A fighter for complacency. An acceptor of what you were given. A denier of facts. Wrapped up in your delusion of equality.\n\nYou are not equal. Even if you feel like you are. You still make less than a man for doing the same work. You make less as a CEO, as an athlete, as an actress, as a doctor. You make less in government, in the tech industry, in healthcare.\n\nYou still don’t have full rights over your own body. Men are still debating over your uterus. Over your prenatal care. Over your choices.\n\nYou still have to pay taxes for your basic sanitary needs.\n\nYou still have to carry mace when walking alone at night. You still have to prove to the court why you were drunk on the night you were raped. You still have to justify your behavior when a man forces himself on you.\n\nYou still don’t have paid (or even unpaid) maternity leave. You still have to go back to work while your body is broken. While you silently suffer from postpartum depression.\n\nYou still have to fight to breastfeed in public. You still have to prove to other women it’s your right to do so. You still offend others with your breasts.\n\nYou are still objectified. You are still catcalled. You are still sexualized. You are still told you’re too skinny or you’re too fat. You’re still told you’re too old or too young. You’re applauded when you “age gracefully.” You’re still told men age “better.” You’re still told to dress like a lady. You are still judged on your outfit instead of what’s in your head. What brand bag you have still matters more than your college degree.\n\nYou are still being abused by your husband, by your boyfriend. You’re still being murdered by your partners. Being beaten by your soulmate.\n\nYou are still worse off if you are a woman of color, a gay woman, a transgender woman. You are still harassed, belittled, dehumanized.\n\nYour daughters are still told they are beautiful before they are told they are smart. Your daughters are still told to behave even though “boys will be boys.” Your daughters are still told boys pull hair or pinch them because they like them.\n\nYou are not equal. Your daughters are not equal. You are still systemically oppressed.\n\nEstonia allows parents to take up to three years of leave, fully paid for the first 435 days. United States has no policy requiring maternity leave.\n\nSingapore’s women feel safe walking alone at night. American women do not.\n\nNew Zealand’s women have the smallest gender gap in wages, at 5.6%. United States’ pay gap is 20%.\n\nIceland has the highest number of women CEOs, at 44%. United States is at 4.0%.\n\nThe United States ranks at 45 for women’s equality. Behind Rwanda, Cuba, Philippines, Jamaica.\n\nBut I get it. You don’t want to admit it. You don’t want to be a victim. You think feminism is a dirty word. You think it’s not classy to fight for equality. You hate the word pussy. Unless of course you use it to call a man who isn’t up to your standard of manhood. You know the type of man that “allows” “his” woman to do whatever she damn well pleases. I get it. You believe feminists are emotional, irrational, unreasonable. Why aren’t women just satisfied with their lives, right? You get what you get and you don’t get upset, right?\n\nI get it. You want to feel empowered. You don’t want to believe you’re oppressed. Because that would mean you are indeed a “second-class citizen.” You don’t want to feel like one. I get it. But don’t worry. I will walk for you. I will walk for your daughter. And your daughter’s daughter. And maybe you will still believe the world did not change. You will believe you’ve always had the rights you have today. And that’s okay. Because women who actually care and support other women don’t care what you think about them. They care about their future and the future of the women who come after them.\n\nOpen your eyes. Open them wide. Because I’m here to tell you, along with millions of other women that you are not equal. Our equality is an illusion. A feel-good sleight of hand. A trick of the mind. I’m sorry to tell you, but you are not equal. And neither are your daughters.\n\nBut don’t worry. We will walk for you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you. And one day you will actually be equal, instead of just feeling like you are.\"\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\nMy reply: \n\n\nI think you misunderstand the concept of \"equality\". \n\nEquality means that nobody is inherently considered to be better than someone else because of superficial qualities. It means that we have laws to prevent someone from using those superficial qualities as a basis for making decisions regarding opportunity. \n\nLet's examine your complaints one by one:\n\nYou list over a dozen women who should be thanked for fighting for the rights that women have today. Which, is all the same rights as men have (plus a few more). \nThen you double back and say basically that you can pretend that you have equal rights, but you're a fool denying all the work done by those before you.  So...  look more closely at that. The *ACCOMPLISHMENTS* of those women are what earned you equal rights. Yes. Say THANK YOU. Say it often and mean it, because you have equal rights. today. right now. You do. \n\nImmediately you plummet into the wage gap myth. Let's use some tired cliche' obvious answers of why this is stupid. \n1. If I could pay a team of primarily women approx. 75% of what I would pay an equivalent group of men, why would I not hire primarily women and save up to 25% on my largest expense as a business owner, human resources?\n2. The differences in pay between men and women in the sighted fields is normally on the level of 5 or 6 cents to the dollar. an amount easily attributed to a variety of things, but certainly not solely determined by sexism. I'll grant you that it is possible it is a factor, but if I were a betting man I'd wager an argument could be made to show sexism acounts for less than 1% of the discrepancy. \n3. Let's factor in the wages paid for jobs likely to harm or kill you. An industry happily left to men, who make up over 95% of workplace deaths. This means that jobs likely to harm or kill you are likely at least 90% men. Meaning that when you have no education, and you need to make good money, risking your life will earn you more money. Add to this the understanding that girls and women graduate high school and college in greater numbers than boys and men. \n4. young childless women, in their mid 20s, are out-earning their male counterparts. \n\nWomen aren't treated poorly in the workplace as a commonality. They gravitate towards different fields of work. There are anti discrimination laws, if someone is violating those laws, report them. use social media, expose them. Believe me, the world is watching, and very few of them would want to miss out on a chance to support a woman fighting oppression.\n\nYou go on to complain about men discussing your uterus, and your body...  So, what you mean is that men elected by a population of voters made up of men and women, where at least half don't vote, decide details of laws surrounding abortion and reproductive rights. \nCurrently you have the federal right to seek an abortion. You have literally hundreds of birth control options, ranging from hormonal daily pills, to semi monthly injections, implants, non-hormonal options...  etc. Many/most of these options are covered by health care, by law. Men have one option: condoms. Besides condoms men are told to either accept the risk of sex, or not have it at all. \nIf I meet a girl, she says \"I'm on birth control injections, and I would abort as soon as I found out if something happened anyway, I'm totally not interested in having kids at this point in my life.\". We have sex that night. we see each other another few times, and it kinda fizzles out. 4 weeks later she calls me and says \"I'm pregnant, and I know I said I would abort but I'm keeping it. It's yours\", you have no choice in the matter. You are now legally accountable for that kid for 18 years. \nIf you put that sort of lack of choice upon women, suddenly it sounds like the worst thing ever. Imagine, if a man could say \"fuck no, you're having this child, I'll take custody, and you pay me monthly to raise it, I know I agreed that abortion was what we would do if birth control failed, but I actually want a kid now, so you'll have it and I'll take it, and you help pay for it, and you can see it on weekends if you want.\"  no. If you said \"Well if you don't like the concept of being forced to have a child if you get pregnant, then don't have sex\".  This is literally the choice men have. We can trust a woman at her word, and then she can change her mind and we are legally responsible for that kid. This is not equality, not at all. when the suggestion of the \"financial abortion\" is made, that a man can tell a woman \"I will not raise a child with you, I am opting out legally from raising this child or ever having a right to be in this child's life\" you have to release that man from being a legal parent. This would have to occur within a time frame during pregnancy the same as a biological abortion. This allows women their choice of being single parents, or aborting in the case that they decided to keep an accidental pregnancy. This allows men to be held to their word, as well as women to be held to theirs. This allows equality of choice, and reproductive rights.  \nI also wonder where feminism is on helping to promote Vasalgel, which would greatly reduce the rate of accidental pregnancy in the first place, and give men a powerful option for birth control methods, putting them a step closer to women in terms of this right. \n\nTaxes on \"basic sanitary needs\".  you are talking about equality to men, right? we pay taxes on our basic sanitary needs all the time. razors and toilet paper and tissues, and talcum powders, and deoderants...  of course we pay taxes on those items. If you have a complaint that items like sanitary goods shouldnt be taxed, that is fine, I probably would support that. But I don't see how you believe that is an issue of inequality to men. \n\nThe letter talks after this about having to \"justify their actions after a man forces himself on them\" right. you have to recount exactly how it happened to the police, who will investigate the incident. You have to explain to police when there is a potential element of consent involved that you had clearly communicated you were not consenting, and how you did that. So the police will ask you detailed questions all about the incident so they can do their job as best as possible. You giving a strong account of an event will help your case. the police are trying to help you.  this is not inequality. If I am attacked by someone, and I break their nose and jaw defending myself, and yet I'm untouched claiming to have been attacked, I'm going to have some detailed explanations to make, aren't I? and here I am the victim, being interrogated!? Yes. Because your story is a very important element of the incident. \n\nYou follow this by mentioning that women don't have paid maternity leave. Do men have paid paternity leave? \nOh...  women in other countries have it, gotcha, Because this was supposed to be about how you're not equal to men, wasn't it? Sure, work to get paid maternity leave, work to get all the things you believe would improve out society. But don't claim it is a factor of inequality. Because it's just something you want the government to regulate about business, and you cannot simply stuff socialist concepts down people's throat without a spoonfull of oppression to make it slide down a little easier. This again is not an inequality, and I've yet to see an actual right you lack that men have. \n\nThe next topic is breastfeeding. I don't really know if there are any laws preventing this, but I'm fairly sure that most laws allow for it, making an exclusion to indecency laws for breastfeeding in public. I think people who give others a hard time for this are shitty people. It isn't something men do though, so it's not an inequality, it's also (to my knowledge) not regulated as being illegal. So it's mainly social pressure and commentary that is being complained about. Again, not a right being denied to women that is granted to men. If women want to urge the law to let them be topless as it does in various parts of the country, go for it. Just don't expect men to stop looking at tittys. That's never going to happen. \n\nThe next part discusses social pressures and criticisms of things like appearance and then references being judged for the brand of high end hand bag she carries rather than her degree.....  by who? BY WHO!? I don't know any men who would know the brand of the handbag, but they might judge you by your degree. A degree she is more likely to have than a man, on average, by the way.  You are judged differently from men on your appearance? probably. But if you believe men aren't objectified you're crazy. If you think men aren't catcalled you're crazy. You simply can't see what your feminist lenses filter out. This is not inequality. There is no law that can prevent how people see other people. and your depiction of judgement for the high end handbag over the college degree just stinks of your inability to see just how insane your privilege theory really is. \n\nNext up is spousal abuse and rape, followed by the privilege stack listing off people worse off than white men.  Let's take them one at a time. The deluth model makes sure men are arrested when they are the abused. The lack of men's shelters helps to ensure that there are no resources for men to get themselves and their children out of abusive homes. If they go to the CPS, they may lose their children all together, because of the lack of understanding of abused men in our society. You ignore half of the abuse sufferers because of their gender, and act like women are the ones who are invisible. Just google \"men's shelter closes\" and read.  That's feminism. that's your equality. You want to know a little nugget of info that should help you understand how much you don't understand this situation? Lesbian couples have the highest rates of spousal abuse. \n\nFollowing this you compare the USA to various other nations. \n\nSingapore, Estonia, Iceland, New Zealand. You understand that your request for equality is all over the map, you want to have the benefits of socialist systems for yourself, but you also idolize what some of the least diverse nations on the planet are able to do by being a strongly nationalist society. They have some of the most strict immigration laws in the world, while america remains to have one of the most permissive. None of this has any bearing on your equality to American men. \n\nThe next paragraph essentially creates a straw man out of the sort of person who would claim to be on equal footing to men in America. The author essentially paints a picture of a woman who says she isn't a victim, and doesn't see the world through the feminist lens. Then scoffs at this straw man, claiming she get's it. It's because these sort of women cannot bear to understand their victimized place in society, that these women who don't walk around feeling the victimhood of womanhood are simply too weak to handle the realities of our world, and their place in it. The existence of successful women, and the individuals who are doing well in life are tossed aside, with the explanation that just because a woman can make patriarchy work for her doesn't mean she isn't still oppressed... Right. It's amazing how the writer of this article can start off the list thanking all those who won her the equal rights she enjoys today, turn around and deny the equal rights she has, and then list off a bunch of factors that have nothing to do with equality, simply are issues feminism/some women have with modern society or government policy in America. Though not one can be held up as a right other citizens have that they are denied. Not one can be listed as a \"human right\" and not one can be looked at as anything more than a first world complaint when compared to what women around the world deal with. \n\nShe ends the list having never sighted one thing men have that women don't, but that she will keep fighting to make she she gets those equal rights, because even though you might feel equal in your life, you really aren't because you're eyes aren't opened, and focused through the feminist lens to see how horribly you have it.  \n\n\nHere is a list of rights women have that men do not: \n\nWomen are able to register to vote without a social contract of selective military service. Men may not register to vote without selective service registration. Failure to register for the selective service may result in fines or jail time. \n\nWomen have the only legal control grated over reproductive rights. Men have the option to use birth control or abstain from sex in order to control their reproductive rights. \n\nWomen in the USA aren't allowed to have part of their genitals removed at birth. Male genital mutilation is considered normal in the USA.\n\nIn several states, men cannot be \"raped\" by a woman. Rape is only considered to be penetrated, but being forced to penetrate is not called rape. Further, you'll notice when a little boy is raped by a woman, they call it an affair, or sex, but not rape. \n\nAnway, that's about it. Legally we are pretty much on equal ground. So when you discuss the issues, call it what it is. You are fighting for womens rights, and women's issues. But not equality. You thanked the women in the first part of your letter who gave you that. Maybe stop shitting all over their work by claiming it didn't accomplish all that it has. You have all the legal rights of men in your nation, and then some.",

    "text": "Right wing groups judge each other on how they treat their women. This article seems to be another example of competing right wing groups judging each other on the basis of how they treat their women.\n\nhttp://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/far-right-audiences-drag-two-of-their-favorite-female-pundits-for-not-having-children/\n\nIn this case it seems to be a \"Deep State\" / anti-Trump style of web site that's attacking the \"alt-right\".  Look at how mean the alt-right is to it's women they say.  Of course the whole sexual harassment witch hunt has kind of exploded on the \"Deep State\" side of things recently with Franken and others being accused which has given their right wing opponents the opportunity to make a charge of hypcrisy in treating \"their own women\" wrong.\n\nI was thinking to myself that you'd never see an article like the one above that featured men instead of women.  Fundamentally women's rights (and feminism) tends to be a right wing thing because of the way that being seen as the champion of \"the little ladies\" is a safe badge of honour among men at the top of the heap.  And it's always been this way.  We know going back to the earliest laws in history, the bible and the code of Hammurabi, that women get special treatment and protections from the male leaders at the top of the heap.\n\nI've observed before that this is true whether it's the Taliban and the American elites criticising each other over how badly they treat their women, or whether it's jurists in 18th century England talking about how much better a society they had compared to the bad old days of the 17th century when it was lawful for men to beat their wives with a stick \"no wider than their thumb\" (a law which was entirely fictional and may have been made up purely to brag at how much better at treating women the then modern society had become).\n\nMen at the top love to be the champions of women.  And that's how they brag about their society.  They don't care about men's lives under them of course, or positively seek to make them worse because those men are a threat.  This is a sexual relationship so basic you see it with animals.  So-called patriarchy loves giving privileges to women and undermining men.\n\nBut these traditional or even natural hierarchies are right wing politics.  The Left comes along and it's basis is the concept that all men are equal.  It's revolutionary.  It's demanding worker's rights (ie men's rights). It's the labor movement, unions, communism.  In this sense I would say that men's rights is naturally aligned with the Left as it has been historically, whereas the authoritarian / right wing hierarchy or \"patriarchy\" style of society has always benefited women.\n\nHow then has it come to be seen as the reverse in recent decades?  The only thing that is different is the rise of the feminist movement and it's identification as on the left.  Don't notice that the right wing governments are funding feminism to the tune of billions of dollars.  Don't notice that feminism has undermined the Left and divided it up in pursuit of right-wing / tribalist style identity based politics.  If we accept what feminists say about themselves uncritically they claim to be for equality and for left wing politics.  In reality they oppose both.  The difference between left and right is largely defined in any case on the basis of two things: attitudes towards equality and attitudes towards authority.  And those are similar things.  Do you support the natural hierarchies or do you say no, everyone should be equal?  Those who claim that feminists are the left wing do so on the basis only of what feminists claim about themselves.  But we know feminists falsely claim to want equality, and it is only logical to question their claim to be on the left.\n\nWomen's rights and privileges are a thing that has always been around.  It's not radical.  It's the status quo.  So old even other social animals in the wild do it.  Men's rights - meaning not the power of men at the top of the heap, but men at the bottom of the heap - is a new idea.  It's revolutionary.  it cuts at the very basis of society by undermining the existing authority.  By the very definition of what we mean by \"left\" and \"right\" wing politics these concepts of radical equality and rejecting the status quo hierarchy places men's rights on the Left and this is also why women's rights advocates have always been pushing on an open door, whereas men's rights advocates have always been attacked by those in power.",

    "text": "The real reason women are not represented in tech First, I want to clarify I do not agree with the basis that women are not biologically suitable for roles in tech. I am much more inclined to believe it has to do with culture, and a good hard example against women being biologically inferior would be the country of Iran, where women make up the majority of engineers. Now granted, Iran has segregated schools between men and women, and they are under a theocracy, but if your basis was of biological merit, then this would be a good hard example to prove otherwise.\n\nNow, I will say that culture, primarily American culture, plays a huge role. \n\nLet's think back to middle school tech-ed courses, and think of the demographic in play. White/Asian nerdy boys primarily, a few hispanic and black nerds, and once in a while a nerdy girl. \n\nThis demographic holds true throughout high school. I would know, I was a guy who took tech ed courses in middle school/high school between two secondary schools, and this demographic holds true in hackathons, coding conventions, tech conventions, and..... tech jobs!\n\nBut why? Why do women, aside from a minority number, shy away from tech? Because of nerd culture. Yep, I'm just keeping it 100% honest here. Nobody likes nerds, besides other nerds. As someone who graduated from high school in 2015, the same stereotypes from 2-3 decades ago still hold true.\n\nNerds don't have friends to sit with at lunch, they are too autistic to make friends, and ESPECIALLY girlfriends, they are easy to pick on, and on the social hierarchy in high school they are at the very bottom.\n\nSo they fall back on tech, video games, and porn. And now you know why 90% of league players are males, just as the majority of competitive PC gamers are males. Men have a culture to fall back on, women do not. If women try to join this culture, lets say they play league, they will get hit on constantly for being a women. It's not fun, unless your aim is to make money from it by being a titty streamer of course.\n\nCompare this to a country like Iran, where western high school culture is non-existent, girls and boys are separate until 18, and girls are brought into tech collectively, where they can enjoy the subject without being hit on constantly, and without being judged.\n\nThis is not to say we need a theocracy. Hell, I'm agnostic myself. But I am saying that different cultures breed different peoples, and that our current nerd-normal people-jock culture cannot produce an equal outcome for both genders.\n\nUnless of course we mandate the subject, which could change things drastically. \n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts.",

I didn't like most of them, but there was one that I really fell in love with. I was referred to it by a friend I met here.\n\nThey had five rounds (initial screen, case study, interview with team leader, interview with branch leaders, interview with CEO).\nI think the fifth \"round\" is more of a formality, and once you finished round 4, you're chosen for the job.\n\nI finished round 4, but I was informed that I was a very very close 2nd place for the role. They said they really liked me and they definitely want to bring me onboard, but someone else who was a bit more qualified got the role. They said they might open up a new position after the summer and it sounded like I could automatically have it offered to me.\n\nI researched this company a LOT, and I have no doubts that they'll open up more positions in the near future. And I absolutely love what they do, what the role is, every employee I've met during this process. The team manager e-mailed me herself, and it definitely wasn't one of those \"we'll keep your CV on file and contact you blah blah\" bullshit e-mails. I really do think there's something for me at their company and a position could definitely open up for me.\n\nMy problem is, what do I do until then? I'm sending out applications to other companies, but frankly, they all seem less exciting than this company, not to mention much more corporate. Money is starting to get a bit tight, and I'm not legally allowed to work unless a company sponsors me.\n\nI really think this company will open up a new position that I can fill, but should I trust that? If another company offers me a position, should I accept knowing that I'd enjoy it way less? I should note that I have a time limit because of my VISA.\n\nWould love to hear your take on all this :)\nThanks in advance Redditors",

    "text": "Had a terrible week at work, is the problem me or the environment? I've been in my current job for 6 months and it's had its ups and downs, though recently it has been mostly down. To add some context, it's my first serious job and I'm pretty young compared to all of my colleagues, I'd say that out of 20 staff only 1 or 2 are less than 10 years old than me. My boss seems constantly stressed as he's also the owner of the company and my role has very vague boundaries, I taking incoming calls and process orders which don't always occupy my 9-5, so my colleagues hand me work daily that they can't/don't want to do. The hierarchy is also vague as we have a manager who is constantly usurped by the CEO who spends most of the time in our office. I'm often seen as a rank below the other staff thanks to the nature of my role and probably my age.\n\nAnyway, in the last week, I've been called a \"poof\" (equivalent of \"fag\" for American readers) and had continuous jokes about me being a domestic abuse victim. All this was said in front of about 8 members of staff and multiple people took part. On top of this, my boss is a complete jerk and is consistently rude to me, going so far as to threaten me with destruction of my property (phone, bag, etc), \"throwing me out the window\" and firing me if I didn't perform a particular task correctly. He'll invent rules just for me and will get angry if I point out the same behaviour around the office. Literally everything I say to him comes back to hurt me and, even though my manager assures me the opposite, I honestly believe he dislikes me.\n\nAfter I complained about what was said this week, they handed me a \"letter of consent\" (i.e. a written warning) about breaking some of the rules I explained above too often. Also, my 6 month probation has been extended to 9 months. I'm basically miserable at the moment and it's the second time I've been this low in the last month or so thanks to this job. I'm not sure what my next step should be.",

    "text": "How do I know if I should quit my job as a junior developer? I'm a junior dev at a startup in New York. When I joined the company I didn't have any experience or a degree but even with that in mind, I'd still say my knowledge of Ruby/RoR at least was *approaching* that of a mid-level developer. The only company that would give me a job at the time primarily use Golang, which I sorta knew but not really. I told them this and they said it'd be cool and that I could work on one or two minor Ruby projects and do some customer support (everyone at the company was expected to do this back then) before eventually progressing to a mid-level role and working on Go code.\n\nSo it's been six months now and I feel that while my understanding of Go and the technologies my company specializes in have improved, they haven't improved anywhere near fast enough. There wasn't really much of a dev team when I joined (it was just me, another junior developer, a contractor and our CEO alongside less technical members of senior management). The CEO left the country a few months ago and now works from home but even when he was around, he was often pretty much doing his own thing and we were left to our own devices much of the time. Even now that they've hired more experienced staff, I still feel like I'm not getting the level of support I need. I don't expect anyone to teach me Go and I try not ask questions about it unless it becomes a blocker. But often when I raise a question about the way in which our core product functions in the company's Slack channel, I'm either ignored, forced to make do with the fact that nobody in my time zone understands the code well enough to know the answer, given answers that confuse more than help or, on rare occasions, belittled for not knowing the answer already even though everyone knows how much the existing documentation sucks. As a result, I often feel overwhelmed by the support side of my role and even on days where there are barely any user queries, I'm plagued by issues with the build environment that nobody can ever help me with or assigned confusing tasks that seemingly no one understands. I don't even really get to code all that much and often just feel more like an overpaid application support engineer than a developer.\n\nI don't know if this is all just growing pains and if I should just keep at it or if this really is a bad environment for me. Even though I feel really lonely most of the time (most of the other developers work from home in different states and I actually don't have that much in common with any of them - I'm the only African American and one of only three women in the company, I'm the only developer who doesn't either have a CS degree or 5 years+ of experience, etc.), I do actually really like the people I work with. At the same time, I worry that I might be being taken advantage of, which just tends to happen to me a lot in general. I've considered leaving but I'm also conscious of the fact that almost none of the code I've worked on in the last six months has been made public so, to a potential employer, I'd look as though I were in the same position as I was back when I was looking for a job six months ago.\n\nAny thoughts?",

    "text": "There Are Only 23 Black Owned Banks Left in America > Black-Owned Banks Hit Their Peak a Century Ago \n\n> In late 19th and early 20th century, 57 black-owned charter banks entered the system\n\n> Black-owned banks arose and flourished in a period when African-Americans were kept out of other financial institutions, both overtly and through practices that effectively walled off their neighborhoods from other banks.\n\n> The sector hit a peak in the late 19th and early 20th century, a period when 57 black-owned banks and credit unions existed. \n\n> Six CEOs of black-owned banks locked themselves in a New Orleans conference room for more than a day in late 2016. Surrounded by papers, drawing boards and PowerPoints, the group strategized ways to reverse a trend 15 years in the making: the decline of their own banking sector.\n\n> The number of black-owned banks operating in the U.S. has been dropping steadily for the past 15 years and fell to 23 this year, the lowest level in recent history, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That has left many African-American communities short of access to capital and traditional financial services, according to some banking experts.\n\n> “We have a crisis among black banks,” said Doyle Mitchell, CEO of Washington-based Industrial Bank. “We met…to save the industry. To save ourselves.”\n\n> The 2008 recession hit the black banking sector especially hard, and if the current rate of closures of about two a year, as well as the industry-wide reluctance or inability to start banks, continues, black-owned banks could disappear entirely within the next eight to 12 years.\n\n> The trend is worrisome to some analysts who argue fewer banks serving low-income, minority groups could expand “financial deserts”—communities with few or no banking institutions—and increase the likelihood that black and Hispanic communities could become susceptible to redlining, a discriminatory practice that excludes poorer minority areas from financial services.\n\n> “These banks are banks that serve relatively poor neighborhoods,” said Russell Kashian, an economics professor who studies black-owned banks. “There are neighborhoods that if…the black-owned bank isn’t there, nobody is there.”\n\n> Most black-owned banks typically have a few branches in one city, although one of the category’s largest players, New Orleans-based Liberty Bank, has a multistate presence. Such banks comprise just a sliver of the overall U.S. financial sector, with collective assets of $5.5 billion, versus $16.3 trillion in the industry overall.\n\n> As a result, some economists question the significance of the sector’s decline. “Size-wise they’ve been small,” said Nicholas Lash, a business professor at Loyola University Chicago who studies minority banking. “So their total impact on black communities can’t be very, very large.”\n\n> Yet those who live in communities that have been served by black-owned banks say the impact there, both practical and psychological, is deeply felt. The most recent example is in Chicago, where Illinois state regulators in January closed Seaway Bank & Trust, determining that its financial health had so deteriorated that pumping in more money couldn’t save it.\n\n> “It was like air coming out of a balloon,” said Bob Fioretti, a former Chicago alderman who was previously involved in raising money to keep Seaway open. “People were deflated. Seaway was a standing icon of the community.”\n\n> Seaway, formerly Chicago’s largest black-owned bank, helped anchor the famed black business community on the city’s South Side.\n\n> Claire Adams, a former board president of a South Side Chicago housing community that was one of the first businesses to use Seaway when it opened in 1965, said she now fears that with fewer small, community banks in her part of the city, payday lenders and check-cashing institutions, which often charge exorbitant rates and fees, would be many African-Americans’ only nearby banking option.\n\n> “The only thing that’s left are these predatory institutions,” Ms. Adams said.\n\n> In some areas of the South Side, Seaway was the first bank some African-Americans had access to, making it a symbol of black enterprise and economic development, patrons say. Many speak of the bank with admiration, often mentioning a program that allowed children to open a bank account with a small amount of money.\n\n> “I [could go to] Chase or something…but I like Seaway,” said Nell Robinson, who has used Seaway for more than two decades. “Seaway was here before Chase. It’s a black bank [and], we have to pull our people up.”\n\n> With such concerns in mind, members of the South Side’s religious community raised more than $100,000 in deposits for Seaway in 2016. But the effort wasn’t enough. Seaway was sold to the State Bank of Texas, then sold again to North Carolina-based Self-Help Credit Union.\n\n> A prolonged period of low interest rates and intense competition, as bigger banks slowly move into underserved areas, have combined to contribute to the black banking sector’s decline, even after the recession’s end. Now a practical concern in Chicago and elsewhere is that, even if bigger institutions step in, they won’t be as accommodating in lending to black-owned businesses.\n\n> A survey of entrepreneurs by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2014 found that 47% of black business owners had gotten the full amount of funding requested from banks, credit unions or other financial institutions, compared with 76% of whites.\n\n> That survey also showed fear of rejection was the top reason cited by black business owners who chose not to seek needed capital at all.\n\n> “When I have an applicant that comes into my bank and comes into XYZ large bank, and they’re on the edges, there are things that I can understand and appreciate about their situation that XYZ large bank won’t, and that makes the difference,” Mr. Mitchell, of Industrial Bank, said.\n\nI feel like we have to do whatever we can to keep these financial institutions alive man. Some of these banks & credit unions have been serving us and our communities since before integration. No way we should let them down now by continuing to take our business to people who don't care about or respect us. \n\nI have an account w/ Industrial Bank here in DC which is black owned in fact it was my very first bank account ever. My parents are the reason for this, and I'm proud to say I still do business with them to this day.",

    "text": "You are Equal: I'm sorry Here is my response to the \"you are not equal, I'm sorry\" letter.  First, the letter in it's entirety, followed by my reply.\n\n\"Say Thank You\n\nSay thank you. Say thank you to the women who gave you a voice. Say thank you to the women who were arrested and imprisoned and beaten and gassed for you to have a voice. Say thank you to the women who refused to back down, to the women who fought tirelessly to give you a voice. Say thank you to the women who put their lives on hold, who –lucky for you — did not have “better things to do” than to march and protest and rally for your voice. So you don’t feel like a “second class citizen.” So you get to feel “equal.”\n\nThank Susan B. Anthony and Alice Paul for your right to vote.\n\nThank Elizabeth Stanton for your right to work.\n\nThank Maud Wood Park for your prenatal care and your identity outside of your husband.\n\nThank Rose Schneiderman for your humane working conditions.\n\nThank Eleanor Roosevelt and Molly Dewson for your ability to work in politics and affect policy.\n\nThank Margaret Sanger for your legal birth control.\n\nThank Carol Downer for your reproductive healthcare rights.\n\nThank Sarah Muller for your equal education.\n\nThank Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Shannon Turner, Gloria Steinem, Zelda Kingoff Nordlinger, Rosa Parks, Angela Davis, Malika Saada Saar, Wagatwe Wanjuki, Ida B. Wells, Malala Yousafzai. Thank your mother, your grandmother, your great-grandmother who did not have half of the rights you have now.\n\nYou can make your own choices, speak and be heard, vote, work, control your body, defend yourself, defend your family, because of the women who marched. You did nothing to earn those rights. You were born into those rights. You did nothing, but you reap the benefits of women, strong women, women who fought misogyny and pushed through patriarchy and fought for you. And you sit on your pedestal, a pedestal you are fortunate enough to have, and type. A keyboard warrior. A fighter for complacency. An acceptor of what you were given. A denier of facts. Wrapped up in your delusion of equality.\n\nYou are not equal. Even if you feel like you are. You still make less than a man for doing the same work. You make less as a CEO, as an athlete, as an actress, as a doctor. You make less in government, in the tech industry, in healthcare.\n\nYou still don’t have full rights over your own body. Men are still debating over your uterus. Over your prenatal care. Over your choices.\n\nYou still have to pay taxes for your basic sanitary needs.\n\nYou still have to carry mace when walking alone at night. You still have to prove to the court why you were drunk on the night you were raped. You still have to justify your behavior when a man forces himself on you.\n\nYou still don’t have paid (or even unpaid) maternity leave. You still have to go back to work while your body is broken. While you silently suffer from postpartum depression.\n\nYou still have to fight to breastfeed in public. You still have to prove to other women it’s your right to do so. You still offend others with your breasts.\n\nYou are still objectified. You are still catcalled. You are still sexualized. You are still told you’re too skinny or you’re too fat. You’re still told you’re too old or too young. You’re applauded when you “age gracefully.” You’re still told men age “better.” You’re still told to dress like a lady. You are still judged on your outfit instead of what’s in your head. What brand bag you have still matters more than your college degree.\n\nYou are still being abused by your husband, by your boyfriend. You’re still being murdered by your partners. Being beaten by your soulmate.\n\nYou are still worse off if you are a woman of color, a gay woman, a transgender woman. You are still harassed, belittled, dehumanized.\n\nYour daughters are still told they are beautiful before they are told they are smart. Your daughters are still told to behave even though “boys will be boys.” Your daughters are still told boys pull hair or pinch them because they like them.\n\nYou are not equal. Your daughters are not equal. You are still systemically oppressed.\n\nEstonia allows parents to take up to three years of leave, fully paid for the first 435 days. United States has no policy requiring maternity leave.\n\nSingapore’s women feel safe walking alone at night. American women do not.\n\nNew Zealand’s women have the smallest gender gap in wages, at 5.6%. United States’ pay gap is 20%.\n\nIceland has the highest number of women CEOs, at 44%. United States is at 4.0%.\n\nThe United States ranks at 45 for women’s equality. Behind Rwanda, Cuba, Philippines, Jamaica.\n\nBut I get it. You don’t want to admit it. You don’t want to be a victim. You think feminism is a dirty word. You think it’s not classy to fight for equality. You hate the word pussy. Unless of course you use it to call a man who isn’t up to your standard of manhood. You know the type of man that “allows” “his” woman to do whatever she damn well pleases. I get it. You believe feminists are emotional, irrational, unreasonable. Why aren’t women just satisfied with their lives, right? You get what you get and you don’t get upset, right?\n\nI get it. You want to feel empowered. You don’t want to believe you’re oppressed. Because that would mean you are indeed a “second-class citizen.” You don’t want to feel like one. I get it. But don’t worry. I will walk for you. I will walk for your daughter. And your daughter’s daughter. And maybe you will still believe the world did not change. You will believe you’ve always had the rights you have today. And that’s okay. Because women who actually care and support other women don’t care what you think about them. They care about their future and the future of the women who come after them.\n\nOpen your eyes. Open them wide. Because I’m here to tell you, along with millions of other women that you are not equal. Our equality is an illusion. A feel-good sleight of hand. A trick of the mind. I’m sorry to tell you, but you are not equal. And neither are your daughters.\n\nBut don’t worry. We will walk for you. We will fight for you. We will stand up for you. And one day you will actually be equal, instead of just feeling like you are.\"\n\n\n------------------------\n\n\nMy reply: \n\n\nI think you misunderstand the concept of \"equality\". \n\nEquality means that nobody is inherently considered to be better than someone else because of superficial qualities. It means that we have laws to prevent someone from using those superficial qualities as a basis for making decisions regarding opportunity. \n\nLet's examine your complaints one by one:\n\nYou list over a dozen women who should be thanked for fighting for the rights that women have today. Which, is all the same rights as men have (plus a few more). \nThen you double back and say basically that you can pretend that you have equal rights, but you're a fool denying all the work done by those before you.  So...  look more closely at that. The *ACCOMPLISHMENTS* of those women are what earned you equal rights. Yes. Say THANK YOU. Say it often and mean it, because you have equal rights. today. right now. You do. \n\nImmediately you plummet into the wage gap myth. Let's use some tired cliche' obvious answers of why this is stupid. \n1. If I could pay a team of primarily women approx. 75% of what I would pay an equivalent group of men, why would I not hire primarily women and save up to 25% on my largest expense as a business owner, human resources?\n2. The differences in pay between men and women in the sighted fields is normally on the level of 5 or 6 cents to the dollar. an amount easily attributed to a variety of things, but certainly not solely determined by sexism. I'll grant you that it is possible it is a factor, but if I were a betting man I'd wager an argument could be made to show sexism acounts for less than 1% of the discrepancy. \n3. Let's factor in the wages paid for jobs likely to harm or kill you. An industry happily left to men, who make up over 95% of workplace deaths. This means that jobs likely to harm or kill you are likely at least 90% men. Meaning that when you have no education, and you need to make good money, risking your life will earn you more money. Add to this the understanding that girls and women graduate high school and college in greater numbers than boys and men. \n4. young childless women, in their mid 20s, are out-earning their male counterparts. \n\nWomen aren't treated poorly in the workplace as a commonality. They gravitate towards different fields of work. There are anti discrimination laws, if someone is violating those laws, report them. use social media, expose them. Believe me, the world is watching, and very few of them would want to miss out on a chance to support a woman fighting oppression.\n\nYou go on to complain about men discussing your uterus, and your body...  So, what you mean is that men elected by a population of voters made up of men and women, where at least half don't vote, decide details of laws surrounding abortion and reproductive rights. \nCurrently you have the federal right to seek an abortion. You have literally hundreds of birth control options, ranging from hormonal daily pills, to semi monthly injections, implants, non-hormonal options...  etc. Many/most of these options are covered by health care, by law. Men have one option: condoms. Besides condoms men are told to either accept the risk of sex, or not have it at all. \nIf I meet a girl, she says \"I'm on birth control injections, and I would abort as soon as I found out if something happened anyway, I'm totally not interested in having kids at this point in my life.\". We have sex that night. we see each other another few times, and it kinda fizzles out. 4 weeks later she calls me and says \"I'm pregnant, and I know I said I would abort but I'm keeping it. It's yours\", you have no choice in the matter. You are now legally accountable for that kid for 18 years. \nIf you put that sort of lack of choice upon women, suddenly it sounds like the worst thing ever. Imagine, if a man could say \"fuck no, you're having this child, I'll take custody, and you pay me monthly to raise it, I know I agreed that abortion was what we would do if birth control failed, but I actually want a kid now, so you'll have it and I'll take it, and you help pay for it, and you can see it on weekends if you want.\"  no. If you said \"Well if you don't like the concept of being forced to have a child if you get pregnant, then don't have sex\".  This is literally the choice men have. We can trust a woman at her word, and then she can change her mind and we are legally responsible for that kid. This is not equality, not at all. when the suggestion of the \"financial abortion\" is made, that a man can tell a woman \"I will not raise a child with you, I am opting out legally from raising this child or ever having a right to be in this child's life\" you have to release that man from being a legal parent. This would have to occur within a time frame during pregnancy the same as a biological abortion. This allows women their choice of being single parents, or aborting in the case that they decided to keep an accidental pregnancy. This allows men to be held to their word, as well as women to be held to theirs. This allows equality of choice, and reproductive rights.  \nI also wonder where feminism is on helping to promote Vasalgel, which would greatly reduce the rate of accidental pregnancy in the first place, and give men a powerful option for birth control methods, putting them a step closer to women in terms of this right. \n\nTaxes on \"basic sanitary needs\".  you are talking about equality to men, right? we pay taxes on our basic sanitary needs all the time. razors and toilet paper and tissues, and talcum powders, and deoderants...  of course we pay taxes on those items. If you have a complaint that items like sanitary goods shouldnt be taxed, that is fine, I probably would support that. But I don't see how you believe that is an issue of inequality to men. \n\nThe letter talks after this about having to \"justify their actions after a man forces himself on them\" right. you have to recount exactly how it happened to the police, who will investigate the incident. You have to explain to police when there is a potential element of consent involved that you had clearly communicated you were not consenting, and how you did that. So the police will ask you detailed questions all about the incident so they can do their job as best as possible. You giving a strong account of an event will help your case. the police are trying to help you.  this is not inequality. If I am attacked by someone, and I break their nose and jaw defending myself, and yet I'm untouched claiming to have been attacked, I'm going to have some detailed explanations to make, aren't I? and here I am the victim, being interrogated!? Yes. Because your story is a very important element of the incident. \n\nYou follow this by mentioning that women don't have paid maternity leave. Do men have paid paternity leave? \nOh...  women in other countries have it, gotcha, Because this was supposed to be about how you're not equal to men, wasn't it? Sure, work to get paid maternity leave, work to get all the things you believe would improve out society. But don't claim it is a factor of inequality. Because it's just something you want the government to regulate about business, and you cannot simply stuff socialist concepts down people's throat without a spoonfull of oppression to make it slide down a little easier. This again is not an inequality, and I've yet to see an actual right you lack that men have. \n\nThe next topic is breastfeeding. I don't really know if there are any laws preventing this, but I'm fairly sure that most laws allow for it, making an exclusion to indecency laws for breastfeeding in public. I think people who give others a hard time for this are shitty people. It isn't something men do though, so it's not an inequality, it's also (to my knowledge) not regulated as being illegal. So it's mainly social pressure and commentary that is being complained about. Again, not a right being denied to women that is granted to men. If women want to urge the law to let them be topless as it does in various parts of the country, go for it. Just don't expect men to stop looking at tittys. That's never going to happen. \n\nThe next part discusses social pressures and criticisms of things like appearance and then references being judged for the brand of high end hand bag she carries rather than her degree.....  by who? BY WHO!? I don't know any men who would know the brand of the handbag, but they might judge you by your degree. A degree she is more likely to have than a man, on average, by the way.  You are judged differently from men on your appearance? probably. But if you believe men aren't objectified you're crazy. If you think men aren't catcalled you're crazy. You simply can't see what your feminist lenses filter out. This is not inequality. There is no law that can prevent how people see other people. and your depiction of judgement for the high end handbag over the college degree just stinks of your inability to see just how insane your privilege theory really is. \n\nNext up is spousal abuse and rape, followed by the privilege stack listing off people worse off than white men.  Let's take them one at a time. The deluth model makes sure men are arrested when they are the abused. The lack of men's shelters helps to ensure that there are no resources for men to get themselves and their children out of abusive homes. If they go to the CPS, they may lose their children all together, because of the lack of understanding of abused men in our society. You ignore half of the abuse sufferers because of their gender, and act like women are the ones who are invisible. Just google \"men's shelter closes\" and read.  That's feminism. that's your equality. You want to know a little nugget of info that should help you understand how much you don't understand this situation? Lesbian couples have the highest rates of spousal abuse. \n\nFollowing this you compare the USA to various other nations. \n\nSingapore, Estonia, Iceland, New Zealand. You understand that your request for equality is all over the map, you want to have the benefits of socialist systems for yourself, but you also idolize what some of the least diverse nations on the planet are able to do by being a strongly nationalist society. They have some of the most strict immigration laws in the world, while america remains to have one of the most permissive. None of this has any bearing on your equality to American men. \n\nThe next paragraph essentially creates a straw man out of the sort of person who would claim to be on equal footing to men in America. The author essentially paints a picture of a woman who says she isn't a victim, and doesn't see the world through the feminist lens. Then scoffs at this straw man, claiming she get's it. It's because these sort of women cannot bear to understand their victimized place in society, that these women who don't walk around feeling the victimhood of womanhood are simply too weak to handle the realities of our world, and their place in it. The existence of successful women, and the individuals who are doing well in life are tossed aside, with the explanation that just because a woman can make patriarchy work for her doesn't mean she isn't still oppressed... Right. It's amazing how the writer of this article can start off the list thanking all those who won her the equal rights she enjoys today, turn around and deny the equal rights she has, and then list off a bunch of factors that have nothing to do with equality, simply are issues feminism/some women have with modern society or government policy in America. Though not one can be held up as a right other citizens have that they are denied. Not one can be listed as a \"human right\" and not one can be looked at as anything more than a first world complaint when compared to what women around the world deal with. \n\nShe ends the list having never sighted one thing men have that women don't, but that she will keep fighting to make she she gets those equal rights, because even though you might feel equal in your life, you really aren't because you're eyes aren't opened, and focused through the feminist lens to see how horribly you have it.  \n\n\nHere is a list of rights women have that men do not: \n\nWomen are able to register to vote without a social contract of selective military service. Men may not register to vote without selective service registration. Failure to register for the selective service may result in fines or jail time. \n\nWomen have the only legal control grated over reproductive rights. Men have the option to use birth control or abstain from sex in order to control their reproductive rights. \n\nWomen in the USA aren't allowed to have part of their genitals removed at birth. Male genital mutilation is considered normal in the USA.\n\nIn several states, men cannot be \"raped\" by a woman. Rape is only considered to be penetrated, but being forced to penetrate is not called rape. Further, you'll notice when a little boy is raped by a woman, they call it an affair, or sex, but not rape. \n\nAnway, that's about it. Legally we are pretty much on equal ground. So when you discuss the issues, call it what it is. You are fighting for womens rights, and women's issues. But not equality. You thanked the women in the first part of your letter who gave you that. Maybe stop shitting all over their work by claiming it didn't accomplish all that it has. You have all the legal rights of men in your nation, and then some.",

    "text": "Advice for new teachers Good morning!\n\nI've only lurked on this sub for a few months, but I've noticed a huge influx of first time teachers (which I assume is common around this time of year) so, first of all, congratulations! Teaching is incredible. It's fun, it (can be) rewarding, but there are some scary parts to it. So much so that [8% of teachers quit per year](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/24/495186021/what-are-the-main-reasons-teachers-call-it-quits), which is alarmingly high, but even worse is that [4 in 10 new teachers quit within the first year](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit-within-a-year). Yikes.\n\nNow there's many reasons for that, but a lot of it (my opinion) comes from ignorance to the profession. So to help combat that, I'm going to laundry list a bunch of random tips/suggestions/things in no particular order that helped me my first year or so, and if anyone else feels so inclined to add to this, please do so.\n\nDISCLAIMER: my suggestions apply to mainly high and possibly middle. Some of my suggestions might be the polar opposite for elementary; I can't speak on grades 1-5. \n\n* Teaching is a balance of combining your personality, strengths, and style with what has already been proven to work. Don't try and reinvent the wheel; you're not the first person to ever step in a classroom, but at the same time don't just run to your Classroom Management textbook from your Sophmore year of college every time little Timmy rolls his eyes. \n* Your school should have a mentoring program of sorts, if not, find someone in your department that you can basically follow around like a hawk. Find someone that's approachable and good with the kids - you'll be able to tell from the first time you talk to them. Trust me. Try to not find someone that is jaded, which depending on the school/district, that'll be very hard to do. Mimic that person to a tee. You'll find that some of the stuff he/she does is great for you while others you can do without. No two classes are the same. You could be teaching American History and the teacher across the hall which is doing the exact same unit as you with the exact same assessments, but it'll be ran differently. Find what works for you. \n* Don't do the same things two years in a row. I don't mean curriculum (though you'll definitely be tweaking that for the first few years), but rather the way you approach it. Find what work and what doesn't. You may find that you don't like some of the things that the teacher with 30 years experience does. That's okay.  \n* Be willing to drop whatever isn't working. It sucks when you spend all weekend working on a lesson plan only to realize that it didn't at all come out the way you intended. Always have a fallback.\n* Learn to read the students' body language. I don't care if you have the most well-behaved, disciplined, AP students. If you see a sea of glossed over eyes, you've lost them. Stop and move on to something else (especially applicable to those of you who are teaching in 90 minute periods).\n* Whatever grade you teach, talk to them two grades higher. I teach freshmen and juniors English honors and I have the same spiel every year. For my juniors it's that they're two years away from sitting in a college classroom, so they need to act like adults. For my freshman I semi-unintentionally scare them with my \"this is an honors level class, and I expect honors level behavior and effort. If you cannot do that, then go to guidance now and switch to a regular level class.\" That causes them to perk up. My logic is that high schoolers are either of age to drive or about to be, and if the US says that they are old enough to drive a giant piece of metal on a highway going 70 mph, then they are mature enough to do what is asked of them.\n* Don't take their opinions of you personally. They're going to be varied. I had a kid tell me that I'm his favorite teacher he's ever had while the student right next to him absolutely hated me. It'll happen. No sweat. In this regard, treat teaching like a normal job. If you focus on trying to get them all to like you, then you're going to have a bad time.\n* Treat them like adults until they act like a child.\n* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CREATE A RULE THAT YOU DON'T INTEND ON ENFORCING! I made this mistake my first year. Kids will test you. If you stupidly put a dumb rule in your syllabus, you're stuck with it for the whole year. \n* Speaking of syllabus, if your school allows you to tweak it, I like to ask for parent's e-mail, cell-phone, and also which method of contact that they prefer (I've had it bite me before in parent meetings when they said I called but should have e-mailed or vice versa).\n* Hope you like tape. This job has more red tape and bureaucracy than I ever would have imagined - which brings me to my next point...\n* CYA. Document every single little thing that you can imagine, especially behavior issues. You don't want to be sitting in a parent conference with the principal in March and not have anything to back up what you've been saying (as a side note, this is another reason why I prefer e-mail over phonecalls with parents). Literally document everything. \"On 10/3 at 11:38 AM, Timmy took out his cell phone. Received verbal warning. 10/4 11:00 AM Timmy took out phone. Issued detention. Called home on 10/4 at 3:00 P. No answer. Left voicemail detailing incident. Sent email on 10/4 at 3:15 P. E-mail attached.\" Is it a pain? Yes. But it is so necessary, and nothing shuts up the \"my child is an angel and would never do that\" parent quicker than that.\n* Be available to kids. You'll get a few that latch on to you. I had a few that came to me for tutoring during lunch and it turned into a mini counseling sessions with things they were struggling with school wise and friends.\n* But be careful. Remember that you are required by law to report any signs of abuse or any indication of self-harm.\n* Be respectful of other teachers. For some reason students think that it's okay to berate other teachers to the \"cool\" teachers. Don't allow them to do that. Cut it off immediately. You may share their opinion, but remember the classroom isn't a place for gossip. You are their instructor. They'll respect that.\n* Enjoy what you teach. I mean, this should be a very \"duh\" point, but you will be amazed at how many experienced teachers hate their subject. Yes, there's going to be parts of it you don't like, and that's okay, but whatever you don't like, multiply that by 50. That's how your kids feel.\n* But the flip side of that is things you are enthusiastic about goes over so much better than things you're indifferent. I'm one of the few out there that still loves teaching \"The Scarlet Letter\" and the vast majority of my kids like it too because of how we approach the text.\n* Remember where you are. You may love what you're teaching, but the kid in front of you might hate every single thing about your subject. Think back to your least liked subject in school and how you felt about it. Now realize that in every period there's a few of those kids sitting there.\n* 504's are not an excuse to be lazy (NOTE: I have no idea what 504/IEP's are called in other states. They might be the same thing. I can only speak for Florida). Some students will have accommodations whether they're ELL or something else. You have zero authority to override an IEP/504 (note that you will have a meeting with guidance and you will be able to give your input about accommodations per student, but in the classroom, you have to go by whatever they need). The brutal reality is that some students manipulate the system. In Florida it's incredibly easy to get accommodations. The most common one is extended time. That's not just on quizzes/tests. That's for homework/papers/projects/anything. You could inevitably have a student who waits until the bitter end to turn in everything. A 504 IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE LAZY! But it's tricky. Sometimes you cannot enforce a strict deadline. This is where communication with the parent and guidance is paramount as well as documentation.\n* Be very aware of what else is going on in school and be sympathetic to it. For example, I know a lot of my students are in AP classes, so I try to make the workload light come around April-May. I also know that a lot of them take SATs around that time, so I come up with SAT prep exercises that also align with the standards I'm teaching (something that is very easy to do with English in particular). Homecoming is next week and the kids are excited? Don't assign a weekend project. Things like that. \n* Male teachers: Be very aware that you are a male. Don't find yourself alone in a classroom with any student male or female. I'll have one or two come talk to me privately for whatever reason and I do the same thing. I float by door in eyesight of anyone that could be in the hallway. Don't ever allow the door to be closed. Even if they're coming to you for something personal, explain to them that you have to keep the door open.  \n\nOkay, this turned out to be significantly longer than I had imagined. I'll update if I think of more. But if you hung in this long, that already shows you care. It's fun. It's hard. Probably harder than anything you've done before, but man, seeing the lightbulb click in the faces is awesome. It's worth it if you can stick with it.",

    "text": "I am not able to give all of my students the attention they need and deserve. Right now I work at a private charter school that deals with children with behavioral problems and emotional problems. I didn't really know what I was getting into when I applied there, just that I wanted a job my first year teaching history and that I wouldn't be getting many subbing calls in the place where I lived (Though i did have a person call the other day looking for me to sub. So it would have been a long wait). \n\nSo I took a job teaching at this school. And right now I'm in a bind because I love the people that work there and are really think full to them for their guidance but the way the school is set up their is just no way for me to give the kids what they need.\n\nRight now this is what my schedual looks like.\n\nBlock one: 72 minuites of class with two Civics students, three world history students, two 8th grade state history students, and one 7th grade world history student. And in a week we may be getting a 6th grader in the class as well.\n\nSecond block I go and teach at a different part of the school where I may get one student in class if I'm lucky and have one who everyday refuses to come point blank. And in it I have 1 American history, two world history, and two 7th grade history.\n\nThen for their block I don't get planning. Because its a charter school and because we don't have enough people to provide services (every kid has an iep) the teachers have to sub in on their planning period. So I get to help out in another class that I have no experience in.\n\nThen in fourth block its a littler easier for the moment. I have five civics students and one American history student. This is down from last week when I had that plus one world history student. \n\nAnd I just dont' have the time and ability to give everyone what they need. I wish I did, the kids deserve it and need it but usually I end up having to have some kids or groups like the NC class self teach because between managing lessons, dealing with behavior (like today when three kids decided they weren't going to do guided notes or work and just sat there. And their was nothing I could do because we don't have enough staff to send them out or do ISS so all I could do was try to convince them to work before having to move on just to cover things) and teaching I run out of time.\n\nAnd because of the fact that we use  versions of text books, limit access to the net, and that I have to prep for five different classes I can't really come up with anything to new and exciting to really make class more enjoyable or add to  my repertoire \n\nAnd this is not a school where the students will self teach at all. Classroom management is also a mess at times it seems like. Their are therapists who are in there to supposedly help with the management and help the kids do work but they are either gone most of the time or just sit there quietly. \n\n And their are other small things like not getting out due to in climate weather like the public schools do, even for snow days. \n\nBut my principal and the other teachers are supportive and that is partly what makes my decision hard. I really like them and they have given me a lot of help and I know if I leave then they will have a hard time finding a replacement ( I get the feeling their weren't very many others applying for the position when i got it). But also their is the idea of job security. The between DeVos and the new Pres who knows whats going to happen. And with the school thinking of going to semester scheduled and starting in june of this year I would have to either say no to the contract and look for a job or accept it and then break contract a month into it which seems wrong to me and I would imagine carry repercussions when it comes to future employment.  \n\nSo I really don't know and I don't know if anyone will even read this far. It's just something I really need to get out. I mean maybe I am stressing myself out to much. Maybe if I cared less it would  be better. I mean not having to be there untill 8 every day, getting a free lunch, and living close to where i work in a cheap neighborhood are good things. But I just don't know if I can do it a second year. The school is thinking about not offering as many classes next year so that may help things but I'm not sure if it will happen.",

    "text": "Old Dog New Tricks: Professional Development Ideas? After receiving my Masters of Education in the mid-90's, I worked briefly in the United States teaching Middle School and then for a year in Canada working as a Learning Resource Teacher.\n\nDuring this period of time, I finished a second (academic) Masters degree and after being laid off at my public school teaching job, I decided to move overseas and teach English in Asia. \n\nThat I had a large student loan to pay off also informed my decision. \n\nLife is good over here. There was / is always loads of work and in the 15+ years I've been here, I've taught everything from Kindergarten all the way up to University. \n\nThe money is good (by North American standards) and the cost of living is low. \n\nNow that I have a family and children of my own, I am trying to get into the International School system as a teacher. Besides career advancement, I would like also to eventually transition my own children from the local public school system into an international school so that I can eventually send them to University in Canada.  \n\nDespite having more than 20 years experience as a teacher - during my last interview de-brief, the principal mentioned that I have very little professional development over last 15 years. \n\nHe was completely right. \n\nI was applying for a Grade 5 position and the principal mentioned that he would have liked to see me come into the interview with programming / instructional knowledge and experience of 'Readers / Writer's Workshop' and 'Responsive Classroom'. These were two of the examples he mentioned, I imagine there were others he could have pointed to as well. The principal mentioned that he liked me, the things I said, my experience and passion for teaching but that other candidates coming directly from public school or international school jobs had more professional development and up-to-date knowledge of instructional programming and practice than I did.  \n\nQuestion: What professional development courses could I take that would put me in a good position to be a better candidate during the next round of interviews?\n\nAny course I would take would have to be available online and -while it might be possible to organize classroom demonstrations for the purposes of evaluation, it would be a bit hard to organize given local resources. \n\nThanks for tolerating the long-winded question. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "What can my mom do? Alright Reddit.. I've had several throwaways and small accounts, but I've never actually posted before. I'm really banking on some helpful advice here. \n\nMy mom graduated from college with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology, but she stayed home with my siblings and I while we were really young. When we were kids, she went back to school to obtain a Master's Degree in Science Education, and she started teaching high school Chemistry. She taught at her first school for a few years, but her contract wasn't renewed because she had run afoul of the head principal (not giving school board member's children grades they didn't deserve, not passing star athletes who didn't put in the work, and disciplining a girl for acting belligerent and skipping class, who in turn went to said principal and accused my mother of being racist and only disliking her because she was African American). \n\nShe found a new job for the next school year at a smaller school district teaching Advanced Biology and Environmental Science, and even though it was a smaller school (the previous high school had been a huge intercity school) her salary went up by about 10k per year. She taught there for 1 full year, and is in her second year at this high school. \n\nHowever, yesterday she was told that because the school can't pass a levy (it's a very small blue collar area who doesn't value education too much) her and a few other newer teachers are being let go and absorbed for the following year. She is still getting payed through the summer, and she's going to finish up the year, but she won't have a job after that. \n\nWe're not going to be without an income as my dad is a police officer and I'm moving out of my parents house when college is finished, but my question is what are her options? \n\nShe put so much into teaching and loves making a difference in her kids' lives, and she's a very good teacher. She's just tired of looking for a new job every couple of years, and anyone who is a teacher knows how hard jobs are to come by. She is a very smart woman, but she doesn't know what else she can do besides teaching. \n\nIs there any type of profession that those degrees can matter in besides teaching? I'm not sure what else to ask but if you guys could take a second and give whatever advice you have, no matter how small. I just want my mom to be happy and I feel bad that she keeps getting screwed by the education system. \n\nI appreciate everything you guys have to offer.",

    "text": "ELLA - independent short film about Asian Americans in the midwest! Hey, my name is Douglas Kim, I'm a writer/producer living in Los Angeles.\n\nI'm producing a short film of a coming of age story that takes place in small town America.  The film follows the unlikely bond between Abe, a high school recluse and Ella, a charismatic college dropout, as they navigate the streets and social groups of their community.\n\nThe film features a notable Asian TV actor (Nichole Bloom of NBC's \"Superstore\"), offers a new setting for an Asian American story, and follows Asian characters who are integrated in their community, going through universal struggles while dealing with their outsider status in subtle but real ways.\n\nThe film will use an experimental, one-of-a-kind, camera rig that allows for a digital IMAX image.\n\nWith the success of Moonlight and other independent films, it's my belief that film is the way Asian Americans become normalized in America, where we can be seen as Americans pursuing our own version of the American dream.  I think we can accomplish that and more with our film.\n\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid\n\nWould love it if you can support and share our vision!\n\n\nmore from the director, Dan Chen:\n\nNichole Bloom and Dan Chen have been friends since they attended USC. After Nichole’s successful climb into American television, and Dan’s online awards for his short films (danchen.co), the two decided to collaborate once more on a character-driven project with the intention of festival recognition, online release, and a proof-of-concept for universal Asian American stories.\n\nDan, on the film’s story: “The underlying theme is one of “selling out,” as Abe distances himself from Ella to fit in with new kids he’s met. As an outsider, can he only fit in by submitting to the dominant views of his peers? Or is there a way he can stay loyal to his loved ones, without being left out of the larger community? The film’s story is character-driven and specific, but acts as a metaphor for the Asian American experience. Do we stay in our place, assimilate, or somehow find a third way of being?”\n\nThe camera rig was built by cinematographer Philips Shum, who has shot music videos featuring Diddy, Schoolboy Q, and Drake. It uses the principal of 35mm lens adapters, while increasing the size to accommodate a 56mm x 56mm frame, to create a low-budget solution for an IMAX field of view.\n\nElla is to be produced by Eric Cook and Douglas Kim with Evidence Films, Varient Entertainment, and Justice Tech Industries attached.",

    "text": "\"I was a feminist until my father was murdered by that woman\": Colombian woman speaks out against feminist double standard when it comes to partner homicide In Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), [Jesus Martínez was stabbed to death](https://www.elheraldo.co/bolivar/fallece-hombre-por-heridas-de-arma-blanca-en-un-motel-en-cartagena-333831) after having a discussion with Ana Margarita Rocha in a hotel. According to the woman, who left the hotel room covered in blood and with wounds on her hands and legs, her partner tried to assassinate her. After he regretted attacking her, the man ended his life by stabbing himself in the chest twice.\n\nHowever, the subsequent investigation concluded that the incident was not a suicide, but a murder and Ana Margarita Rocha has been detained as the principal suspect. According to Kelly Martínez Zuluaga, the victim's daughter, Ana Margarita's obsession with her father was such that on one occasion they argued for the same reason, since she was looking for him all day and demanded to know where he was. She also said that her father's Facebook account was allegedly hacked by Rocha. *\"She became a friend of mine when we started studying at the [National Service of Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Service_of_Learning), but she intended to approach me because she wanted to know everything my father was doing and where he was\"*, she said.\n\nKelly said that after what happened, she has not received support from the people and assured that society is very feminist, because there haven't been marches asking for justice for her father, [unlike what happened when a woman was beaten and abused by a taxi driver](http://www.eluniversal.com.co/cartagena/hoy-gran-marcha-para-pedir-justicia-por-caso-de-jasmin-alvarez-romero-245362). [***\"I was a feminist until that woman killed my dad\"***](http://www.aldia.co/mundo-serio/hablo-kelly-martinez-la-hija-del-hombre-que-murio-de-manera-sangrienta-en-un-motel), said Kelly Martinez, who believes that if the genders were reversed in this case, feminists would have been marching and asking for a court ruling.\n\nIn order to understand Kelly's disappointment with feminism, we have to take into consideration that one of the main focus of Latin American feminists is femicide. Just like North American feminists are obsessed with rape, Latin American feminists are obsessed with femicide, which is defined as the murder of a woman by her husband, boyfriend or lover. Although the vast majority of homicide victims in Latin America are men, [feminists have organized massive protests under the banner of #NiUnaMenos (Not One Woman Less)](http://nacla.org/news/2016/11/01/niunamenos-not-one-woman-less-not-one-more-death).",

    "text": "How the Ford Foundation Created Women's Studies [link](http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readarticle.aspx?artid=14085)\n\n>Women’s Studies professor and feminist author Susan M. Hartmann credits the Ford Foundation with being a substantive force that created the feminist movement. In fact, Ford’s support of women’s studies and feminist causes is so extensive that it cannot be summarized in an article of this length. The subject is ripe for a full-length book. It is safe to say that without the Ford Foundation, feminism would not have been successful in gaining such a strong foothold in academia, and by extension, politics.  \n\nSee also: [The Ford Foundation and the CIA: A documented case of philanthropic collaboration](http://transmissionsmedia.com/the-ford-foundation-and-the-cia-a-documented-case-of-philanthropic-collaboration/).  \n\n>The CIA uses philanthropic foundations as the most effective conduit to channel large sums of money to Agency projects without alerting the recipients to their source. From the early 1950s to the present the CIA’s intrusion into the foundation field was and is huge. A U.S. Congressional investigation in 1976 revealed that nearly 50% of the 700 grants in the field of international activities by the principal foundations were funded by the CIA (Who Paid the Piper? The CIA and the Cultural Cold War, Frances Stonor Saunders, Granta Books, 1999, pp. 134-135). The CIA considers foundations such as Ford “The best and most plausible kind of funding cover” (Ibid, p. 135). The collaboration of respectable and prestigious foundations, according to one former CIA operative, allowed the Agency to fund “a seemingly limitless range of covert action programs affecting youth groups, labor unions, universities, publishing houses and other private institutions” (p. 135). The latter included “human rights” groups beginning in the 1950s to the present. One of the most important “private foundations” collaborating with the CIA over a significant span of time in major projects in the cultural Cold War is the Ford Foundation.\n\nEdit: someone rightly took issue with the website on which the above was published (contains some questionable links on the side bar).  So here's the CIA itself discussing the same issues, in a somewhat humorously defensive tone: \n\nhttps://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol46no1/article08.html\n\nThe data comes not from the website but from the book by academic Frances Stonor Saunders, a British historian, as well as congressional investigations.    To repeat: there is no doubt, none, nada, that CIA has used philanthropic foundations throughout its history.   The same essay was published on other [sites](https://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/FordFandCIA.html) as well.   \n\nFor those still skeptical, go to 26.32 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CFLpZcY3ss) documentary and you'll find an actual News report by CBS from the 1970's describing the scandal of CIA using philanthropic organizations as fronts.\n\nThis is not a \"conspiracy theory\".   It is part of the documented historical record.   \n\nIn Orwell's 1984, dissident groups (represented by Emmanual Goldstein) are actually controlled by the party.   By the same token, capitalist \"philanthropic\" foundations have long attempted to steer the left in certain directions -- specifically, away from class analysis and toward identity politics and postmodernism.   Feminism is their greatest triumph.   \n\nIt's ironic that so many people blame Marx for feminism, considering that the entire purpose of funding gender and ethnic studies was to reduce the focus on class.  \n\n>\"The Women's Liberation Movement may be considered as subversive to the New Left and revolutionary movements as they have proven to be a divisive and factionalizing factor.... It could be well recommended as a counterintelligence movement to weaken the revolutionary movement.\" This was from an August, 1969 report by the head of the San Francisco FBI office.[4] Within several years, the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations were pumping millions into women's studies programs on campus.\n\nOnce again I have to stress that this is not a \"conspiracy\" since it was done out in the open, although to the extent that CIA used these foundations to disguise their involvement in domestic politics, I suppose it may qualify.   Certainly the CIA's funding of Gloria Steinem and Ms. Magazine was illegal, since CIA is prohibited from engaging in domestic counter-intelligence operations.   \n\nThere are two possibilities here: one is that the great capitalists are just really enamored with feminism.   So much so that they bankrolled the certifiable nutcase Sally Miller Gearhart, founder of the first gender studies class and promoter of male genocide.  \n\nThe other possibility is that elites aren't quite as dumb and incompetent as many assume.  They recognized the gender war as an ideal way of neutering the left by dividing and conquering the working class.   Whether by design or accident or a little of both, they have succeeded.   Pseudo-\"leftists\" today talk almost exclusively about identity politics; they alienate the white male majority by labeling them privileged oppressors; and the traditional American left -- which focussed on anti-war activism, civil rights, free speech and above all class issues -- is all but dead.",

    "text": "I resigned from my part-time retail job, hoping I made the right decision Backstory: Ever since graduating high school I knew I would have to find a part-time job to work in order to pay for tuition and cover other expenses since my parents couldn't afford to do so. I got a job working for one of the most famous American fashion designer brands as a sales associate and was happily employed there for the most part. Until 2.5 years later my store was closed and I was laid off, with a generous severance package thankfully. I told myself I didn't want to do retail anymore, at least not in a large store where I was only gonna be treated as well as my sales were.\n\nAfter being laid off I was unemployed for only about a month, before finding a new job. That month of unemployment was very productive for me, all in all, I went on 12 interviews and landed 3 positions. When it was all said and done I decided to work in a small boutique retail showroom, inside of the company's corporate office. As a result, I got access to all the perks all the actual corporate employees did and got to see what office life was really like, all while technically still working retail. After 6 months of working there I still do really love the brand and loved my job, but ultimately lack of support from my manager and a series of condescending remarks from my coworker's about my job performance made me have second thoughts.\n\nOver the summer my family was blessed with inheriting a sizeable amount of money from a relative who passed. My family promised me they would contribute part of that money to paying off my undergrad and graduate degree. Despite knowing that I didn't have to work anymore I still chose to do so. But after more frequent bitter moments at work and a new opportunity on the horizon, I thought about why I started working retail in the first place.\n\nWith the holiday weekend now being over and having served my part, I officially submitted my resignation email. A lengthy two paragraphs thanking my manager for the opportunity but letting them know that I secured an internship that offered more relevant experience to my degree. Despite my gracious tone and enthusiasm towards the brand, I received a rather curt \"Thank you, please let us know when your last day will be.\" Now I'll be starting my first internship of my college career (junior year )\n\nI've never known anything but retail my whole life. I'm super anxious right now but retail isn't my career so I am hoping I did the right thing. All I know is that doing this has lit a fire under my ass. I am super ready to work hard and make sure that this career choice plays out for the better. (If you want more information about company names and more specifics feel free to private message me as I feel this post is already fairly long.)\n\nTL;DR: I finally stopped drinking the retail kool-aid, will be taking a leap of faith into my first internship, and am nervous like all fucking hell!",

    "text": "Casual racism ***** EDIT: Wow, this post got significantly more attention than I expected. Thanks for all the advice and support (and zealous arguments about when stores should and should not allow more customers inside). I will be reporting this employee, mainly because while I do believe that there was wrong on both sides (but thanks to all of you who clearly offer amazing customer service), and I should just get over it, there is something to be said about speaking out about these matters, especially when prior generations have not. Who knows if it makes a difference, but it seems to at least have sparked some discussion here. I'm not going to insist on his firing or other retribution, if they would even do so in the first place; I can totally understand if this guy had a bad day and needed to take it out on someone. But the company should know if a branch allowed an employee to scream at a customer and did not address it immediately.\n\nObviously there's a lot of overt racism in the US, and it's been at a head for a long time now. There is every day violence committed against blacks and Muslims, and the statistics are there to prove it. I'm glad we talk about that. I hope that we can also talk about how comments about one's English or consumption of domestic animals is destructive too. No need to rank racism; it's all bad. For those who asked why saying \"ni hao\" is frustrating, rude, and yes, racist--I speak English. Why are those people assuming that I don't? *****\n\n\nI apologize beforehand if this isn't the right forum, but I need a place to vent, and this subreddit has always been one of the more open ones on this site. I went home this past weekend while studying for Step 1, and my dad offered to drive me back to my apartment as I don't live too far from school. He really wanted to stop by Sam's Club to pick up some fruit for me to take back, and even though I didn't think it was worth the effort, especially since it was nearing closing time, I said okay, because it's nice when your parents want to be nice to you, you know? We got to Sam's Club literally a minute before it closed, and my dad rushed inside while I parked. I decided to just wait for him outside the doors and was standing there when the guy who checks receipts called me inside and asked me if I was with the person who had just run in. He then proceeded to berate me for my dad coming in at closing time. (Edit: I did in fact tell him we were just getting one thing, in English, for those saying I shouldn't have just walked away. But no one has time to be yelled at once you're trying to be reasonable.) I walked away because no one has time to deal with that, and as I was walking away, he said, \"Maybe if I speak your language, ni hao ni hao, you’ll understand.\" I went to the cash registers and asked for the supervisor. When I told her what had happened and what this man had said, he ran up from the doors and started screaming in my face about how I was \"lying on [him].\" He continued to yell that I was lying (honestly if I were going to lie, I would have come up something slightly more creative). The manager said he was just trying to do his job.\n\nI was so frustrated and upset, and I continue to be despite sleeping on it. My dad does not want me to report this person because my dad is a good person and at about the zenith of non-confrontational, and he doesn't think this employee should be at risk for losing his job. But for me, not saying anything feels like implicitly condoning this behavior. Yes, we were in the wrong for entering this store at closing time--that one pack of strawberries better be the best I've ever had--but that didn’t justify outright racism and aggression. I don't know how many times I have heard \"ni hao\" as an insult/pick-up line/greeting and how many times I have been congratulated on not having an accent. I have been followed down the street and called a cunt because I told a stranger that addressing me with \"ni hao\" was impolite. I know this is something that people of color confront on a daily basis and that we are meant to speak out when it happens, but… it's hard, guys. Racism directed at Asians and Asian-Americans in particular seems like the last bastion of racism in comedy (see: Steve Harvey), the last and most insidious form of undercutting a whole group of people. It feels like no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I dedicate my professional (and whatever is left of my personal) life to trying to take care of people, how much my parents have sacrificed, that I can be leveled with the basest of insults.",

    "text": "Working with anti-feminists How do women feminists work alongside other women who are actively against feminism? How do feminists try to persuade other women who view feminism in the negative sense that it will have a positive impact in the workplace? \n\nI know I can't be the only women who is frustrated with other women in their workplace. So many college educated white women voted for Trump and that set of ideals as did the feminists who voted for Hillary. It's been difficult for me to create and encourage a \"pro-women\" workplace when my fellow women actively work against it, even if they're working against themselves. I feel stuck and outnumbered. I've created a pocket of employees who practice the same ideas and cooperation and our results have been overwhelmingly positive, but my other female peers reject and ridicule the model, despite their practices leading to negative results. It only leads to us all doing more work, higher work stress and a toxic atmosphere.\n\nTo give a clearer picture:\n\nI live in a red (almost) southern state and work as a retail manager. Like most retail locations, my store employees and peers consists of mostly of women between the ages of 16-50. I don't want to get too specific of my company, but my store is a common retailer you would find in any middle American mall, and fortunately they have an inclusive, empowering marketing stance. I specifically direct one of their sister brands that promotes a positive body image and celebrates all shapes and sizes of women. I hire young women who also believe in and promote a genuineness among women. I'm a young(er) manager as well, but have worked in retail long enough to know the pro's and cons of bad managers, and I've vowed never to be one of the \"bad bosses\" I had while I was working my way up the ladder. I have also taken it on myself to help advance these younger women as best as I can. I find ways to work around their school and lifestyle schedules so they can both enjoy their college years (and beyond) while also get a paycheck that supports their needs. I coach them through situations, both professional and outside of work. I hire them at an advanced rate, find ways to get them a raise and try to promote them into positions they're naturally suited for. I encourage teamwork and cooperation among each other and praise their strengths and use their weaknesses only as teachable opportunities, not against them. As a result of empowering my employees, my business results speak for themselves. The part of the business I am directly responsible for is in the green, while the rest of the store is in the red. I have very low turnover, and hardly ever have \"drama\" that I must mediate. Our projects are completed on time and my girls are often called on by the rest of the store to help with their responsibilities. I love my girls, am proud of them as individuals and they've grown close despite their differences and different ages. \n\nWhile I am directly responsible of one section of my store, I share responsibility of the other sections with my other managers who are also women. They don't have the same outlook on our employees, an are often catty with each other (and myself). On a few occasions, I've caught them purposefully acting against my section of the store or neglecting their responsibilities if I am not present. There's always unnecessary turmoil, high turnover, and complaints from employees. Numbers speak volumes in retail and we're very much in the red, (which not uncommon for retail right now in this economic uncertainty and a consumer movement towards \"less is more\") yet because of the stores poor performance certain factors have started to take place which makes all of our jobs harder in various ways.\n\nIn the past year, my direct supervisor, the store manager, noticed the positive difference my efforts were making and since then, she's been on board and encouraging, but we both feel like we're fighting an uphill battle with the rest of our peers. I've tried being encouraging and helpful of my fellow managers, vulnerable and likable, but I never receive compliments or encouragement back. They take advantage of my help and thats the end of us working together. It's gotten to the point where I feel sick if I'm scheduled to lead the other portion of the store, and where I keep to myself unless I'm around my employees. I feel like a robot half of my workweek, and its gotten worse since the election (I was a  vocal supporter of Hillary, and have faced a few situations since then where I was threatened to keep my opinions to myself despite other women being vocal about their Trump support.) \n\nI am sure I am not alone in this, but I'm not willing to give up the fight nor am I able to transfer my locations or switch to another job (and I'll be damned if I let Trump supporters run me away from my success).\n\nTL;DR: How does a feminist to work alongside other women who are actively anti-feminist in order to accomplish a common goal? How can you help persuade said anti-feminists that it would be in their best interest to accept feminism and practice it?",

    "text": "Data behind ACLS guidelines for medicines From time to time (but certainly no less than weekly, with the last one being [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6hi5ya/not_medical_advice_1mg_epinephrine_ivp_during/?ref=share&ref_source=link)) threads pop up where the ACLS guidelines come into play. Sometimes because someone didn't follow them, sometimes because someone claimed they were followed the wrong way.\n\nWe rarely discuss why we have the guidelines we have, and never if this constitutes the standard of care, if it is evidence based guidelines or if it is a list of what some people think you should do.\n\nThe latter is true, and it is actually based on animal studies during the 60ies, namely [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from asphyxia.* JAMA. 1962 Oct 20;182:283-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13973494/) and [Redding JS, Pearson JW. *Resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation. Drug therapy.* JAMA. 1968 Jan 22;203(4):255-60.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5694097/) where the second one found\n\n> Resuscitation [of dogs] was more successful when epinephrine was used than when no drug therapy or sodium bicarbonate were used. \n\n**Vasopressors**\n\nThe ACLS algorithm since at least 2009 have included adrenaline/epinephrine 1mg every 3-5 minutes. This is based on a single randomized study ([Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. *Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.* Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533) which is best summarized by their own conclusion\n\n> Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.\n\nROSC isn't the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. [Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. *Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956) which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.\n\nAnother study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per [Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. *Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.* BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638)  \nIt is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt\n> In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (>50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.\n\n**The AHA guidelines**\n\nThe ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the [AHA guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/).  They say\n> It is **reasonable to consider** administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.\n\nReasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. \n\nI would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn't follow protocol is hard for me to say. \n\n**Amiodarone**\n\nThere are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). \n\nThe first of these two, [Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. *Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287) found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial ([Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. *Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418) showed the same, but didn't focus on survival to hospital discharge.\n\nTherefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  \n> Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.\n\n**Edit 1.** /u/transmogrification pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, [Kudenchuk PJ et al. *Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest*. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165). This study concludes that\n\n> neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\nbut also\n\n> Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.\n\nSo there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn't support an effect larger than 3%.\n\n**Fibrinolysis**\n\nA lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don't actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn't been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see [Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. *Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.* N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151) and [Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. *Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.* Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646).\n\nIf we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).\n\n**Edit 2** As pointed out by the PEAPETT study [Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. *Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the \"PEAPETT\" study).* Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214) and /u/macreadyrj there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn't the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn't show any significant bleedings. \n\n**Sodium bicarb**\n\nThe AHA states\n> There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.\n\nAnd the study this is based at least partly on [Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. *Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest*. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643) which despite the name states\n> **The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.** However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (>15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.\n\nIt should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it's use, but routinely using it simply hasn't been shown effective as stated by the AHA\n> In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial\n\n**Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation** \n\nPer the AHA\n> However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.\n\nThere aren't any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; [Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. *Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest*. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157) and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) [Gausche M, Lewis RJ. *Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children*. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643).\n\nA more recent study in Japan [Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. *Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764) found that\n> Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.\n\nYou also have another study, [Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. *Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431) which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn't. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.\n\n**Edit 4**\nThanks to dr /u/CytokineShitStorm for pointing me to this study, [Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. *Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival*. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660) which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found\n>Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.\n\nand thus it doesn't support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn't tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient. \n\n**Summary**\nHigh quality CPR and defibrillate as soon as possible. The rest is mostly guesses.",

    "text": "Xenophobic-ish comments from a minority patient . Not sure how to feel about this. Background: I work in a city hospital that serves a very impoverished minority population . Our Institution isn't exactly stellar  , so except for Radiology and Surgery most of our residents and staff are FMGs or IMGs.  Me (FMG) and my posse ( Mostly FMGs)were doing our rounds. Being a Sunday , out team was providing cross-coverage and we had a lot of patients to round on. \n\nWe make to the ED to examine a patient who had come in with shortness of breath and  diagnosed with a PE. The patient was a black transgender patient. She had been in the ED for a couple of hours \n\nThe moment I stepped in the room my spidey-sense started tingling. Started off rough enough \" who are you ? why Are you here ? Why are  you rounding so late?.I'm short of breath\" ( while screaming at the top of her lungs).  Ma'am . I had 30 patients. i needed to prioritize , but you have my attention now . \n\nShe explained that she was basically ignored by the nurse ( which was true - was not hooked up to telemetry or SO2 monitoring ).\nI apologized to her and told her I would talk to the nurse and that she should take it up the charge nurse. So far nothing usual. \nThen she went off on a tirade  .\" My mother worked in this hospital ,I also worked in healthcare . Used to come here sometimes until I started getting my care in  *Brand name * Hospital . This hospital was  much better run when we had Real American Doctors, not all these foreign doctors.\" She repeats this stament verbatim again during the course of the encounter. \n\nNow my interns and resident are visibly disturbed. But she goes on . About how her usual hospital is much better.  I then remind her BTW, I'm also foreign ( my phenotypic  ethnicity is ambiguous- on a good day I can pass off for Hispanic/Italian . I was called \" white trash \" once ).\n\nIn order to diffuse the situation , I agree with all her comments. I  put in a few negative comments about my own hospital( I find this works very  well to calm down a an angry patient/family )  This eventually calms her down , and I manage to get a coherent history and physical exam.\n \nBy the end of the encounter I tell her \" Ma'am, I'm sorry you couldn't get a real american doctor today \". She then suddenly becomes apologetic.  \"Oh, I didn't  mean all foreign doctors are bad . Just like the cops you have good ones and bad ones  . You all have been very professional . \"\n\nI shake her hand and the encounter ends.\n\nI don't know how to feel about all this. My training tells me that the outburst was probably a reaction to the stress of being in a hospital and mistreatment by the ED nurse. She did apologize in the end ( cant vouch for the sincerity of it  though ) .

    "text": "Would this work? Billionaire Mark Cuban proposes national insurance for chronic or catastrophic issues, regular insurance for everything else I realize most doctors aren't policy makers or insurance people, but this seems like an [interesting proposal](http://blogmaverick.com/2017/03/08/some-thoughts-on-fixing-obamacare-shoot-holes-in-this-please/).\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n> Whether its Medicaid or a new program, every single person in this country should be covered 100pct for chronic physical or mental illness and for any life threatening injury.  \n\n> Everything not covered by the above can be covered by insurance sold on the Free Market, managed by the states, sold across state lines, without government interference.\n\nIs it really possible to separate out risk pools like that? It seems like [most healthcare dollars go into chronic and catastrophic issues anyway](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/insurance/cost-of-chronic-disease-1.aspx):\n\n> Chronic health problems such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, cancer and kidney disease account for more than 75 percent of the nation's $2.7 trillion in annual spending [in 2011, more like $3.2T now] for medical care, says Ursula Bauer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAccording to eSurance, health insurance for a family of four averages abut $10,000/year for an $8,000 deductible plan. There are about 125 million households in the US, with an average household size of about 2.5 persons, so that's not much more than $1 trillion. Medicare and Medicaid combined account for another $1 trillion or so. I'm not sure where the other $1 trillion comes from.\n\nHealthcare spending averaged over all Medicare recipients is about $15,000 per year, 50% higher than the average over all Americans, because Medicare recipients are mostly older of course. The average for Medicaid enrollees is about $8,000 per year, somewhat less than the national average. There are 44 million Medicare and 70 million Medicaid enrollees, so 114 million Americans, or 35% of all Americans are already covered by these two agencies.\n\nTaking all that into account, it seems like Cuban's plan could be an improvement over the current \"system\", and could be financially attractive to most people.",

Stupidly high acuity tele floor which is somehow not considered a step down despite the patient population we get. We see everything on this floor.

    "text": "Advice for new teachers Good morning!\n\nI've only lurked on this sub for a few months, but I've noticed a huge influx of first time teachers (which I assume is common around this time of year) so, first of all, congratulations! Teaching is incredible. It's fun, it (can be) rewarding, but there are some scary parts to it. So much so that [8% of teachers quit per year](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/10/24/495186021/what-are-the-main-reasons-teachers-call-it-quits), which is alarmingly high, but even worse is that [4 in 10 new teachers quit within the first year](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/mar/31/four-in-10-new-teachers-quit-within-a-year). Yikes.\n\nNow there's many reasons for that, but a lot of it (my opinion) comes from ignorance to the profession. So to help combat that, I'm going to laundry list a bunch of random tips/suggestions/things in no particular order that helped me my first year or so, and if anyone else feels so inclined to add to this, please do so.\n\nDISCLAIMER: my suggestions apply to mainly high and possibly middle. Some of my suggestions might be the polar opposite for elementary; I can't speak on grades 1-5. \n\n* Teaching is a balance of combining your personality, strengths, and style with what has already been proven to work. Don't try and reinvent the wheel; you're not the first person to ever step in a classroom, but at the same time don't just run to your Classroom Management textbook from your Sophmore year of college every time little Timmy rolls his eyes. \n* Your school should have a mentoring program of sorts, if not, find someone in your department that you can basically follow around like a hawk. Find someone that's approachable and good with the kids - you'll be able to tell from the first time you talk to them. Trust me. Try to not find someone that is jaded, which depending on the school/district, that'll be very hard to do. Mimic that person to a tee. You'll find that some of the stuff he/she does is great for you while others you can do without. No two classes are the same. You could be teaching American History and the teacher across the hall which is doing the exact same unit as you with the exact same assessments, but it'll be ran differently. Find what works for you. \n* Don't do the same things two years in a row. I don't mean curriculum (though you'll definitely be tweaking that for the first few years), but rather the way you approach it. Find what work and what doesn't. You may find that you don't like some of the things that the teacher with 30 years experience does. That's okay.  \n* Be willing to drop whatever isn't working. It sucks when you spend all weekend working on a lesson plan only to realize that it didn't at all come out the way you intended. Always have a fallback.\n* Learn to read the students' body language. I don't care if you have the most well-behaved, disciplined, AP students. If you see a sea of glossed over eyes, you've lost them. Stop and move on to something else (especially applicable to those of you who are teaching in 90 minute periods).\n* Whatever grade you teach, talk to them two grades higher. I teach freshmen and juniors English honors and I have the same spiel every year. For my juniors it's that they're two years away from sitting in a college classroom, so they need to act like adults. For my freshman I semi-unintentionally scare them with my \"this is an honors level class, and I expect honors level behavior and effort. If you cannot do that, then go to guidance now and switch to a regular level class.\" That causes them to perk up. My logic is that high schoolers are either of age to drive or about to be, and if the US says that they are old enough to drive a giant piece of metal on a highway going 70 mph, then they are mature enough to do what is asked of them.\n* Don't take their opinions of you personally. They're going to be varied. I had a kid tell me that I'm his favorite teacher he's ever had while the student right next to him absolutely hated me. It'll happen. No sweat. In this regard, treat teaching like a normal job. If you focus on trying to get them all to like you, then you're going to have a bad time.\n* Treat them like adults until they act like a child.\n* DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE CREATE A RULE THAT YOU DON'T INTEND ON ENFORCING! I made this mistake my first year. Kids will test you. If you stupidly put a dumb rule in your syllabus, you're stuck with it for the whole year. \n* Speaking of syllabus, if your school allows you to tweak it, I like to ask for parent's e-mail, cell-phone, and also which method of contact that they prefer (I've had it bite me before in parent meetings when they said I called but should have e-mailed or vice versa).\n* Hope you like tape. This job has more red tape and bureaucracy than I ever would have imagined - which brings me to my next point...\n* CYA. Document every single little thing that you can imagine, especially behavior issues. You don't want to be sitting in a parent conference with the principal in March and not have anything to back up what you've been saying (as a side note, this is another reason why I prefer e-mail over phonecalls with parents). Literally document everything. \"On 10/3 at 11:38 AM, Timmy took out his cell phone. Received verbal warning. 10/4 11:00 AM Timmy took out phone. Issued detention. Called home on 10/4 at 3:00 P. No answer. Left voicemail detailing incident. Sent email on 10/4 at 3:15 P. E-mail attached.\" Is it a pain? Yes. But it is so necessary, and nothing shuts up the \"my child is an angel and would never do that\" parent quicker than that.\n* Be available to kids. You'll get a few that latch on to you. I had a few that came to me for tutoring during lunch and it turned into a mini counseling sessions with things they were struggling with school wise and friends.\n* But be careful. Remember that you are required by law to report any signs of abuse or any indication of self-harm.\n* Be respectful of other teachers. For some reason students think that it's okay to berate other teachers to the \"cool\" teachers. Don't allow them to do that. Cut it off immediately. You may share their opinion, but remember the classroom isn't a place for gossip. You are their instructor. They'll respect that.\n* Enjoy what you teach. I mean, this should be a very \"duh\" point, but you will be amazed at how many experienced teachers hate their subject. Yes, there's going to be parts of it you don't like, and that's okay, but whatever you don't like, multiply that by 50. That's how your kids feel.\n* But the flip side of that is things you are enthusiastic about goes over so much better than things you're indifferent. I'm one of the few out there that still loves teaching \"The Scarlet Letter\" and the vast majority of my kids like it too because of how we approach the text.\n* Remember where you are. You may love what you're teaching, but the kid in front of you might hate every single thing about your subject. Think back to your least liked subject in school and how you felt about it. Now realize that in every period there's a few of those kids sitting there.\n* 504's are not an excuse to be lazy (NOTE: I have no idea what 504/IEP's are called in other states. They might be the same thing. I can only speak for Florida). Some students will have accommodations whether they're ELL or something else. You have zero authority to override an IEP/504 (note that you will have a meeting with guidance and you will be able to give your input about accommodations per student, but in the classroom, you have to go by whatever they need). The brutal reality is that some students manipulate the system. In Florida it's incredibly easy to get accommodations. The most common one is extended time. That's not just on quizzes/tests. That's for homework/papers/projects/anything. You could inevitably have a student who waits until the bitter end to turn in everything. A 504 IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BE LAZY! But it's tricky. Sometimes you cannot enforce a strict deadline. This is where communication with the parent and guidance is paramount as well as documentation.\n* Be very aware of what else is going on in school and be sympathetic to it. For example, I know a lot of my students are in AP classes, so I try to make the workload light come around April-May. I also know that a lot of them take SATs around that time, so I come up with SAT prep exercises that also align with the standards I'm teaching (something that is very easy to do with English in particular). Homecoming is next week and the kids are excited? Don't assign a weekend project. Things like that. \n* Male teachers: Be very aware that you are a male. Don't find yourself alone in a classroom with any student male or female. I'll have one or two come talk to me privately for whatever reason and I do the same thing. I float by door in eyesight of anyone that could be in the hallway. Don't ever allow the door to be closed. Even if they're coming to you for something personal, explain to them that you have to keep the door open.  \n\nOkay, this turned out to be significantly longer than I had imagined. I'll update if I think of more. But if you hung in this long, that already shows you care. It's fun. It's hard. Probably harder than anything you've done before, but man, seeing the lightbulb click in the faces is awesome. It's worth it if you can stick with it.",

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Anyone have Experience with Springboard (ELA)? Hello!\nI searched previous posts on here about College Board's Springboard program, but I'd like some more insight. My district is adopting Springboard in every ELA classroom across the county, K-12. I will be teaching American Lit for the third year in a row and feel as if I finally created a solid curriculum, but now this is being dumped on me. \n\nI went to the Springboard training about a month ago and heard my district's ELA curriculum specialists say over and over again that \"Springboard is not a program.\" ...but yeah, it's a program. \n\nDo any of you teach in a district that currently uses or has used Springboard, specifically for ELA courses? I'm curious to know what your district's requirements/expectations were in regards to its implementation. To what extent do you use the \"scripted\" lesson sequence in the book?\n\nAlso: How effective do you think the unit summative assessments are? Is the workload manageable for students? I teach in one of the top performing districts in my state, but I am also at a Title 1 school. While my students have a pretty solid background knowledge, they're still a little behind their peers on the other side of the county. \n\nAny insight anyone could provide is very much appreciated! I'm trying to go at this with a positive attitude, but I didn't become a teacher to follow a script. Thanks in advance!",

    "text": "I am not able to give all of my students the attention they need and deserve. Right now I work at a private charter school that deals with children with behavioral problems and emotional problems. I didn't really know what I was getting into when I applied there, just that I wanted a job my first year teaching history and that I wouldn't be getting many subbing calls in the place where I lived (Though i did have a person call the other day looking for me to sub. So it would have been a long wait). \n\nSo I took a job teaching at this school. And right now I'm in a bind because I love the people that work there and are really think full to them for their guidance but the way the school is set up their is just no way for me to give the kids what they need.\n\nRight now this is what my schedual looks like.\n\nBlock one: 72 minuites of class with two Civics students, three world history students, two 8th grade state history students, and one 7th grade world history student. And in a week we may be getting a 6th grader in the class as well.\n\nSecond block I go and teach at a different part of the school where I may get one student in class if I'm lucky and have one who everyday refuses to come point blank. And in it I have 1 American history, two world history, and two 7th grade history.\n\nThen for their block I don't get planning. Because its a charter school and because we don't have enough people to provide services (every kid has an iep) the teachers have to sub in on their planning period. So I get to help out in another class that I have no experience in.\n\nThen in fourth block its a littler easier for the moment. I have five civics students and one American history student. This is down from last week when I had that plus one world history student. \n\nAnd I just dont' have the time and ability to give everyone what they need. I wish I did, the kids deserve it and need it but usually I end up having to have some kids or groups like the NC class self teach because between managing lessons, dealing with behavior (like today when three kids decided they weren't going to do guided notes or work and just sat there. And their was nothing I could do because we don't have enough staff to send them out or do ISS so all I could do was try to convince them to work before having to move on just to cover things) and teaching I run out of time.\n\nAnd because of the fact that we use  versions of text books, limit access to the net, and that I have to prep for five different classes I can't really come up with anything to new and exciting to really make class more enjoyable or add to  my repertoire \n\nAnd this is not a school where the students will self teach at all. Classroom management is also a mess at times it seems like. Their are therapists who are in there to supposedly help with the management and help the kids do work but they are either gone most of the time or just sit there quietly. \n\n And their are other small things like not getting out due to in climate weather like the public schools do, even for snow days. \n\nBut my principal and the other teachers are supportive and that is partly what makes my decision hard. I really like them and they have given me a lot of help and I know if I leave then they will have a hard time finding a replacement ( I get the feeling their weren't very many others applying for the position when i got it). But also their is the idea of job security. The between DeVos and the new Pres who knows whats going to happen. And with the school thinking of going to semester scheduled and starting in june of this year I would have to either say no to the contract and look for a job or accept it and then break contract a month into it which seems wrong to me and I would imagine carry repercussions when it comes to future employment.  \n\nSo I really don't know and I don't know if anyone will even read this far. It's just something I really need to get out. I mean maybe I am stressing myself out to much. Maybe if I cared less it would  be better. I mean not having to be there untill 8 every day, getting a free lunch, and living close to where i work in a cheap neighborhood are good things. But I just don't know if I can do it a second year. The school is thinking about not offering as many classes next year so that may help things but I'm not sure if it will happen.",

    "text": "I'm almost 35 and I'm a \"job drifter\" and I'm still lost. I want to figure out what it is I should be doing with my life. Maybe this can help? Hi everyone. Fair warning, I'm not too good at \"short stories\" but I'll do my best to keep everything concise.\n\nI'm about to be 35 in a few weeks and I've been working random jobs since I was 16. I can't remember all of them but if you count having a job as collecting a paycheck (even one) from any place of employment then I have had close to or over 30 different jobs in that time span. I've worked on a farm, in grape vineyards, a bowling alley, Ponderosa, Walmart, Old Navy, Target, Home Depot, Dollar Tree, customer service call center, debt collections, a juice factory, a grocery store, a mini golf course, a gas station, a newspaper, sorted cans and bottles at a recycling center, sold expensive cutlery, worked in a group home assisting developmentally disabled individuals, worked in a pre-vocational center assisting developmentally disabled individuals, delivered in-home medical equipment for Hospice, worked in a short-term rehab for young adults struggling with substance addiction... I may be forgetting some but that's the gist. Since 2008 I've worked in human services and it's a decent fallback because the money is alright for a high school grad but it can be very stressful work and it is not something I want to do for a long time.\n\nI tried college at different times in my life. Both community colleges and both tries lasted about two semesters. I was enrolled in an art institute when I was 19 but I'm from a very small town and was thrust into a big city when I was completely not ready and came home before even attending a class.\n\nGrowing up I dreamed of being a pro football player (American) but the NFL doesn't have many places for pudgy asthmatics last I checked. Throughout high school I enjoyed art classes and acted in every high school play from grades 7-12. I was also a pretty good bowler. Yes, bowling. Hey, don't laugh, my tiny high school team (graduating class of 51) won three straight division titles against schools with graduating classes numbering in the 1000s. \n\nTowards the end of high school I began to tinker with simple graphic and website design. Have a cousin who was always very involved in that and I'd spend free periods messing with early versions of Photoshop, Microsoft FrontPage (bet no one remembers that) and teaching myself some HTML. I wanted to go to school for website design stuff but that type of career was still fairly new as the web hadn't quite yet taken off. Websites were still mainly text-based and not at all what they are today. Therefore there weren't any schools near me offering those types of courses. It was all computer science or programming and I wasn't interested in that. One community college course I took was an \"Intro to the Web\" class in which the final project was to create a three page website. I skipped the entire class and handed in my final project (a five page site with way more than required) because I had been designing and updating my high school's website since I was a junior.\n\nI do struggle with some mental stuff. Who doesn't these days? I grew up with OCD, anxiety/panic disorder and depression. I manage, as we all do. But work has always given me a great deal of trouble and I tend to think it's one of the reasons I have such a hard time holding down a job for any period of time longer than 3 years (that's my record, three whole years in one place) and I feel it interferes with my motivation and ambition... sometimes it feels like I have neither.\n\nI know we all have to work. I just want to be able to come home and tell my wife, \"Hey look at what I did today\" and not \"If I have to go back to that place one more day I'm gonna drive my car into a tree.\" It's always been very frustrating. I've had mental breakdowns in which I've missed substantial time from work because I couldn't deal with the stress and what I was feeling.\n\nMy most difficult hurdle is figuring out just what I should be doing. I feel like I'm a creative person. My mother is an artist and my father is a carpenter (although he's worked in a factory for 37 years to provide while doing carpentry stuff on the side) and they've been doing their own craft business for about 17 years now. They go to festivals and shows all over the area and recently my wife and I have been discussing getting their things on Etsy. I've also felt like perhaps I could start making some things to sell along with them and see where it goes. The trouble is, is it's an unknown entity and it's hard to just jump into something like that when you need a steady job to provide while you try to figure out how to make it work. And whenever I take on another random job I just shut down. Whatever the schedule is, on whatever days I have to work, I'm useless. I'm miserable, I don't speak to anyone, I go off on terrible rants about how bad I hate it and I basically have to talk myself out of an anxiety attack every time I get in the car to go to work. I don't wanna have to go through this anymore.\n\nA few years ago I took some SEO/blogging courses because I've always been decent at writing but I burned out on that too. A few years before that I came real close to going to a design school but a job came up that I had no choice but to take and the school didn't offer night classes so it was just back to work.\n\nI'm caught somewhere between wanting a type of career where I can be creative and something that I can run from home. Lately I've been thinking about the design school again because I've always enjoyed typography and making logos and I thought maybe I could be someone who makes invitations and cards or even posters or whatever and sell that on Etsy. The tough part is making the decision to go into debt to pay for college. Luckily my wife and I have made a pretty good life for ourselves despite my shortcomings, we always make rent, we don't starve, we drive decent cars and live in a good area and neither of us have massive amounts of college debt hanging over us.\n\nI'm just not sure what to do anymore. I'm tired of going around and around with this stuff all the time. I know not every job is cupcakes and rainbows and I get that, I just want something that doesn't fill me with complete dread every single day. I feel good about creating. I feel maybe a tiny bit of entrepreneurial sense within me... I just flip flop on a direction and my work ethic is crap. And I dunno why. Everyone I'm surrounded by has a good work ethic. I just feel so defeated and deflated by every job I've ever had to do. (If you're wondering how I keep getting so many jobs, I'm a really good interview. I've done it enough times to know exactly what they wanna hear.)  I've never felt good about any of the work I've done. It's always just been a paycheck. I don't wanna have to feel like that anymore. Is there a direction I can be pointed to? My mind changes on me more than the weather so one day it may be \"Design!\" and the next it'll be, \"Are you serious you frickin' loser? You can't do that, you suck.\" I've always been this dreamer who's always felt anything and everything is so unattainable. How do I fix that? \n\nI apologize for the novel and I thank anyone that read through it and anyone that may offer some advice. Thanks.",

    "text": "Not sure how to feel about coworkers talking in another language to the extent that it feels exclusionary. Can someone please help me understand if I am in the wrong? Hello,\nI work in a Japanese-American Company. I work with 5 other people in the same office. All of us are in the same department in an open-office environment. The assistant manager and two of the other purchasing agents speak Japanese (one from the US and one from Japan). Conversations in Japanese are very common. Until recently, the last few weeks, it has never bothered me. I have worked here for almost a year now. One of the agents and the assistant manager have been having conversations in Japanese throughout the entire day lately, and I have been finding it more and more exclusionary. I understand wanting to talk in your native language because I can speak French, but I prefer English given the choice. However, both of them have lived in the US for 20 years and are nearly as fluent in English as I am. The worst part of this is I can’t pinpoint why this has been bothering me. They have had conversations in Japanese the entire time I have worked here. A lot of their conversations in Japanese are about issues our department/company is facing, and because they don’t have these conversations in English anymore, I know far less about what is going on than I used to. I know that their conversations dip into their personal lives, and I am actually okay with this part. However, I have noticed a growing rift between the US workers who only speak English (excluding me) and the 2 Japanese employees. They have gotten to where they barely ever talk to each other, and they don’t really respect each other. The Manager of our department being one of those English speakers has made this situation even more annoying. Also, I think it has been bothering me because my own workload has been steadily increasing as theirs seems to be decreasing, according to how much they talk and not work (note:  they also pass a lot of their work to me). I mean these conversations have lasted all day (while they were in the office), and they don’t really do anything else while they talked.\nAlso, I want to show that I am not just bothered by the use of foreign languages. I have friends from several different nations, and when we get together, we talk in several different languages together.  Most of these friends speak languages I do not know, and it is fine.  For example, we’ll be having a conversation and someone will say something in Arabic, then someone will kind of explain to the non-Arabic speakers what was said if anyone seems curious. Another example, a group of Spanish and English spearkers, and French and English speakers talking in all three languages together. The Spanish and the French can be loosely understood by both groups due to similarities, so English is used when people are unsure of the exact translation or when someone wants to be sure everyone understands what they say. Two of my friends may say something to each other in their mutual language and not explain it to the group because it was an obvious aside and not really important to the whole group. Or even a work example, our department is all talking together, and there will be both Japanese and English in the conversation but everything is being explained to everyone involved. These are the sorts of situations I am used to, and I have no problems with them because everything is out in the open if need be. There may be languages being used that don’t get explained, but it isn’t something that is important. \nSo, their conversations have been distracting for a multitude of reasons, and I am not certain how I feel or how I should feel. I want to work for the UN one day, so I feel like I should learn how to just be okay with this. I also see the real affect it is having on our department. There is also the point that they are spending more and more time at work not working (and they have very important jobs). I can’t tell if I am being petty for wanting them to stop talking in Japanese as much, or if I am in the right to think that they need to work harder to try to communicate in English more often. I also can’t tell if I am just being spiteful because of the increased workload for me from doing their stuff for them. Can anyone offer any advice for this situation?",

    "text": "Hello! Looking for career advice! What path would you recommend? Hello!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI have a degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering, and 3 years and 2 months of experience in QA Software Testing. I really liked the job I did - test products that the company periodically came up with for sale, Coffee Beans, Travel and Living, I liked the products more than the actual job of testing (websites, backend entries, product flow), and I enjoyed \"client\" communications (I worked in an offshore establishment) and within the team, as compared to the technical task at hand. Especially the few \"product\" meetings that we attended, which put the developer to sleep, but I totally enjoyed sitting there, understanding the nitty-gritties that went into product development.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo I was wondering if there was some path I could take into Product development? I am currently on a sabbatical, took time off work last April to sort some personal stuff, and to think about where to go. I'm ready to come back into action, and was wondering what would be the right direction to approach this.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nShould I take a degree in Product Management? I couldn't find many on Quora apart from MBAs which a lot of people didn't recommend, quoting experience as a better candidate. I don't live in North America, or Europe (Preferred locations, I live in Asia), and I think higher education is the best way into these countries. I'm fine with any European or North American country, though I would love it if it were in America, or Scotland (LOVE the countryside!)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm also open to any other recommendations that you may have with respect to career paths, I'm pretty much open to anything. I don't have a \"this is how it is supposed to be\", as long as I enjoy the task at hand - solving problems, guiding a product through to completion, communicating with the team, having a good time!, I'm okay with pretty much anything, as long as it has growth and stability, from personal responsibilities point of view. I'm not particular about \"fast\" or \"slow\" paced jobs, any pace would do, as long as it was engaging, fun, and gave me enough to take care of my responsibilities and peace. Any other responsibilities that went with the job, like late night calls, sudden product disruptions, long weeks leading up to a release, and working from home on Holidays, are totally okay!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMy profile summary is as below, what would you recommend I do? There are opportunities in my country to pick up where I left off, but the competition is stiff, and I am not keen to pick up with the same role, which is why I'm asking about the degrees/programmes, also I can afford to pay for them, plus I'm 27 and would love to get started right away with a move, but it looks like in order to do this, I will need either time (and luck, in my country, to approach this from a professional point of view), or a degree in the country of interest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat would be some good degrees/programmes to pursue? Does the University matter? What certifications should I also consider? What are the opportunities in these areas (North America, Scotland, and Europe), like? Are there some other paths you would recommend to Product Management?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nProfile Summary (Most Recent, first):\n&nbsp;\n\n* 3+ Years of Total IT Industry experience as Software Tester in Agile/Scrum\n&nbsp;\n\n* 1+ Years of Marketing/Client Communications in a Startup\n&nbsp;\n\n* 6 Months of Marketing Internship in an Educational Institution\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeel free to ask for any additional details, will be ready to share!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany thanks!",

Looking to move stateside and considering getting a degree in data analytics, quantitative marketing to bolster my employability. Am I on the right track? I have big choices ahead of me.\n\nI spent the last 8 years working for advertising agencies in the Persian Gulf. The quality of my work experience was not as robust as it should've been, but I did manage to get an MBA from a Dutch university and save about $60k in the process. Now in my 30's, I realize that that staying in the middle east much longer is going to have a detrimental effect on my future career prospects in the US. Thus, I am trying to path my way out of here.\n\nI have no connections to the American advertising world and doubt that my experience here will be of much value. I am also somewhat introverted. For these reasons, I am looking to branch out into a separate (but related) field that would compliment my MBA.\n\nMy interest in digital marketing and the rise of big data compelled me to consider a career in data analytics/science. I started applying to Data Analytics, Marketing Analysis, Info Management programs in Europe (tuition is much cheaper there). My hope is that getting a skill set in this area will make me far more employable. I got accepted to a Marketing Analytics Program in Holland and a Stats/Info-management program in Portugal. I am also considering short-term certificate programs.\n\nI am not 100% fixated on DA and would consider other fields though.\n\nAlternatively, I could just quit my job, move back to the states and start applying to different positions. But do I have the credentials to land a decent position?",

    "text": "22 - Should I quit my first BA job after 3 months? I'm a recent college grad who just started my job as a Business Analyst three months ago. Right now I'm ready to quit.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI've always been interested in using technology to solve business problems, so when I saw this role initially I thought it was a great fit for me. The job description spoke of gathering business requirements, business process analysis and improvement, and consulting on the best ways to implement our software. The company is an a very narrow industry (it licenses software for a very specific and complex manufacturing process). We have the American rights for this software that is based out of Europe.   \n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nHere's the problem: I've done none of those things since I was hired. This company is extremely small (~10 people in the office) and I've quickly discovered that my supervisor and management in general is far too overwhelmed to involve me in anything even remotely important. There always seems to be a \"crisis\" with our clients, and this is largely due to the product. It's terrible software, but it's the only one of its kind and our company rides their monopoly like nothing else. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI was supposed to receive full training to learn this industry and get involved, but my supervisor always seems to run into problems with clients and never has the time to sit down with me and show me the ropes. This cycle repeats over and over; I've never been trained properly, so I can't help my supervisor. My supervisor can't train me because they're always too busy putting out fires and managing our clients.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nNow, I've tried my hardest to teach myself, but this is an industry where you have to know extremely specialized and complicated manufacturing processes. I'm not an engineer by any means, and recognize my own limitations here. I'm getting extremely frustrated with this lack of understanding. \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSo, the net result is that I've been stuck with meaningless jobs - data entry, sending emails to schedule meetings for my boss, cleaning up the kitchen... all of which are tasks that have nothing remotely to do with my job. I spent the entire day today manually checking items off a spreadsheet from a budget for 2014. When I tried to automate it, my boss got upset and told me that wasn't the \"proper company method\". The results were IDENTICAL and yet he still wouldn't allow me to automate. It's almost as if they're filling my days with useless tasks on purpose to keep me \"busy\" and occupied, when I know that my time could be put to so much better use.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI've tried speaking to my supervisor about this multiple times and have told him that I simply don't have enough work to do, and have practically begged him to give me more work or training so I can get involved with clients.\n \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe salary is also below average, but I was looking for a job for months after I graduated and took this one because I thought it was manageable. My supervisor has said on many occasions that the CEO will pay me more when I can show that I've \"demonstrated value\", but they aren't giving me any opportunities to do so and I am restricted from creating my own. He's talking about 4-5 year timelines when I feel like I should be doing a lot more now.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI'm willing to work hard for this, but I feel like I'm hitting the ceiling already and it's barely been 3 months. I can't continue to work at their pace doing meaningless administrative jobs for the next few years. I don't want to throw my career away by leaving too early, nor do I have a new job lined up yet. I am considering starting to look again.\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI had a meeting with my boss and the CEO on Friday last week, they apologized and promised more work for me. Today my entire day was spent doing customer support helping a new user go through the user manual and set up the program. This was NOT what I signed up for. Would appreciate any advice or guidance. Thanks. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**TL;DR: BA job hasn't turned out at all like I expected. No training from Boss and finding it difficult to see how I can get more involved when they don't have time to work with me. Considering leaving for something better.**\n\n&nbsp;",

    "text": "Terrible performance in school and only took QA internships. All hope of a software developer position was lost.. until today as I just accepted a software developer job! (A retrospective view of my job hunt) I thought that I was stuck in QA for the rest of my life.  A software development gig in the USA (I'm Canadian) was my end goal, but with terrible performance in school and internships in QA, I thought that was out of reach.\n\n**Before interviewing (my credentials)**\n\nI took my first internship in QA because it seemed like a cool place to start.  And it was.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a blast finding bugs and speeding through every single manual test case faster than my other coworkers in QA.  I learned so much about QA that I didn't realize existed before.  I made it my goal to learn as much as I can, since internships are a great opportunity to learn too.  My boss was a great mentor; he taught me everything there was to know about QA.  Near the end of my internship (it was 8 months) my boss took a few days off and allowed me to lead the team with another member of QA.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, programming was always my end goal, so probably 5% of my time (and some lunch hours) was spent working on scripts that would automate things.  Sometimes I would show my QA coworkers the scripts, sometimes they'd glance at me and ask it.  They weren't a lot of scripts, but they were enough to pad my resume with.\n\nMy next internship was in QA because I couldn't find a position in software development (I feel like my grades and cover letter were the reason why, with more emphasis on grades).  All of the software developer jobs that I applied for didn't respond, while 10%-20% of the QA jobs that I applied for did, so I took them with the intention of doing things similar to my first internship (ie. write scripts in my own time while at work).  At this company my boss liked my performance which lead to an extension of my internship.  My boss got a QA intern for another 4 months, while I got a few extra bullet points to put down on my resume.\n\nI failed my first CS class, which shows up on the first page of reading my transcript.  Imagine reading someone's transcript and seeing an F on the first page.  Not a good start, eh?  I also ended up failing data structures and algorithms. But hey, that's okay, a lot of people fail, so I put on my big boy pants and attempt it again.  This time is different though; I get a tutor and go to every single office hour.  Yet even with tutors and getting extra help the final was too much for me to handle, so I end up failing it once more.  That's *not* okay, how the hell does someone bounce back from this?  Turns out, there's a way.  My school requires you have a streak of great semesters before you can take a class for a third time.  So I ponied up and fucking had three semesters of great performance (not enough to bring my GPA above 3.0, but enough to retake the class again).  I retook the class and somehow passed it.  How I did so much better this time... I have no clue.  Every single examination was so much easier (except for my final, which I fucked up on, but the rest of my grades were enough to save me from another dreaded F).  I also had to retake Calculus 1 because I didn't meet the prerequisites for Calculus 2.\n\n**Getting that interview**\n\nSo how does someone that graduates with a bad GPA (2.7), failed Data Structures and Algorithms twice, retook four classes, and only took QA internships get interviews for software developer positions?  Honestly, the only relevant thing in that list of fuck ups is that I only took QA internships.  Not a single company asked for my GPA, and only one of 250 companies asked for my transcript.  So how *does* someone that only took internships in QA get an interview for a software developer position?  By marketing themselves as a developer.\n\nI wasn't a software developer nor did I have any work experience in roles that didn't have the letters \"QA\", so a lot of people that reviewed my resume often tossed it after reading those two letters.  90% of the work that I did at both places was QA work (manual testing).  However, that 10% is what I capitalized on in my resume.  I made sure that I never mentioned anything about manual testing, designing test cases, or anything else that I learned from my first internship in QA.  I did know that testing knowledge is very important, though, so I touched up on it in my cover letters.  I didn't shy away from my job title being \"QA Tester\", since that's the role that I was given.  With that said, my resume gave off the impression that I was a tool developer from the scripts that I created.  I was able to say that I worked on x, or developed y, or extended the functionality of z even though I only spent 3 hours on it.  I was also able to put that my internship was extended, which is a great thing to put on a resume when the things above it are development oriented.  Lastly, I was able to talk about the specific bullet points without hesitations or \"umm\"s.  If it was on my resume, you know damn well that I'd be able to talk about it for 10 minutes.\n\nI also had a lot of help from my personal projects.  These are VERY important.  Don't just make CRUD apps that you can whip up in a few hours.  I took concepts from my upper division CS classes and applied them to my own questions to find interesting answers.  One of these projects took one month, while another took four months.  I also had an iOS app that took 9 months.  These say a lot about your programming work ethic.\n\n**My actual job application process and interviewing**\n\nThough I graduated in June, I started applying in January 2017.  A lot of people here suggest applying in the Fall so that you'd have full time positions lined up by graduation, but a lot of the places that I applied to in January said that they \"can't see that far into the future\" for May positions.  They also said that \"they're looking for people to join the team in the next few weeks, not months\".  But that's okay.\n\nAt the beginning of my job hunt, my cover letter began as a full page of text with one paragraph brown-nosing the company, three paragraphs explaining how well I'd perform three bullet points from on the ad, and a final paragraph rewording the first paragraph.  It was very formal, with the name of the hiring manager (if their name is gender ambiguous I'd waste a lot of time doing my research on the company website or Linkedin trying to find out if they're male or female so that their salutation is correct; or address it to Hiring Manager), address, country, zip/postal code.  At the end of my job search (and the cover letter that got me a job) my cover letter was usually half a page.  The first paragraph was one sentence that said that I saw their ad on Indeed/company's career site/Friend's Facebook post.  The next paragraph was a paragraph that linked as much of their required skills and job duties to my own experiences in software development (basically saying how I'm a 80% match to what they're looking for).  I also added that I have a brain for testing, if it was an SDET role.  Sometimes I'd separate this into two paragraphs, cause no one likes reading big-ass paragraphs.  The last paragraph was a closing statement about me getting my degree, and how excited I am to work for that company.  If the company was american, I'd include ~~my favorite beer, why, and a link to the political party that I fully support~~ that I'm eligible for TN status to work at said company.\n\nOf around 250 applications, I had 26 companies actually move forward to a phone interview or online assessment.  My favorite interview experiences are the ones that started off with an HR phone screen.  It felt like they actually cared about the people that they were interviewing.  I applied to several positions at every company, and while I wrote a cover letter for every single one, it was difficult for me to know exactly which position I was being interviewed for.  One thing that I really appreciated was when the recruiter would tell me exactly the position that I was being interviewed for, rather than guessing what position it's for.  If they didn't tell me, I'd ask, but sometimes the responses and answers are more vague than the job duties in the position description.  This is painful when the first interview is a technical interview and you don't know if you need to brush up on your linux admin tools cause one of the jobs that you applied to was part of the infrastructure team.  This happened and it was so annoying.  My worst technical phone interview experience was one where the guy asked me a question that was totally irrelevant to the things that he suggested online in preparation for technical interviews.  In this experience I was given the name of my interviewer, and the HR person suggested that I visit his LinkedIn and tech blog.  On his tech blog he had suggestions on how to prepare for interviews, but the interview that I had with him was totally fuckin different than what he suggested on his blog post.  The phone call also cut off in the middle of the conversation (never ever happened with my other phone interviews which are all done in my room)!\n\nOf those 26 companies, I had on-campus interviews with 5 different companies.  Three of them were in Canada (local), and two of them were in the USA (they paid for flight, hotel, expenses, and one of them paid for the rental car).  I had no experience with LeetCode when I started.  Looking back at how I approached my interview questions, holy shit did I need LeetCode.  I never thought it would make me a better developer, but it did.  It changed the way that I thought about my problems.  I never broke down problems into potential data structures that I could use, and instead, just hacked something together.  But then again, interviews just want to see that someone knows how to program, right?! (no)  Though exhausting, my favorite on-campus interviews were the ones where you were there for the entire day.  I appreciated this because you didn't need to go back to the company for a second time.  It also helped with nerves to get past the first interviewer.  In the first interview, my brain is foggy as hell and I'm not as sharp when it comes to coming up with an optimal solution.  But once that first interview is done my brain is wired and ready to go.  It also helps me understand the culture of the workplace when I'm there for 6-8 hours, rather than there for just one.\n\nOf those 5 different companies, I had a verbal offer from two of them (both in the USA) and got a written offer from one of them.  I got Company A's verbal offer on a Thursday morning, and got Company B's verbal offer on the afternoon of the Friday following it.  Company A offered more than Company B and offered a signing bonus that Company B did not offer, so I told Company B my offer from Company A, and she told me that she'd try to get the guys upstairs to match it, but there's no guarantees.  At 5:40 PM (on that Friday) I receive an email from Company A that they won't be continuing with me.  On Monday (That weekend felt like months tbh, couldn't sleep, questioned whether I should've just taken the offer and tell HR that the verbal offer with the other company fell through) she called me and told me that there's no jump in salary but she could give me a signing bonus which was higher than Company A's signing bonus (which was effectively 0, and so was their salary), to which I accepted.\n\n**Too long, did not read**\n\n* I had two 8 month internships in QA but wanted to get a software developer job\n\n* At both QA gigs I would devote 5-10% of my time (Lunch hours, time that wasn't spent on Reddit) to working on scripts\n\n* Marketed myself as a developer on my resume.  Some interviewers even said that they would consider my previous roles as a tool developer, not a QA tester\n\n* My cover letter started off as a full page of filler for two to three points related to the job, but eventually was trimmed down to half a page of good content that was really really related to the job\n\n* Sent 250 applications, 26 moved forward with phone interviews or online assessments\n\n* Only one company asked for my transcript\n\n* From 26 phone interviews/online assessments came 5 companies that wanted to see my human form\n\n* From 5 companies that saw me in person, I got two verbal offers (both USA) and one written offer (accepted after an excruciating weekend)\n\n* Verbal offers can fall through\n\n**Last minute comments**\n\n* If I could do it again, I wouldn't.  I hate interviews and hate applying for jobs even more.\n\n* Rejections hurt in the beginning, but eventually you become numb to them\n\n* The mental toll that I had waiting for Company B to come back to me was worse than waiting for marks to come back from an exam that you're not sure if you passed or not.  If you're not a top tier developer like myself and you're desperate for a job, I recommend taking it.  The signing bonus that I got is great but mental health is greater.\n\n* Start using sites like Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks.  I really like the Leetcode random button.\n\n* For the most part, Glassdoor interviews were unreliable\n\n* To be honest this subreddit didn't help at all\n\n* What helped more than anything is looking my interviewers up on Linkedin so that I can ask questions that are more tailored to them.  \n\n* At one company I asked HR what work-life balance was like, and she said that it's great, that the company values having your own healthy life outside of the company.  At the same company, I asked about worklife balance to a senior developer that's been there for 3 years, and he said that typically developers show up at 10 am and leaves at 7:30 pm.  Noped out of that.\n\nThanks for reading, everyone.\n\nEdit: Made things easier to read.",

    "text": "How do I know if I should quit my job as a junior developer? I'm a junior dev at a startup in New York. When I joined the company I didn't have any experience or a degree but even with that in mind, I'd still say my knowledge of Ruby/RoR at least was *approaching* that of a mid-level developer. The only company that would give me a job at the time primarily use Golang, which I sorta knew but not really. I told them this and they said it'd be cool and that I could work on one or two minor Ruby projects and do some customer support (everyone at the company was expected to do this back then) before eventually progressing to a mid-level role and working on Go code.\n\nSo it's been six months now and I feel that while my understanding of Go and the technologies my company specializes in have improved, they haven't improved anywhere near fast enough. There wasn't really much of a dev team when I joined (it was just me, another junior developer, a contractor and our CEO alongside less technical members of senior management). The CEO left the country a few months ago and now works from home but even when he was around, he was often pretty much doing his own thing and we were left to our own devices much of the time. Even now that they've hired more experienced staff, I still feel like I'm not getting the level of support I need. I don't expect anyone to teach me Go and I try not ask questions about it unless it becomes a blocker. But often when I raise a question about the way in which our core product functions in the company's Slack channel, I'm either ignored, forced to make do with the fact that nobody in my time zone understands the code well enough to know the answer, given answers that confuse more than help or, on rare occasions, belittled for not knowing the answer already even though everyone knows how much the existing documentation sucks. As a result, I often feel overwhelmed by the support side of my role and even on days where there are barely any user queries, I'm plagued by issues with the build environment that nobody can ever help me with or assigned confusing tasks that seemingly no one understands. I don't even really get to code all that much and often just feel more like an overpaid application support engineer than a developer.\n\nI don't know if this is all just growing pains and if I should just keep at it or if this really is a bad environment for me. Even though I feel really lonely most of the time (most of the other developers work from home in different states and I actually don't have that much in common with any of them - I'm the only African American and one of only three women in the company, I'm the only developer who doesn't either have a CS degree or 5 years+ of experience, etc.), I do actually really like the people I work with. At the same time, I worry that I might be being taken advantage of, which just tends to happen to me a lot in general. I've considered leaving but I'm also conscious of the fact that almost none of the code I've worked on in the last six months has been made public so, to a potential employer, I'd look as though I were in the same position as I was back when I was looking for a job six months ago.\n\nAny thoughts?",

I have noticed that many accounting jobs in Europe use the title, “Financial Controller”. However, the job descriptions are somewhat vague\nMy Questions: What is a Financial Controller? What level (number of years) of experience is necessary to be a Financial Controller?  And how is the position different from being an accountant?\nI tried the research online, but most of the information that I could find just said that it was a difference in the job title naming convention between the US and Europe.\nIn the US, a Controller is typically a middle-manager with probably a minimum of 7 years of experience (although many companies might prefer someone 10-15 years of experience). They will typically have a large group of people reporting to them either directly (like managers) or indirectly (like entry-level staff).",

    "text": "International Transfer Case - Need Advice I recently transferred to the north American office of my consulting firm from a developing country. As you may know, like many others, my firm allows only the top performers to make an international transfer. So, think of me as someone who does a good job on any project and whose partner thinks very highly of him.\n\nHowever, after spending some time in this country (great country BTW), I have come to realize that being a non-native English speaker has a distinct disadvantage compared to my peers especially at the higher levels (~manager+). I would not say that I had not expected it but I certainly did under-estimate the enormity of the challenge. It has begun to impact my morale.\n\nDo we have anyone on this subreddit who is a case of an international transfer especially someone coming from a non-native English speaking country? How did you assimilate in the new culture? It takes years to really understand all the references, right context, American psychology (behavior drivers) to do that small talk and make a 'real' connection with the prospective client who would 'like' you and 'want' to work with you. This becomes more important especially if big part of your role is going to be selling your firm's services. Of course partners are there to help, but I will certainly need to overcome this challenge on my own if I want to be successful at my firm. I am pretty confident about ‘executing’ any kind of project but unfortunately that's not going to be enough going forward if I want to survive and progress further. Any advice would be really appreciated. All inputs are welcome. Thanks.",

    "text": "Angry Letter I Wrote 2 Years Ago I can’t help but to think the only real reason I can’t seem to get any type of  production artist/ graphic design/ or screen printing position is because I’m a young black female. I usually hate throwing the race card in but I don’t know where else to turn. Never mind the fact that I have the degree required for these companies in the first place. It’s strange how every time I contact these companies when I see that there is a new space open they’re either “too busy” to take a minute to talk to me or the position has been filled. I polish my resume and cover letter well and because my name isn’t ethnic sounding I usually get asked to come in for an interview (Why is that still a thing in 2015?) Professionally dressed and well spoken. Only to keep getting turned down because I’m not the blonde Brittany stereotype that was assumed on paper.\n \nI can’t even seem to get a position at art retail stores. I don’t seem to fit the mostly white male hipster vibe most of them seem to have. When asked how I could contribute to the sales I explained how I do my own illustration and how I can give others that come into the store my own input on supplies and materials. Even left business cards at the end of the interview but I either get told that I’m too over qualified or too under qualified and don’t get the position. Most of the yelp reviews of one art supply store in particular was saying how most the sales associates don’t even know their products at all. \n\nThe summer between my junior and senior year of college I had applied to an AC Moore where the hiring manger was an alumni of the school I was going to and saw how qualified I was but did I get hired nope! I went back a few weeks later to pick up supplies for a watercolor painting I wanted to do and I happened to pick up a sheet of Arches cold press watercolor paper that didn’t have a code bar. The red haired girl ringing me up got confused and to this day that statement still rings in my head as she asked her co-workers “How much is this poster board?” I was done literally just done right then and there. I didn’t get hired but this girl who does not even know the difference between watercolor paper and poster board got hired probably solely on her looks alone.\n\nSame thing goes for all those companies that turned me down. One screen printing place had a manager that told me that he couldn’t hire me because he couldn’t afford to pay me. (But he sure as hell paid for a damn chiropractor the same day he let me go and spent half the day shooting hoops smh). Not all young black people like myself are the way Fox News likes to portray us; most of us have goals and aspirations outside of twerking or being labeled “thugs”\n\nI’m not “right” for those jobs but I sure as hell was qualified to waste seven months of my life working in a burger joint. Not once I did have the energy to even do my illustration pick up a pencil or paintbrush because of that dead end low paying barely making it job. Didn’t learn any new pen and ink styles I wanted to further develop but I was pretty damn good at salting fries all day. I was tired all the time and at 22 to 23 years old I should have all the energy in the world but I didn’t. In fact when my manger let me go he had just hired his brother as a line cook despite him not shaving his Santa beard and working the grill (nasty) must be nice.\n\nSo now I’m back to square one once more trying to hopefully get employed again soon. But right now my main focus is trying to get new artwork done since I spent the past year just kind of drifting because of financial worries. I have lost sight of this is something that I love and it’s not a job it’s me building a career. I still dream of being a children’s book illustrator and I’m not ready to throw in the towel just yet. In fact I want to strive to be the very first African American woman to win the Caldecott Medal. That the type of quality illustration I want to be making and if I ever get to that level they’ll be the ones sorry for overlooking me.",

    "text": "Question / Idea for American feminists in the \"Women in Tech\" movement This question is mostly directed at American feminists, since in other countries, lack of representation of women in tech seems not to be as dramatic.\n\nI work in Silicon Valley, at a tech company, and the majority of my co-workers are of South Asian or East Asian descent. I would say about 75% of my co-workers are men, and 25% are women. Of the women, virtually 100% are of South Asian or East Asian descent (for the men, 80% are of South Asian or East Asian descent). Most of the men and women I work with are immigrants here in America on H1B visas (a controversial topic in its own right - which I won't bother debating here). FWIW, I was raised in the US, am a US citizen.\n\nIf the goal is to increase representation of women in tech,wouldn't the easiest way be to require a certain quota of H1B visas be allocated to women only? On my team, I have hired both men and women on H1Bs, and on average, I see absolutely no difference in their talent and abilities. I do, however, notice that I only ever seem to receive resumes from female engineers who are immigrants from East or South Asia, the majority of them on H1Bs.\n\nThe process of \"competing\" for one of the limited H1B visas is a difficult and arduous one for the technical talent that comes to this country. Often times, talented women engineers from other countries cannot get these visas. Wouldn't the most efficient way to increase the representation of women in tech be to require a high proportion of the H1Bs that are granted to foreign tech talent be given to women only? Is this something feminists should advocate for as an efficient way to improve the women in tech problems? If there was a requirement that H1B visas can only be given to women, there would be a large influx of female tech talent to this country, and technical roles in my company would almost immediately be at least 60% women.\n\nAsking as a curious manager at a Silicon Valley tech company who has hired and worked with many (90%+ foreign born) men and women, and has seen no difference in technical competence between the two genders.",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "ELLA - independent short film about Asian Americans in the midwest! Hey, my name is Douglas Kim, I'm a writer/producer living in Los Angeles.\n\nI'm producing a short film of a coming of age story that takes place in small town America.  The film follows the unlikely bond between Abe, a high school recluse and Ella, a charismatic college dropout, as they navigate the streets and social groups of their community.\n\nThe film features a notable Asian TV actor (Nichole Bloom of NBC's \"Superstore\"), offers a new setting for an Asian American story, and follows Asian characters who are integrated in their community, going through universal struggles while dealing with their outsider status in subtle but real ways.\n\nThe film will use an experimental, one-of-a-kind, camera rig that allows for a digital IMAX image.\n\nWith the success of Moonlight and other independent films, it's my belief that film is the way Asian Americans become normalized in America, where we can be seen as Americans pursuing our own version of the American dream.  I think we can accomplish that and more with our film.\n\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid\n\nWould love it if you can support and share our vision!\n\n\nmore from the director, Dan Chen:\n\nNichole Bloom and Dan Chen have been friends since they attended USC. After Nichole’s successful climb into American television, and Dan’s online awards for his short films (danchen.co), the two decided to collaborate once more on a character-driven project with the intention of festival recognition, online release, and a proof-of-concept for universal Asian American stories.\n\nDan, on the film’s story: “The underlying theme is one of “selling out,” as Abe distances himself from Ella to fit in with new kids he’s met. As an outsider, can he only fit in by submitting to the dominant views of his peers? Or is there a way he can stay loyal to his loved ones, without being left out of the larger community? The film’s story is character-driven and specific, but acts as a metaphor for the Asian American experience. Do we stay in our place, assimilate, or somehow find a third way of being?”\n\nThe camera rig was built by cinematographer Philips Shum, who has shot music videos featuring Diddy, Schoolboy Q, and Drake. It uses the principal of 35mm lens adapters, while increasing the size to accommodate a 56mm x 56mm frame, to create a low-budget solution for an IMAX field of view.\n\nElla is to be produced by Eric Cook and Douglas Kim with Evidence Films, Varient Entertainment, and Justice Tech Industries attached.",

In recent years, the horrific stories of rape in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the mass rape by the military and the militia in Rwanda have shown how particularly vulnerable women are in conflicts – how they are often singled out for human rights violations which are not inflicted on men and how assault on a woman’s body is used as a weapon of war.”\n\nIn a speech to the First Ladies' Conference on Domestic Violence in San Salvador in 1998, feminist politician [Hillary Clinton said](https://web.archive.org/web/20061028234519/http://clinton3.nara.gov:80/WH/EOP/First_Lady/html/generalspeeches/1998/19981117.html), “Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children.”\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, at the March 1999 Inter-Agency Videoconference for a World Free of Violence against Women, [lamented](https://web.archive.org/web/20080325035702/http://www.scienceblog.com:80/community/older/archives/L/1999/A/un990269.html), “Violence against women is perhaps the most shameful human rights violation. And, it is perhaps the most pervasive.\"\n\nAnd so it goes, up and down the international community, from human rights groups and heads of state, to organized feminists and the mainstream media – all regularly and rightly deploring governments’ savaging of females.\n\nYet when it comes to the inhumane treatment of noncombatant men and boys, nearly everyone seems to have incurred a severe case of laryngitis. By expressing little or no outrage for male victims of government barbarity — or altogether denying there are male victims, as Amnesty often seems to do — the international community does worse than merely expose an antimale bias that gainsays its own long-running plea for equal treatment of the sexes. It also helps perpetuate state-directed brutality against both men and women.\n\nPerhaps before one can even be willing to hear how a greater outrage over anti-female violence could possibly perpetuate this violence, one must be disaffected of the feminist-and-media-driven notion that females are overwhelmingly the marks for governments’ enormities. One must be convinced that men, including non-combatant men, are marked at least as much and that an equal outrage for male victims is therefore justified.\n\nEnter Adam Jones. He is executive director of the Canadian-based human rights group, [Gendercide Watch](http://www.gendercide.org/), and professor of international studies at the Center for Research and Training in Economics in Mexico City. Defining “gendercide” as gender-selective mass killings, Jones has amassed considerable documentation and published scholarly works showing that non-combatant males are subjected to atrocities and mistreatments comparable to, and in many cases worse than, those dealt females.\n\nNon-combatant men, says Jones, “have been and continue to be the most frequent targets of mass killing and genocidal slaughter, as well as a host of lesser atrocities and abuses. The mass killing of males, particularly of ‘battle-age’ men, has roots deep in the history of conflict between human communities. Despite this prevalence of gendercide against males...the subject has received almost no attention across a wide range of policy areas, humanitarian initiatives, and academic disciplines. We at Gendercide Watch feel it is one of the great taboos of the contemporary age, and must be ignored no longer.”\n\n(Jones puts “battle-age” in quotation marks “to problematize a term that rolls off the tongue too easily. The ‘battle-age’ construction implicitly assumes that if a male is of an age that renders him liable to military conscription and combat, his entire identity should be so defined. This renders the analyst complicit with those who would subordinate the destiny of ‘battle age’ males to this outside demand – akin to defining women by their capacity to be raped, and suggesting as well that ‘battle-age’ men are ‘asking for it.’ With this equation of males and combatants completed, the analyst or policymaker can move to the final stage of effacing all non-combatant males from the policy and analytical equation, a phenomenon that is also commonplace.”)\n\nJones’ Gendercide.org is rich in examples of widely ignored gendercides against males. Some from the 20th century are:\n\n* Kosovo, 1999: “Although the Milosevic regime's genocidal assault on Kosovar society swept up all other sectors of the population, killing many and expelling hundreds of thousands, the most systematic and severe atrocities were inflicted disproportionately upon non-combatant men.”\n\n* Srebrenica (Bosnia), 1995: “The long-term success of ethnic cleansing depended on killing off the Muslim men, without whom the population's women and children would have no means of returning.”\n\n* Rwanda, 1994: “[After the massacre] Rwanda became a country of women. It is currently estimated that 70 per cent of the population is female and that 50 per cent of all households are headed by women.” \n\n* Iraq, 1988, 1990-91: During the 1990-91 Gulf War, though officials and the media decried Iraqi troops’ abuse of Kuwaiti and foreign women, little was said of the broader Iraqi system of detention, torture, and execution of tens of thousands of Kuwaitis who were nearly all male. The Iraqi regime’s postwar attack on the Shia “marsh Arabs” in southern Iraq appears to have been highly gender-specific. A Middle East Watch researcher explained, “The troops are arresting all males over 15 and taking them to Radwaniyeh [prison camp]. They’re never seen again.” Thousands are estimated to have died, often after horrific torture. In 1988, during the suppression of rebellious Iraqi Kurds, Middle East Watch reported instances in which men and boys among the captured villagers were executed on the spot. Many tens of thousands of Kurdish males disappeared. The organization suspects that most of them, if not all, were murdered by Iraqi security forces.\n\n* Delhi, 1984: In “Delhi: Gangster Rule,” Madhu Kishwar reports on the 1984 anti-Sikh rioting in New Delhi following the assassination of Indira Gandhi: “The nature of the attacks confirm [sic] that there was a deliberate plan to kill as many Sikh men as possible, hence nothing was left to chance. That also explains why in almost all cases, after hitting or stabbing, the victims were doused with kerosene or petrol and burnt, so as to leave no possibility of their surviving. Between October 31 and November 4, more than 2,500 men were murdered in different parts of Delhi, according to several careful unofficial estimates. There have been very few cases of women being killed except when they got trapped in houses which were set on fire. Almost all the women interviewed described how men and young boys were special targets. When women tried to protect the men of their families, they were given a few blows and were forcibly separated from the men. Even when they clung to the men, trying to save them, they were hardly ever attacked the way men were. I have not yet heard of a case of a woman being assaulted and then burnt to death by the mob.”\n\n* Bangladesh, 1971 (then East Pakistan): In February of that year, the generals of West Pakistan decided to crush the Awami League, which had demanded regional autonomy for East Pakistan and an end to military rule. “Kill three million of them,” said President Yahya Khan at the February conference, “and the rest will eat out of our hands.” At the end of this brutal campaign, 80 percent of the estimated 3 million lives taken in the systematic mass killings were males, many of them adolescent boys.\n\n* World War II, 1941-42: During Operation Barbarossa in just eight months of 1941-42. Invading German armies killed approximately 2.8 million Soviet PoWs through starvation, exposure, and summary execution. “This little-known gendercide,” says Adam Jones, “vies with the genocide in Rwanda as the most concentrated mass killing in human history.” Adam Jones classifies this as a gendercide because “PoW did not just mean men who had seen military service. Nazi policy was explicitly that all men between 15 and 65 were to be taken to PoW camps.”\n\n* Armenia, 1915: According to Jones as interviewed in March 2000 by the Ottawa Citizen’s Christina Spencer, “The first step of that brutal terror was the disarming of conscript Armenian soldiers in the Turkish army. They were turned into pack animals, ‘driven by the whips and bayonets of the Turks into the mountains.’ The weak were left to die or were shot. Next, civilian males were taken from their towns and slaughtered. At this point, the rest of the population -- women, children, the elderly -- were deported.”\n\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Forty million Soviet men were killed between 1914 and 1945. Some families lost every man in the family: dad, son, brother, uncle. Yet a headline in Parade, the largest-selling weekly magazine in the world, reads “Short End of the Stick” with the article explaining Soviet women are getting the short end of the stick because they are stuck with factory and street-cleaner positions. In Bosnia, the civil war has wiped out men so disproportionately that only 30% of the Bosnian population are men. Do headlines tell us, “War leaves Bosnia with 30% Men”? No. Parade’s headline reads, “Women Look to Gain Power in Bosnia.” The focus on the sacrifice made by men as a gender was not only ignored, but Bosnia has specifically been used as an example of the type of war in which both sexes are killed equally. When there’s a story about a man being killed, the focus is not on the sacrifice of men, but of their role. We discover the sacrifice of men as a gender only when it is needed to help us understand the new burdens on women. — ***The Myth of Male Power***, by [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20071107132658/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_5.htm)|\n\n**Adam Jones** also tackles military conscription as a gender-selective abuse. Though sexual slavery of females is easily seen as such an abuse, conscription is not. But Jones says it is “a variant, perhaps the most destructive one, of forced labour, an institution that has led to millions of overwhelmingly male deaths throughout history.” More than 36 million military men died in the last century’s top 20 wars alone. Even today the Russian Army, according to Gendercide Watch, “remains a death-trap for conscripted men – though not at the hands of a foreign invader. As many as 10,000 soldiers die each year from hazing, assaults, murder, and suicide.” In Afghanistan in 2001, because the media blitzed us with reports – justifiably so – on how the Taliban oppressed Afghan women, hardly anyone learned how life was for Afghan soldiers. In pre-Taliban times, when Afghan women enjoyed many rights, war still took a heavy toll on the men. Of Afghanistan’s conflict with the Soviets that began in 1979, Tamim Ansary, a writer in San Francisco, said in a Salon article: “The refugees in Pakistan, those millions who lived in the squalid camps that spawned the Taliban, were mostly the women and children of the men who stayed in the country to fight the Soviets and die like ants.” Ansary omitted the fact that the vast majority of these males, many in their teens, fought because they were forced to do so, and that the requirement to risk dying “like ants” was not thrust upon females. The later advent of the Taliban and its oppression of Afghan women did not mean that males no longer had to worry about war, about being killed or horribly maimed in battle. For some Afghan men, their fate came earlier than expected from their own government, as when Taliban forces, preparing for their war with America, began conducting house-to-house searches for recruits. “Some recruits who refused to join up,” said the Washington Post citing a defector, “were shot....”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|\"...[I]f they [warring tribes] couldn't recruit able-bodied young boys, they simply kidnapped them. Most of the recruits were 12, 13, 14 years old, but some were young as 6.\" —*Wray Herbert, U.S. News & World Report, December 29, 2004*|\n\nTo better appreciate the gender dimension in military conscription, consider that some countries engaging in guerrilla warfare conscript boys young as six! In Sierra Leone in 1999, says Carol Bellamy, executive director of the UN Children’s Fund, seven-year-olds were among the 2,000 child soldiers who were under arms. Boys are often abducted from their homes, beaten, and told, “You either fight or we will kill you.” The humanitarian group Save The Children estimates that more than 1.5 million child soldiers – virtually all boys, by my estimate – have been killed in conflicts from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir from 1985 to 1995. Consider next that although often desperate for soldiers, the countries that recruit young boys rarely recruit, say, 15-to-17-year-old girls, who are much bigger and stronger than 7-year-old boys, emotionally as well as physically, and hence more combat-capable and militarily useful. ([The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers](https://web.archive.org/web/20061103001657/http://www.child-soldiers.org:80/) says, “In many countries, girls too are used as soldiers, though generally in much smaller numbers than boys.”) The reasons for the conscription of boys undoubtedly include chivalry and the convenience of same-sex armies. But perhaps above all, the nations using boy soldiers may suspect that if in the name of gender equality they equally conscripted girls, the number of people around the world decrying the use of child soldiers — and the efforts to rescue the children — would surge a hundred fold and possibly deprive them of a valuable resource.\n\nStill another broadly ignored government brutality that targets males, as Jones indicates, is the forced labor of civilians. “Throughout history and continuing in modern times,” he wrote in an April 2001 letter to the International Labour Organization (ILO), “the practice of forced labour has overwhelmingly targeted adult able-bodied men, leading to millions if not tens of millions of deaths. Despite this grim record, the ILO’s Forced Labour Convention designates one group and one group only as legitimate targets for forced labour [stress added]: these same adult able-bodied men. Article 11 of the Convention states that ‘Only adult able-bodied males who are of an apparent age of not less than 18 and not more than 45 years may be called upon for forced or compulsory labour,’ so long as ‘ they are physically fit for the work required and the conditions under which it is to be carried out’ and ‘the number of adult able-bodied men indispensable for family and social life’ is allowed to remain in communities targeted for forced labour. In addition, the ILO states that both the forced labour involved in military conscription and the use of prison labour are acceptable under the terms of the Convention. Both of these institutions, of course, target males close to 100 percent of the time.” As just one example of forced male labor, the International Committee of the Red Cross charged that during the Bosnian war, hundreds of people in Serb-held areas were “being forced into what amounts to slave labor in dozens of towns and villages....” The forced laborers were, “for the most part, Croatian and Muslim civilian men.”\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|Imagine the international community’s outrage if the ILO Forced Labour Convention designated only able-bodied females as legitimate targets for forced labor.|\n\nOn rare occasion forced laborers are women. Even then they are luckier than the men. Addressing the enslaving of black Christians in Sudan by Arab militias, newspaper columnist Walter Williams wrote, “They shoot the men and enslave the women and children.” His topic, like that of many who opine on Sudan’s troubles, was slavery. It was not the greater atrocity of men being killed. This atrocity he brought up only once, in passing. He then quickly returned our attention to the women and children. It isn’t difficult to guess what would have been his topic — or how much more vociferous would be the media and feminists — were the Arab militias enslaving the men and children and shooting the women.\n\nAn anti-female atrocity, one that is widely deplored by the media and thus made well known to the world, is “honor” killings or disfigurings of women who disgrace their families. This violence, while not state-directed, is still ignored by police often enough to be deemed virtually government-sanctioned. Covering the topic for ABC television’s “20/20” in January 1999, correspondent Diane Sawyer intoned somberly, “In Jordan alone, a quarter of all the homicides are honor killings, an average of 25 women at least every year.”\n\nThe male counterpart to honor killings is the “blood feud.” It is rarely mentioned in the media and is therefore almost unheard of. It is even more ignored by governments than honor killings of women.\n\nThe institution of the blood feud, dating to the 15th century and extant in the Balkans, Sicily, and Corsica, was established for the purpose of “cleansing honor.” Offenses to honor include calling a man a liar and insulting a man’s wife. Offenses are paid for, and honor cleansed, says Noel Malcolm, author of Kosovo: A Short History, “by killing any male member of the family of the original offender, and the spilt blood of that victim then cries out to its own family for purification.”\n\nThe blood feud has always exempted females, since killing a woman is considered an extreme violation of a man's personal honor. “The strongest taboo of all concerned the murder of women,” says Malcolm, “and any woman could walk through raging gunfire in the knowledge that she would never be shot at.” Conceivably, assuming Malcolm’s definitions of the blood feud and the “strongest taboo” are correct, a woman could kill a man in another family, then, to avenge his death, that family would kill not her but a male in her family! How quickly would the international community stop ignoring blood feuds if they permitted a man to kill a woman in another family, then, to avenge her death, permitted that family to kill not him but a woman in his family?\n\nSince the collapse of the Soviet Empire, blood feuds have returned full-throttle in Albania, where reconciliation attempts have seen limited success. “Every year,” says Adam Jones, “at least a thousand men and boys die in blood-feud killings in Albania alone; the lives of tens of thousands more are spent in isolation and perpetual fear.” Yet, in covering honor killings, ABC’s “20/20” kept its millions of viewers in the dark about blood feuds and about the vastly larger number of murdered males. It left them to feel outraged only at the “average of at least 25 honor killings of women each year in Jordan alone.” Apparently to “20/20's” staff, the murder of 25 women is more outrageous – and more news-worthy – than a thousand murdered men and boys.\n\nFurther exemplifying their greater mistreatment of males, governments often punish males more severely than females for the same violations of law. This was true of Afghanistan’s Taliban government, though the mainstream media painted the opposite picture with their exclusive focus on that government’s oppression of women. The Taliban’s penal code required that males be punished for violations by females. In December 2001, a Detroit-area television station ran a story about an Afghan woman who defied the Taliban by operating a school. When Taliban troops discovered her, they beat her father.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|When an Afghan man or any other man must endure brutality as well as shame for the religiously “inappropriate” or “illegal” behavior of his family members, we can better understand why he so strongly “wants to control\" his children and his wife: from his view, it makes more sense for them to be oppressed than for him to be both oppressed and brutalized, especially if for a while after being beaten he is unable to work and support them.|\n\nThe Taliban’s penal code also mandated that males be arrested for many other “violations.” “While a woman can be beaten if her face accidentally shows from under her head-to-toe covering,” writes gender expert Cathy Young, author of Ceasefire! Why Women and Men Must Join Forces to Achieve True Equality, “a man can be beaten if his beard isn't long enough. While a woman who commits adultery faces execution, the same fate awaits her male lover.” Men were punished even if they didn’t break a certain “rule.” Taliban forces systematically detained and executed male civilians in north-central Afghanistan to deter communities from cooperating with opposition forces. According to one report, Taliban troops were repeatedly described as rounding up unarmed men and boys from their homes and work sites and shooting them in the head. There were no reports of females being shot in the head to deter communities from violating the “Don’t cooperate” rule. Such punishments of Afghan males, unlike those of Afghan females, somehow failed to get a lot of coverage in the mainstream media, especially national television, the sole source of news for a huge number of Americans.\n\nSocial researcher Warren Farrell, author of the riveting [Father and Child Reunion](https://www.amazon.com/Father-Child-Reunion-Bring-Children/dp/0615223931), tells of the 1990 Associated Press story about Bobby Sherrill, who worked in Kuwait. When Sherrill returned to the United States, he was arrested, handcuffed, and taken before a magistrate. He had failed to pay full child support for ninety days. The reason? While he was in Kuwait, Iraq invaded the country and he was kidnapped and taken hostage for three months, during which his father paid some but not all of the support. This explanation failed to impress the magistrate, and he demanded an immediate cash payment. Because Sherrill did not have it on him at the time, he was jailed. (There must be an unwritten law somewhere that requires non-custodial fathers to always carry with them a large sum of cash.)\n\nWhat if Sherrill had been a woman? It is extremely difficult for me to believe she would have been treated so unmercifully for being unable to pay child support as a result of her being kidnapped, being held hostage for three months, and having no cash on her when arrested. Few magistrates would have had the will to jail her under such circumstances and risk incurring the public’s wrath, especially feminists’ wrath. Cathy Young would appear to agree. In Ceasefire! she writes: “There is a deeply entrenched habit in our legal system and our culture of treating female offenders more leniently....” If it were male offenders who were treated more leniently, no doubt many in the media and feminist circles would describe the situation for female offenders as an atrocity. Yet because it is men who are treated less leniently, little is said of it and few people realize that even in the United States, which is often called the world’s most civilized nation, mostly men are denied the civilized part by their government.\n\nCathy Young serves up another example of more severe male punishment: “When American teenager Michael Fay was sentenced [in 1994] to be caned for spray-painting cars in Singapore, the public debate centered on whether harsh penalties were too high a price to pay for public order. The fact that caning is imposed only on men was barely noticed. What if a teenage girl were to be whipped for a petty offense in a country where this penalty was reserved for females? Wouldn’t women’s groups, politicians, and the media have treated this as an outrage against women?” Young apparently thinks yes, for she wrote earlier in a Detroit News column, “...[I]t’s a fact that violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men.”\n\nAnd it is this fact — which is the worst sexism — along with stepped-up feminist pressure to end violence against women worldwide, that has influenced the international community to protest anti-female atrocities and abuses to the point that, as Adam Jones says of Canada’s female-focused mobilizing efforts around ex-Yugoslavia, “one could forget any other category of victim exists.”\n\n**While** the international community’s outrage mostly for female victims intends well, it helps perpetuate governments’ brutality against both males and females for the following reasons:\n\nFirst, there is little evidence to support feminists’ claim in recent years that the greater outcry for female victims has resulted in rape and sexual slavery being taken seriously as war crimes. Cathy Young wrote in September 1996: “‘It's about women and children being tortured and murdered,’ said a Court TV ad for the war crimes trial dealing with the horrors in the former Yugoslavia. Earlier this month, women's rights activists at the 7th International Forum of the Association for Women in Development in Washington, D.C., said the atrocities against women in the Balkans might not have happened if rape and sexual slavery had been taken seriously as war crimes after World War II. Let's look at what has happened to Bosnian men. Time after time, Serb troops would separate the adult men from the women and children, load them onto buses and take them to concentration camps. Many men were subjected to horrible tortures, even forced to sexually mutilate each other. Thousands were massacred. That such crimes were taken seriously after World War II apparently did little to deter the perpetrators.”\n\nAs long as the international community’s outrage is mostly for female victims, some warring groups may think eradicating males will more or less be tolerated if care is taken to safeguard females. But in reality, waging war on males while trying not to harm females is somewhat akin to dynamiting a garden in a vain attempt to kill the weeds but not the vegetables. As stated, women are often beaten or killed for trying to impede warriors’ all-important objective of slaughtering men and boys. Sometimes women simply have the misfortune of being in the path of marauding troops whose respect for life has been traumatized out of them because they have been, Jones says, “brutalized and indoctrinated into committing atrocious and genocidal acts against civilian populations or disarmed enemy forces.” They are not unlike the U.S. troops who in the Vietnam War massacred 300 My Lai villagers, including infants. Such hardened soldiers, realizing they have already committed war crimes against non-combatant males and that their own lives can be violently concluded at any moment, may only sneer at threats of prosecution for committing war crimes against females. Some of them, perhaps having learned of the international community’s demand for treating the sexes equally, may also have learned of the international community’s unequal concern for male victims of governments’ barbarity. Perhaps they are inwardly offended and angered by the hypocrisy and sexism – as a lot of female soldiers surely would be if the concern were mostly for males. “Why should I care for others,” they may think, “when no one cares for me?” Horrible as it is to contemplate, some soldiers may be embittered enough to react to warnings to tread carefully around females in the same defiant manner in which recalcitrants react to “Keep off the grass” signs.\n\n||\n|:------:|\n|“In large part, the atrocities of war are committed as a response to the fear men feel. Terror and humiliation are the combustible fuels of rage.” — Patricia Pearson, *When She Was Bad*, p. 53 hardcover|\n\nHistorically, warring nations and tribes have attacked the enemy’s civilian population as a strategy to terrorize and demoralize. The idea is that if an attack on civilians is massive and shocking enough, an enemy nation might lose its will to fight and surrender, either on its own or under pressure from its citizens. One such attack is the mass sexual assault of women. It often succeeds in terrorizing and demoralizing because, to repeat Cathy Young, violence against women shocks us far more than violence against men. Thus, the more we protest only atrocities against women, suggesting that this violence is more psychologically damaging to a nation, the more we signal that, as Amnesty International puts it, “assault on a woman’s body [can be] used as a weapon of war.” It is true that were the outrage for male victims and female victims equalized tomorrow, the strategic value of assaulting women might not change for some time; the media- and feminist-fueled construct of women as helpless, vulnerable, and deserving special protection — like children — is simply too ingrained in everyone’s psyche. But the international community’s current trend of denouncing only or mostly the atrocities against females can, in the eyes of some warring nations, only help sustain the value of those atrocities.\n\nThe lesser outrage for male victims (it’s lesser largely because for many people “man as victim,” like “woman as victimizer,” is repellent) tends to reinforce – and may in part stem from – the view of males as disposable. Many of us see males this way, explains Warren Farrell, “because we have learned that the more effectively we prepare men to sacrifice themselves, the more we feel protected.” This need for protection, along with the need of a nation to show its will to fight and defend itself from aggressors, may cause many people to think men should be considered disposable. But this view of males carries a significant downside that seems to be rarely thought out. For every aggressive nation or group that “men are disposable” unnerves, it may prompt one or two others to prematurely reject non-violent methods of resolving conflict, and to choose war, setting in motion the atrocities that claim many lives of both males and females.\n\n||\n|:------|\n| [Warren Farrell](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622214727/http://mensnewsdaily.com:80/archive/f/farrell/farrell_1.htm): There is something about women’s role that is also never mentioned. Can you figure it out? Women not sacrificing their lives in war is never discussed as female privilege, as matriarchy.|\n||\n|We saw in the Canadian study of newspapers discussed above how violence against women was portrayed disproportionately to men’s, and was personalized even as men’s was at best a cold statistic.|\n||\n|Here’s why this bias hurts women....|\n||\n|When only women’s suffering is personalized, it motivates us to rescue the woman and assume the cause must be the man. So in problems like domestic violence we blame the man and ignore the male-female dance that leads to both sexes battering each other equally.|\n||\n|This hurts women because, when the man feels he is the assumed cause, he becomes resistant to counseling. He experiences the counseling as identical to his wife – unable to hear him. To him, the counseling is now part of the problem. No, it’s worse than that. Hope disappears, and cynicism appears. And it doesn’t stop there.... He feels both his wife and the system are ganging up against him. Now it’s him against the world, and that’s the set up for mass killings followed by a suicide, which is, and will remain, the male style until men become no more or less worthy as victims than women.|\n\n**Human** rights groups, feminists, the mainstream media, and UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan must cease, as Prof. Adam Jones puts it, “hierarchizing human suffering” to the extent that, for example, “the mass rape of women is privileged over the mass slaughter of (non-combatant) men.” Politicians such as Sen. Hillary Clinton must understand that women do not become war's primary victims by surviving genocides and being driven away from their homes to squalid camps where they have the hope, however dim, of rescue and restoration. War's primary victims are, and have always been, the men who are killed — the husbands, fathers, and sons of the women whose lives generally are spared.\n\nThe international community must express an equal outrage for male victims of atrocities and other abuses. It is a matter not only of honoring true gender equality, but of curbing governments’ brutality against both sexes. As the nuclear age advances, it may also be a matter of preserving our very existence.\n\n***[posted Wednesday, 17 December 2003](https://web.archive.org/web/20061029083745/http://battlinbog.blog-city.com/governments_violence_against_the_sexes.htm)***",

What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "Looking for general career advice from people who have worked abroad. What was it like re-entering the job market in the states? How do employers view candidates with overseas experience not related to the job? Worked in China for about 15 months teaching english to children which was really fun, networked a ton, paid off about half of my student loans, now I am in Korea. Just got hired as a University professor outside of Seoul and would really like to take this year to develop a skill such as becoming fluent in either Chinese or Korean. Mainly because I love communicating with people and I think it would be a beneficial skill to bring back to the states once I decide to return. I mainly came to Korea because my moms family is from Korea and I wanted to learn the language, but I find myself busy with school and I think I would learn the language better if I was enrolled at a Uni! So far, living in Korea isn't really what I expected as far as culture and community. Many Koreans are a bit judge mental and I think Korea has less opportunity than China when it comes to learning a language. I did get an offer at a University in China and the offer is still on the table but the pay is much less, but they did say that I can audit Chinese classes and they will provide me with a working visa. Prior to working abroad I have about year experience working at a PR/Marketing firm doing event coordinating. What jobs can I really look for when I want to come back to the states? I wouldn't want to work in the teaching industry in the US.. Do companies see working abroad as a plus for candidates? I am 26 going on 27, have about $10,000 in student loans and think I think if I stay with the Uni job for a year I can pay off all my student loans by the end of September 2017.",

    "text": "Born and raised As-Am but I refuse to be ashamed of who I am. I'm Chinese - and China has been stereotyped as the world's sweatshop, people with weird eyes, dog eaters and other undesirable things. I also grew up an Asian American, who didn't see race until late high school, but before I could fully understand it, I went back home to China. \n\nMy mom used to microwave vegetable buns she bought from Chinatown for my lunch and I used to bring all sorts of Chinese food for lunch. It got to a point where even other Asians in class started blaming me whenever they smelled something funky. I never once assumed that the way I looked or the food I ate was weird because that's who I was, though luckily for me, nobody made a big deal out of it because I grew up in a diverse neighborhood.\n\nBut as I grew older and traveled beyond my racially diverse, lower-middle class coastal American city, I've noticed that I've slowly become the \"other\" in society. I've begun slight changes in the way people approached me, a certain coldness or strangers acting weirdly confident around me because they assumed or knew I wasn't a local.\n\nWell, I now live in China and I'm past the age where anger was my response to the world. I've accepted that this is the way things are, and all I can say is - it's made things a lot easier for me. I'm a Chinese person who speaks great English and that's who I am - no more dwelling on what my cultural identity is or how I should change who I am just so I can fit in with everyone else. I don't have to be sorry for being Chinese abroad or the fact that I speak great English in China, and I do feel sorry for anyone who doesn't agree. What's there to lose? They'll judge you anyway, do as you wish.\n\nEven though I live in China now, I am still a citizen of another country in the anglosphere, and through that I hope to retain my Westernized Asian identity to the best I can. I also hope I can make friends with other non-Asians who settle in China, but only if they show they have a basic respect of the local culture. I also hope that, through charitable organizations, I can support non-Chinese, non-Han minorities who are born and raised here but sadly isolated from the rest of our society. Is it only because of my experience as an Asian American do I understand what it means to be \"other\", and I am better because of it.\n\nI will respect you when I'm in your house, and you will too when you're in mine - but I will make no concessions regarding who I am, and that applies wherever I go. Place your two feet firmly on the ground and make the world move for you. \n\nIt's that simple.",

    "text": "Advice needed for some near-future options for a debt-saddled humanities major I've been doing a lot of search the past month about finance, student loans, and career choices but I'm needing some advice for my situation. \nI posted this in r/personalfinance but outside of one helpful comment didn't get too much out of it. \n\n*Basic Information*   \n22M, just graduated from a private liberal arts college in the Midwest, BA in Religion (Yes, I know. They sold me well on the \"just get a degree doing what interests you\"). $47.4K in student loans (All federal, minimum 10yr monthly = ~$500). No other debt. I have worked for the college's IT Dept. all four years and while not doing much I have done basic installations and data entry for inventory. Outside of that I have helped teach martial arts to kids (ages 4-15) and adults for ~6 years as well as teach general P.E. to friends and relatives (programming, nutrition, form, etc.).\n\n*Next Year*   \nI am moving to Madrid, Spain to teach English from Oct.-June. Pay is enough to live like a student but not really save up anything significant. I have the option to do a renewal after my first year. I am semi-fluent in Spanish right now and am planning on being fully fluent by the end of the first year.\n\n*Future Time*   \nAfter that program my plan is to teach English in China because the benefits are great and COL so low that I can throw $1000-2000 a month towards my student loans while living a fairly middle-class lifestyle. The thing is to completely pay off my loans it would take anywhere from 2-4 years. In that time there is a possibility for me to move up to a middle management position in schools (recruiting/training teachers, making schedules, coordinating between Chinese and foreign teachers) This means that I will essentially be out of the job market for 4-6 years will minimal experience outside of Spanish and/or Mandarin Chinese and some foreign management skills.\n\n*Questions*   \n1. Is it wiser for my career prospects to do 1 or 2 years in Spain and then return to the US to start entering into the workforce?\n2. From everything that I've seen teaching English abroad is seen as a joke by employers for anything more than 2 years postgrad. How would doing that for essentially 2-6 years look to employers? I don't really want to be a guy close to 30 working entry level because I've been \"bumming it\" across the world.\n3. Would it be better to go to Spain, return home and work a real job for a couple years, and then go to Asia to pay off significant chunks of my debt?\n4. I would ideally like to move to a larger city than where I am now (~225,000 pop.). I know first jobs suck but how could I leverage my skills to make, let's say, $45K salary after 2-3 years? I don't have an interest in learning coding/programming.\n\n*Last Part*   \nAny help is appreciated. Really, my only expectations out of my career is to give me a comfortable salary to save for retirement and allow me to live my generally frugal life.\nSorry if I sound like an entitled millennial, I'm not opposed to working hard at all. Just trying to live smarter not harder.",

    "text": "Received a job offer to teach English in China, how do I negotiate salary? Some background info: Going to teach English in China is one of the things I've been dead set on doing since I've heard about it like a decade ago, so I really do want to try my best to take this offer. However, the offer they made me is a bit low and I'm not sure how to negotiate.  \nI graduated in June of last year and grabbed the first job offer that was thrown my way. It's in the real estate industry and I really don't have an interest in doing this in the long run, but I don't hate it. Overall, I am making a pretty good amount of money for something entry level; however, it has nothing to do with my degree and I myself have no idea what I want to do in the long run. \n\n\n\nThe job will be a contract for a year, and these are the benefits they offer:\n\n* Company sponsored flight to China with transportation from airport to residence   \n* Company sponsored lodging in comfortable and conveniently located apartments for program duration (not including utilities/internet)   \n* TEFL Certification  \n* Free Chinese & Mandarin tutoring through our company partner  \n* Company sponsored coverage with a Chinese healthcare plan  \n* Time off for Chinese national holidays (detailed in contract)  \n* 2 weeks paid vacation and sick leave time besides holiday allowances  \n* Guaranteed year-end raises for qualified individuals renewing their contracts  \n* Airfare coverage for a 2-week home visit between each contract year (1/2 of total airfare for first year, complete coverage for second/each consecutive year)   \nEverything sounds pretty amazing, but I think it is also pretty standard for most of the job offers that have this premise of teaching in China. \n\n\n\nThis is why I haven't accepted the offer yet:   \nThe pay they offered me is really low. It is approximately $1,200.00 USD pretax, monthly. Despite the lower cost of living, I do still have student loans to pay off, and as I am currently making a substantial amount over this, I'm a bit worried as to how much money I'll be able to save. I'm also not to sure what the tax rate is, if someone could send me a helpful link that would be great.  \nI am also talking to a couple of other companies, but they haven't given me offers yet. I'm still in the preliminary stage of the interview process with them, but this company threw an offer my way and I don't know if they'll retract it if I take too long to respond.  \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I should add that I do speak Chinese, I am of Chinese descent. Part of the reason I'm making a good amount in my entry-level position is because I do speak two dialects of Chinese in a very Chinese-centric market and am able to communicate with clients in the absence of my managers. The reason I didn't put this in initially is because the company I am talking to said they prefer the teachers not use Chinese in the classroom and with the parent because they didn't want parents thinking they were pulling teachers from other parts of China.",

    "text": "I finally called a man out on the bus for touching me So I've always been a somewhat shy girl. I live in a big city where buses can get pretty crowded because of either rush hour or just nearby schools getting let out. Cool. I understand crowded buses; we all gotta get where we're going after all. But what I can't understand is why some men feel the need to take advantage of crowds to feel up other people's bodies.\n\nThe first time I was inappropriately touched was in 8th grade.  \n\nIt was a really crowded bus as the middle school I went to was near other schools that happened to get out at the same time. The bus stopped at one of the main bus station so naturally, many people got off and there was a lot of bustling as half the bus fought their way to the door. I thought nothing of it until I felt someone's fingers roughly shove their way into my crotch from behind. By the time I had turned around, the person was lost in the wave of people getting off. I was literally the shyest I have ever been in my life at that time (was voted the shyest girl in the school that year actually) and so I never said anything to anyone.\n\nThe second time was on yet another crowded bus, a couple years into high school. This old Chinese man was holding onto my upper arm from behind which I was using to hold onto a strap above for balance and I thought it was a little weird but just assumed that he had nothing else to hold onto for balance so I shrugged it off as nothing. At least, until his hand reached down and started grasping at my right boob. Luckily, I was with my best friend this time who had gotten a hold of a seat and squeezed me in with her. The man got off at the next stop. We said nothing except for a few comments of disgust.\n\nThe third time, which happened a year later, didn't really involve me being touched sexually but was more creepy than anything. I was boarding a the bus with the same friend and as I stepped on, I could feel a guy pressed up close behind me. I thought this was very strange as the bus wasn't anywhere near crowded enough to justify that and the man kept this up as we got on until my friend and I were standing holding onto straps for support as we chatted. Now at this point the man had backed off a little, just enough that he was still there but not enough for anyone to go wtf at him. My friend and I were talking quietly about something about which stop to get off at, the man swaying with the bus to casually make contact with my back the whole time. Keep in mind this bus is not crowded by any means; my friend and I had chosen to stand because our stop was nearby. As we got off, the man made a remark, breaking into our conversation about something we were discussing. I later complained about this to another friend and halfway into describing the man, she quickly cut me off and finished the description for me. Apparently the man was hanging out near a mall next to a highschool and had been coming up to highschool girls and trying to give them his number. This was a young blond male in his 20s(?).\n\nA couple hours ago, I was riding the bus home from my old highschool where I was visiting a retiring teacher. It was an extremely crowded bus because the same line ran though at least a couple schools and a few stops away from where I was supposed to get off, I gave up my seat for an elderly man and started standing by the rear exit. Not a minute later, I felt fingers stroking my left butt cheek. I thought it was my imagination at first so I shrugged slightly away only to feel the fingers return. I was 100% sure those weren't some stray bag at that point; those were human fingers stroking from my lower to upper butt. \n\nI was done. I'd gained confidence in highschool thanks to mentioned teacher and I was sick and tired of being touched. I've gotten nothing but trouble from guys in college who just can't take a damn hint. I was called a bitch for not giving them a chance (I have a boyfriend) so I did what I felt was right. I called him out on it.\n\nI turned to him, looked the middle age blond man straight in those sky blue eyes of his and said in the loudest voice I could manage, \"Touch my butt one more time and I will report you.\" I knew I had the right man. He met my gaze unblinkingly and slowly nodded. No one seemed to have paid attention or cared. But at that moment, I was relieved.\n\nWhen I got off, I found out that my sister was on the same bus and had squeezed onto the front of the bus. If she had gotten on the back door, my little sister could have been in my position instead. She could have been the one touched instead of me. And I know she wouldn't have said a thing.\n\nI know this isn't a big deal to many people but I had to get it out somewhere. Thank you for reading.\n\nTL;DR Guy kept stroking my butt, I called him out on it, and my little sister could have been his victim instead of me if she had gotten on the back door instead of front.\n\nEdit: Ahh thank you! I honestly only expected a few upvotes and a comment or two perhaps so I was honestly surprised when I came back... And only one nasty PM to boot! Thank you so much! \n\nEdit 2: Holy...thank you for the gold! I had to refresh twice because I couldn't believe my eyes... Thank you!\n\nEdit 3: To those wondering, seeing something like this happen and speaking up to either the culprit or just getting attention to that happening would be amazing. Silence is not golden in this case.",

    "text": "What job should I look for next with 5 years sales experience while I finish my degree? Hey guys, basically I am a college senior but I will need another year and a half to graduate because I have held a full time job my entire university career.\n\nMy background is mainly in bicycles. I have worked at three different bicycle stores in my life and have done everything from box boy, sales associate, assistant manager and there was a brief period of me managing while they found a suitable replacement.\n\nMy other experiences are teaching in camps and centers for children and working as an English teacher in China.\n\nMy strengths are for sure sales and just communicating with people in general. I have been told they like having me around and I bring a positive vibe. I speak fluent Hungarian and am also intermediate level in Chinese. My current major is international business with minors in finance and mandarin.\n\nI was wondering what jobs I should look into and what companies you would recommend I apply for while I finish up university. I could go back to the bike shop but I feel I am not learning anything from that anymore. I have recently spent 6 months in China and will return in December, then I will start a job search for the spring. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nI was looking into being a car salesman because I thought that might play to my strengths and is kinda similar to bikes from what I have been told, but I dont know.\n\nLet me know what you think! Thanks!\n\nEdit: Super weird wording on my part. I currently live in China, and I will move back to New York in December to finish my university. Sorry about that.",

    "text": "29, How do I transition from China focused sales to a different sector? I'm 29, American, about 4 years work experience.\n\nBachelors in Political Science, Masters in East Asian Studies, both from decent state schools, top 50. Grades were decent, 3.33 undergrad, 3.87 graduate, though they could have been better. Full time work and studies don't go so well together. All my academic studies were geopolitical and financial system focused, with an emphasis on China.\n\nAs part of the bachelor's and master's degrees, I spent 2 academic years in China. Then worked there in the education marketing field for a British company for another 2 years. From this, plus the academics, I speak fluent Mandarin, and have a strong understanding of Chinese culture.\n\nI came back to the US, and used my small savings to start a company. It had initial interest from some investors, which spurred me to really give it some serious thought, but the investments fell through and I poured my savings into it thinking if one investor showed interest, another must be interested as well. Didn't work out that way.\n\nAfter that folded, I spent 6 months or so scraping by and applying for jobs constantly, and fell bassackwards into a position. Initially I thought it was a short term consulting role where the owner of a small manufacturer in the Chicago region wanted me to accompany him as a \"spy\" on a business trip to China with him. Things sort of escalated quickly and I took a full time role as the China regional manager for this smallish company out in the boonies south of Chicago. I told him that this wasn't what I was looking to do longterm from the outset, and agreed to help him reform his businesses China operations. I spent one year doing this, found new dealers, renegotiated the contracts, fired the deadweight, stopped the dirt, redid the Chinese marketing materials, and hired on some long term talent to take over and trained them up.\n\nAfter one year, I shifted over to a part time position, as sort of an on call consultant, in addition to whatever else might be needed, because I was going to go back to school for economics. I did not, sadly, get accepted to the programs I applied for. I applied for \"Ivy League\" level European Universities, because I already have a master's degree, and I don't think it makes a lot of sense to get a second unless it comes with the networking potential of a top tier school. Thus I'm in a pickle. I have a year before the next intake for schools, with no guarantee again that I would even get in. I have rent to pay, and zero interest in continuing in my current job.\n\nI've been doing China, nearly exclusively, for almost 10 years now, and I need to branch out. It's lost it's allure, I don't enjoy it. I want to get into financial consulting, or management consulting or geopolitical analysis, or even journalism, something that is more generalized. I don't have anything against doing something that involves China in some way, but I do not want to do it exclusively anymore. I've been applying for Business Analyst, Financial Consultant, Global Strategy Analyst, Risk Analyst these types of positions, through LinkedIn in the Chicago area for many months now. I haven't had any responses though, can't seem to get through the HR filter. The only interview I had was in October, for an exclusively China focused position in Washington, for $43k a year which I didn't take. I'm not sure where to go from here...",

    "text": "My company is running an incredibly insecure production environment while holding millions of sensitive and personal documents. They will not listen to my consult on securing the system. What can I do? My company is running an incredibly insecure environment on a cloud platform and I have ethical concerns with the data security and how the systems are being (mis)managed. I am a senior plus level developer with complete access. I have brought these issues up with executives and management over the past 2 years, and nothing is being done. A few obvious risks our system contains:\n\n- All logins to the SQL database are stored in plain text. These SQL logins are full sysadmin. We have off shore development teams that know the login information because these logins are in nearly all of our configuration files, of which they have access to as they are able to RDC into the production servers and open them up. In fact, I've caught some of them using the logins in order to circumvent the limited access we have setup for their Windows credentials. The engineering director was aware of this when I caught this happening, and did nothing.\n- All Azure blob/Amazon S3 accounts and keys are stored in plain text. Again, these accounts and keys are stored in configuration files that can be accessed by more eyes than we probably even realize. These storage accounts contain sensitive and personal information/documents. All it takes is for a malicious individual to grab hold of the account and key, and press “Delete.” Active replication/geo-redundancy is not a thing here.\n- Windows Update has not been ran (including security patches) in over a year. I understand patching Windows Updates and ensuring application stability incurs additional resource time, but my company is not taking any efforts to implement proper procedure for patching the servers at a regular interval.\n- Our servers are open to the internet and are being brute forced as we speak. Proper Windows RDC 101 should be to require a VPN to access application servers, especially your SQL database servers. Instead, every single one of our servers is completely open to the internet. Anyone with a login is able to connect from any part of the world without a proper audit trail. This isn't even exclusive to our Windows Servers. We have Linux servers that have remote root login enabled, and is seeing endless failed login attempts. Each day there are roughly 40,000 failed attempts to every one of our servers, primarily from Chinese IPs that are directly linked to known botnets.\n\nMy company is not short of funds to hire proper system administrators, or an expert security consultant that will analyze our system and assist with its flaws, or allocate development time towards securing the system even at these most basic levels. However, they refuse and ignore my (and other's) pleas. They funnel resources into new development of new products that are over a year before being release worthy, all the while these items remain untouched and have been untouched for years.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of our data and the sphere in which we work with, I have great ethical concerns with how they are selling this product (especially considering our contracts have bogus \"security\" clauses that state we have robust \"intrusion detection systems\"). All it would take is for one person to become malicious with the database, storage account, etc., and hundreds of millions of incredibly sensitive/personal records would be leaked or lost.\n\nI have sent yet another plea today to my executives and management, but I am sure it will be met again with apathy. Has anyone faced this type of issue? I do not feel comfortable with how my company is handling system security, and I fear that it is only a matter of time before the system is compromised (assuming it isn't already.)\n\nWhat can I do?",

    "text": "Should I report about racial stereotypes that go too far? Please i need advice? Hello cscareerquestions. Longtime lurker and finally made an account to complain about my possibly shitty situation. I just want readers to keep in mind and tell me in the end if I’m overreacting or am I actually being mistreated. I really want to believe I’m overreacting and I feel like I’m going crazy over this. \n\nTL:DR: I’m currently facing some less innocent stereotype jokes by an employee and I don’t know whether or not I should let it go or not.\n\nSo I work in an IT department that has a software team under a Canadian (Toronto area) company that does research. I am myself a young male Canadian-born Chinese who recently started my career as a software developer. Most of the stereotypes I’ve witnessed upon myself are very innocent and I play along and genuinely laugh. However, I have this one senior lead (who is White and from a commonwealth country other than Canada) and overall he’s a great guy and a great leader. He sometimes likes to use stereotypes a bit too much. A good amount of them time are innocent and I’ll play along or just not respond at all if they’re a bit more on the offensive (ex. Looking at a bunch of resumes and seeing a common last name like ‘Patel’ and saying hey that’s (another employee’s) brother)\n\nHowever, this one thing really got under my skin and prompted me to come here looking for advice. He wanted to know my “real” name and was being very persistent. I politely told him my parents gave me my western name first but it wasn’t enough for him. He even went to get other people to nag me about it who thankfully didn’t want to participate. He proceeded to try hard to annunciate his wife’s (who is also a Canadian born Chinese) and laughed. He’s a pescatarian who loves animals and loves to comment on a lot of the times when I’m eating something with meat and has also made some comments about me being a meat eater and being Asian. I feel like his wife just lets him have free reign on stereotypes but he should know not to have the same amicability to everyone else. That is probably what plays a huge part in his own mind that he can use Chinese stereotypes so frequently. My perception of him now makes me think he likes to make everything about my culture a joke and has somewhat of a superiority complex over i\n\nI really want to keep this job and has great benefits and a great pension and the other people I work with are just splendid. However, my contract ends in August with a chance to go on Full time with the benefits after that. My manager (who is also white) is a great teacher and mentor to me and the only thing he has ever asked me about my background is ‘What is your ethnicity’. My manager and I really get along and he knows I do a good job.\n\n However, I don’t know whether if I should make a complaint about this senior lead to my manager because what if he sees this as a nuisance to deal with a workplace problem that is related to racial sensitivity? The senior lead and manager are close professionally but not sure personally so I don’t know how to approach this. All I can think about is that if I make this complaint, am I going to be looked at as a problem? What if letting me go after my contract is the easier thing to do because I made this complaint? Does this also make me look bad if I’m trying to apply for another job and I say I complained about because of racial discrimination?\n\nSorry for the long post!",

I just can't seem to figure out the basics of this front-end JS framework that my company made over 10 years ago. It works really well actually (the output on the product looks pretty sleek). However, the code is a mess, there is no documentation. I can't even understand the lifecycle of the components. Javascript can be quite unstructured, and it seems like the guys who wrote this went crazy with this.\n\nThe second youngest guy on the team has been there for 3 years.

    "text": "Second job out of college. Turns out I'm not as decent as I thought. Please help. Long story short, I killed it in my first job for 3 years and sailed into my second one about five months ago. I thought that, while I'm not a star programmer, I can get by.\n\n\nThis is a little long, but please at least skim it. Please, please help me.\n\n\nMy first job had a much smaller, less geographically-spread team. We used agile. Our code base was in decent shape. We had unit tests. We had documentation. Apparently this is enough to keep a shitty dev from imploding.\n\n\nMy second job is almost the exact opposite. It's getting out of control.\n\n\nFor example, I literally have no ability to test certain parts of our application. I can't explain why without ruining my anonymity, but it is literally impossible. I have tried everything I can think of. Even though I've told my manager this, I still get tossed problems on these parts of the stack. So I navigate blind. And fall flat on my face.\n\n\nIt doesn't help, either, that they have me all over the place, meaning I'm struggling to get acquainted with the more arcane parts of some of our apps. In particular, they like to throw me into a problem without (a) introducing it to me via a ticket or whatever, (b) explaining what they're trying to accomplish, (c) explaining what's not working, (d) telling me how to reproduce the problem, and (e) giving me time to get oriented. If I ask, they might send me a ticket and a link to an API call. Today was especially heinous, as the app they threw me on is one I've barely touched since I started and they wanted a fix a million years ago.\n\n\nThere are no tests anywhere. Our documentation is a mixture of Chinese and German. We have eight+ code bases, all of them in various states of disrepair. One of them continues to grow, with no one paying any mind to maintenance, and with some controllers you just scroll and scroll and scroll until your eyes glaze over. Then you have to start from the beginning again. Any attempts to clean this up is like shoveling shit against the tide. There are so many broken windows nobody cares anymore.\n\n\nSome of our codebases are so old they're practically legacy. Guess who's stuck completely rewriting one of them? Which would be great if it weren't for everything else I'm dealing with. I have a ton of things due at the end of the month and have barely touched any of them because it's always something. *There is always some kind of interruption, problem, explosion, etc.*\n\n\nThere are no iteration or planning meetings of any kind. Tickets pour in at a breakneck pace, are assigned to developers, and often fall into the abyss unless there's a deadline attached. And even then some tickets just. . . get forgotten.\n\n\nManagement is on the other side of the country. Half my team is about 100 miles north of me. The rest that's here at the office are on front end only and I do back end.\n\n\nWe are required to switch contexts so frequently and so quickly I swear to god I have whiplash. As soon as I get absorbed in *anything*, something else comes up. Trying to block out a couple hours of my time each day for these tasks and ignoring them otherwise does no good--my manager Slacks/emails me, or a coworker comes up to my cubicle.\n\n\nAll of the above puts me in a blind panic. I can work quickly, and I can learn even a crappy codebase, but not like this.\n\n\nThe only \"win\" I've gotten so far is rewriting a snarl of a small project to be more up to date with latest practices and technologies. I had to spend hours of out of work and on weekends to get it done and I'll have to spend *more* to deploy it. The last time I tried to deploy something during work hours, I botched it because people kept interrupting me. No amount of begging or pleading makes it stop.\n\n\nThis isn't an ideal working environment, obviously, but if I was a truly competent developer, I would find a way. I *want* to be a competent developer. I *want* to find a way. It's important to do so because we all know that this isn't even as bad as it gets!\n\n\nWhere in the world do I start to unravel this situation? Do you have any suggestions on how I might manage the chaos better? Changes to my work style that might be helpful? Anything to make this more bearable.",

It's difficult to explain, but students learning sometimes seems to be the last thing on the directors and owners mind.

    "text": "My company is running an incredibly insecure production environment while holding millions of sensitive and personal documents. They will not listen to my consult on securing the system. What can I do? My company is running an incredibly insecure environment on a cloud platform and I have ethical concerns with the data security and how the systems are being (mis)managed. I am a senior plus level developer with complete access. I have brought these issues up with executives and management over the past 2 years, and nothing is being done. A few obvious risks our system contains:\n\n- All logins to the SQL database are stored in plain text. These SQL logins are full sysadmin. We have off shore development teams that know the login information because these logins are in nearly all of our configuration files, of which they have access to as they are able to RDC into the production servers and open them up. In fact, I've caught some of them using the logins in order to circumvent the limited access we have setup for their Windows credentials. The engineering director was aware of this when I caught this happening, and did nothing.\n- All Azure blob/Amazon S3 accounts and keys are stored in plain text. Again, these accounts and keys are stored in configuration files that can be accessed by more eyes than we probably even realize. These storage accounts contain sensitive and personal information/documents. All it takes is for a malicious individual to grab hold of the account and key, and press “Delete.” Active replication/geo-redundancy is not a thing here.\n- Windows Update has not been ran (including security patches) in over a year. I understand patching Windows Updates and ensuring application stability incurs additional resource time, but my company is not taking any efforts to implement proper procedure for patching the servers at a regular interval.\n- Our servers are open to the internet and are being brute forced as we speak. Proper Windows RDC 101 should be to require a VPN to access application servers, especially your SQL database servers. Instead, every single one of our servers is completely open to the internet. Anyone with a login is able to connect from any part of the world without a proper audit trail. This isn't even exclusive to our Windows Servers. We have Linux servers that have remote root login enabled, and is seeing endless failed login attempts. Each day there are roughly 40,000 failed attempts to every one of our servers, primarily from Chinese IPs that are directly linked to known botnets.\n\nMy company is not short of funds to hire proper system administrators, or an expert security consultant that will analyze our system and assist with its flaws, or allocate development time towards securing the system even at these most basic levels. However, they refuse and ignore my (and other's) pleas. They funnel resources into new development of new products that are over a year before being release worthy, all the while these items remain untouched and have been untouched for years.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of our data and the sphere in which we work with, I have great ethical concerns with how they are selling this product (especially considering our contracts have bogus \"security\" clauses that state we have robust \"intrusion detection systems\"). All it would take is for one person to become malicious with the database, storage account, etc., and hundreds of millions of incredibly sensitive/personal records would be leaked or lost.\n\nI have sent yet another plea today to my executives and management, but I am sure it will be met again with apathy. Has anyone faced this type of issue? I do not feel comfortable with how my company is handling system security, and I fear that it is only a matter of time before the system is compromised (assuming it isn't already.)\n\nWhat can I do?",

I was also told by my boss that he is thinking about potentially bringing on someone else at a director level to see how I felt about that and I said I was open for anything though this has me worried about my position I’ve only been here 3 months. There is a senior accountant that works with the company for 15 plus years and a lot of the team including myself look to this person for council if we are unsure about anything I can’t really get my team to look to me for leadership when this senior accountant is always the fallback resource. Any suggestions from my fellow accountants on what I should do or should I be concerned? I feel I might be out of a job in a month or two.",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "[F27, UK] Wannabe journalist. Disabled, highly qualified, can't drive. No career progression opportunities. Where should I go? I work as an administrator for a national charity in the UK and, since applying for a part time job to support my MA (Japanese), I have remained in the same 18 hour job as I have been for the past 3 years.  I am paid the UK 'living' (a.k.a. minimum) wage of £7.50 per hour, meaning I live off around £7,000 per year and the occasional food bank during Christmas. I have qualifications outside of my MA and 8 years of positive working experience, with some really good references from organisations I previously volunteered/worked for.\n\nI fulfill my duties every day on shift promptly and to a high standard.  I also try and create jobs for myself while I am working. Nevertheless, I am also very skilled copywriter, and although that's not my job (I am just an Admin Assistant on paper)  I get frequently approached by the PR managers and journalistic types in work on how to do jobs, which is something I am happy to do, and I get a lot of positive comments about my work.  Never have I turned one down as that's ultimately what I would love to be - a journalist.  And I am great at that - I have wrote plenty of articles for our website that have generated 12 times more positive hits than our usual articles.\n\nI know it's ridiculously competitive; that's why I have done a plethora of courses both inside and out of work to try and refine my skills. That's not what scares me.  What I find frustrating is how when I try and apply for opportunities within and outside of work to progress (or even create my own opportunities), I get told that my career choice is 'unrealistic' because my disabilities would 'limit' me greatly.\n\nThe context, I guess, is this:  I have a disorder which impairs my peripheral vision, meaning I can't track travelling items or judge their speed.  I have tried driving lessons before and although I know perfectly well how to get a car running, I cannot track other people's behaviour well because of it.  I am also a lady with Asperger's Syndrome and, although my work would never know this one, I also have PTSD. Neither of these two stop me from doing my job in the slightest, but I have been subject to discussions where people say 'because you have Asperger's, you don't understand'.  \n\nIt's frustrating! Argh. Furthermore, any attempt to suggest avenues for further training typically gets turned down because 'it's not relevant' to my job. \n\nI would understand if I were a bad employee, but the reality is, I am not when I think about it.  I volunteer my time constantly, I take on new challenges.  A bit like that person you know in work who just cannot say \"no\".  I have been told by these same people that I am an 'ideal employee', yet...\n\nI know it's time to leave. I don't feel valued and I know they either cannot or will not allow me to develop into a positive role for them, which is a shame because I know I would be useful.  My question is, where to?  What kind of jobs in journalism (or fields related to journalism) would even consider hiring someone outside the capital who cannot drive? \n\nDoes anyone out there have any connections, ideas or suggestions?  Even some constructive criticism?  I know that at times I can miss the bigger picture, so if anyone out there can give me any kind of clue, even if you think it's harsh, please tell me!",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "Romance is dead There is a widespread misconception that women are hopeless romantics.   Turns out it's the other way around.  \n\n>So let’s start with how men and women score on the most well-known measure of romanticism, the Romantic Beliefs Scale.2 This questionnaire asks people to rate the extent to which they agree with statements like, “There will only be one real love for me,\" “If I love someone, I know I can make the relationship work, despite any obstacles,\" and, \"The person I love will make a perfect romantic partner; he/she will be completely accepting, loving, and understanding.”\n\n>The researchers who developed the scale have found that, on average, men outscore women\n\n[Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/close-encounters/201408/whos-really-more-romantic-men-or-women)\n\nAlas, the dual assaults of feminism and globalization are leaving huge numbers of men with no romantic prospects.   Why?   Because despite what feminists initially claimed, hypergamy doesn't suddenly disappear when women achieve financial stability and increased social status.   \n\n[Article](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-men-are-having-problems-getting-married/) from CBS notes:\n\n>That meshes with the problems facing younger American men who lack college degrees. In 1990, more than 17 percent of men between 18 to 39 worked in manufacturing, but by 2007 that had declined to about 11 percent, Autor and his co-researchers found. Fewer job opportunities reduce “the supply of young men who would likely be judged as **good marital prospects**,” they noted. \n\n>It’s not only that young working-class men are less marriageable when jobs dry up, but that some of these men are actually disappearing, the paper noted. \n\n>Where are these young men going? Many are turning to risky behaviors such as heavy drinking and drug use. Trade shocks are leading to higher mortality rates for young men, which explains some -- but not all -- of the imbalance. Young men are also disappearing because they’re incarcerated, homeless or migrating to other areas to find better job opportunities. \n\nSo in other words, working class men are doing horribly.   \n\nBut not to worry gents, just as feminists are determined to create gender equality in the political and legal spheres (cough), they are doing their best to help working class men achieve decent employment and therefore a chance at having a happy relationship.   Oh wait...\n\n>A \"man-cession.\" That's what some economists are starting to call it. Of the 5.7 million jobs Americans lost between December 2007 and May 2009, nearly 80 percent had been held by men. Mark Perry, an economist at the University of Michigan, characterizes the recession as a \"downturn\" for women but a \"catastrophe\" for men.\n\n>Last November, President-elect Obama addressed the devastation in the construction and manufacturing industries by proposing an ambitious New Deal-like program to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. He called for a two-year \"shovel ready\" stimulus program to modernize roads, bridges, schools, electrical grids, public transportation, and dams and made reinvigorating the hardest-hit sectors of the economy the goal of the legislation that would become the recovery act.\n\n>Women's groups were appalled. Grids? Dams? Opinion pieces immediately appeared in major newspapers with titles like \"Where are the New Jobs for Women?\" and \"The Macho Stimulus Plan.\" A group of \"notable feminist economists\" circulated a petition that quickly garnered more than 600 signatures, calling on the president-elect to add projects in health, child care, education, and social services and to \"institute apprenticeships\" to train women for \"at least one third\" of the infrastructure jobs. At the same time, more than 1,000 feminist historians signed an open letter urging Obama not to favor a \"heavily male-dominated field\" like construction: \"We need to rebuild not only concrete and steel bridges but also human bridges.\" As soon as these groups became aware of each other, they formed an anti-stimulus plan action group called WEAVE-- Women's Equality Adds Value to the Economy.\n\n[source](http://www.weeklystandard.com/no-country-for-burly-men/article/17737)\n\nFor a group of people who so often call themselves \"socialists\" they sure seem hellbent on harming working class men.   There is however a silver lining to the death of romance.    Thanks to feminism marriage no longer provides any benefit to men, and on the contrary is an exceedingly risky proposition.   Therefore working class men are ultimately being spared a life of misery.   \n\nStill, being alone is another type of misery.   In one sense men are being freed, but on the other the loss of love is tragic.   Most men aren't suited to monk lifestyles.   They are being forced into this position out of a combination of hypergamy run amok and anti-male laws.   \n\nLest there be any confusion, working class men are not some minor part of the economy.   They are the people who maintain civilization.    \n\nUnless the MRM succeeds, I anticipate that the Japanese herbivore phenomenon will rapidly go global.   It may spread so quickly that people won't even realize what's happening before it's too late.   When I first saw Karen Straughan's video \"Fempocalypse\" I assumed she was engaging in hyperbole.  Now I'm not so sure...",

    "text": "CVS Interview, What just happened? About a week ago, my wife got a phone call from a very enthusiastic manager at CVS to interview as a pharmacist. She told her all these great goodies about the job and how she loves to work with new Graduates and her excitement over my wife's experiences. She said she is especially happy wifey has an RN degree too. She stated she is excited to see her and the interview will be more or less to determine if my wife is willing to hit the ground rolling aka (more of a formality).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few days later the district manager calls my wife apologizing about how enthusiastic the manager was stating that she skipped the normal interview process by calling her first, that he has to call and do a pre-interview and then assign her to a manager/region but she jumped the gun; so he has a lengthy interview with her and he is happy to go ahead with the onsite, saying in his career he has had only 10 candidates out of hundreds that had her dual degree. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nToday she went in for the interview, the manager sees my wife and my wife says her whole body language changed, warmness and excitement went out the window, just cold stoic conversations. The manager said she wanted someone with nursing experience, not someone who just went straight from nursing to college (?), the wife said she has over 4 years of working in various departments (per her resume). \nThe interviewer then said she is looking for specific skills (no elaboration), the wife said she has the basics related to the position from her rotations, and that the interviewer had been previously expressed preference of her being a new grad.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe interviewer then went on to give her potential negatives on how involving the position is (things she knows) suggesting it might not be something she might want. The wife replied that she's more than up for it. \n\nThe interview ended with \"we will see if we want you for another onsite interview\". \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat hurt me the most is when my wife called me really depressed and almost in tears asking me if this went sideways because she was black? Her name sounds Japanese (we are African) and most time people are surprised that the name and voice do not match perceived appearance. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI refuse to believe that this is a reason, I just need help wrapping my head around all this. How did things go so sideways? I always tell my wife to add these people on LinkedIn so that there are no surprises. This is just gut wrenching sad. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**TLDR:** Warm exciting phone interview goes cold on meeting my wife in person.",

What I find frustrating is how when I try and apply for opportunities within and outside of work to progress (or even create my own opportunities), I get told that my career choice is 'unrealistic' because my disabilities would 'limit' me greatly.\n\nThe context, I guess, is this:  I have a disorder which impairs my peripheral vision, meaning I can't track travelling items or judge their speed.  I have tried driving lessons before and although I know perfectly well how to get a car running, I cannot track other people's behaviour well because of it.  I am also a lady with Asperger's Syndrome and, although my work would never know this one, I also have PTSD. Neither of these two stop me from doing my job in the slightest, but I have been subject to discussions where people say 'because you have Asperger's, you don't understand'.  \n\nIt's frustrating! Argh. Furthermore, any attempt to suggest avenues for further training typically gets turned down because 'it's not relevant' to my job. \n\nI would understand if I were a bad employee, but the reality is, I am not when I think about it.  I volunteer my time constantly, I take on new challenges.  A bit like that person you know in work who just cannot say \"no\".  I have been told by these same people that I am an 'ideal employee', yet...\n\nI know it's time to leave. I don't feel valued and I know they either cannot or will not allow me to develop into a positive role for them, which is a shame because I know I would be useful.  My question is, where to?  What kind of jobs in journalism (or fields related to journalism) would even consider hiring someone outside the capital who cannot drive? \n\nDoes anyone out there have any connections, ideas or suggestions?  Even some constructive criticism?  I know that at times I can miss the bigger picture, so if anyone out there can give me any kind of clue, even if you think it's harsh, please tell me!",

    "text": "Careers in Tech for Former Teachers I'm pretty desperate and I'm embarrassed by my lack of experience both within the field of education and outside of it. I've only been a teacher for about a year. I started in one school district that was a mess. Then I moved to a new district which has treated me extremely welldread but I'm still stressed out of my mind. I've pulled about 8 all nighters this past month and I've just overall been exhausted, unfocused, unmotivated, and discouraged by the profession. I had a passion for education but I'm finding more and more that it's not quite the right fit for me. I enjoy working with individual students even if they're struggling but I cannot manage a classroom or deal with non-stop requests from well meaning teachers, administrators, and parents requesting that I take on all these additional responsibilities when I already feel so overwhelemed.\n\nI found that one part of teaching I really do enjoy is finding new tech tools and designing class websites, etc. to create unique learning experiences that allow for self-paced learning. I have some elementary programming experience with android programming, html, css, pho, and mysql but it's truly elementary. That being said I would love to learn but I'm just so consumed with teaching even when school doors are closed, that I can barely find time to further develop my knowledge.\n\nIdeally I'd love to work in edtech, but really any tech/IT related field would suit me for the time being as I'm desperate to make a career change for my mental health.\n\nAnd if anyone knows of any other jobs that accept former teachers with limited job experience please let me know. I'm looking for full time work with a comparable salary and Healthcare coverage.\n\nI'm flexible and willing to learn in order to meet the needs of your organization. I also have some Spanish and Japanese language experience if that would be useful.",

    "text": "Would anyone be willing to share their experience with an ARL program, especially in utah? Hi! I am from Utah, but I have worked in Japan the last 6 years (not teaching English) in Japan. Japan has been a good run for me but now I want to take my family and go back to Utah for a number of reasons. (Lower stress environment, better hours, but also I really love teaching.)\n\nMy father is a high school science teacher so I have always loved science and I have always kept myself very knowledgeable in science because I love it. But I don't have a degree in science nor do I have a teaching certificate. (My degree was Japanese Lang/Lit and Asian Studies)\n\nI am posting this here because I would really appreciate any information and experiences from anyone who has participated in an ARL (Alternative Routes to Licensure) program, especially in Utah.\n\nI especially think I am suited to be an earth sciences teacher and I am currently studying for the appropriate PRAXIS tests which I think I can easily pass after a few months of study.\nI could also easily teach a Japanese class, but I think there is no demand for that, and I would be much more excited about teaching Earth science anyway.\n\nUtah has a huge shortage of teachers, especially science teachers, so (as I gather) if you can get a good enough score on applicable PRAXIS tests you can get in an ARL program and become a teacher even if you don't have an applicable degree or teaching certificate.\n\nObviously living in Japan means I can't just walk on over to the BOA and get information easily. So I am trying to get as much information as I can now as I move forward trying to determine how and if I can manage this transition.\n\nLuckily, I can take PRAXIS tests here in Japan, so I am currently studying for those and hope to take one or two  before the end of the year as a sort of self-evaluation.\n\nI would be so greatful if someone out there who has gone through this sort of process would be willing to share their experiences with me.\n\nI am getting some information from my dad (who is a very successful chemistry teacher), but he mostly just says stuff like, \"I am *sure* you could do it. You are better than that bozo they hired last year. or \"You are so well suited to it.\" etc. But I really am having a hard time getting a good picture of how the overall flow of the system works, etc. The timeline of the whole process, when pay starts, how much support/training is offered, etc.\n\nThank you.",

    "text": "Not sure how to feel about coworkers talking in another language to the extent that it feels exclusionary. Can someone please help me understand if I am in the wrong? Hello,\nI work in a Japanese-American Company. I work with 5 other people in the same office. All of us are in the same department in an open-office environment. The assistant manager and two of the other purchasing agents speak Japanese (one from the US and one from Japan). Conversations in Japanese are very common. Until recently, the last few weeks, it has never bothered me. I have worked here for almost a year now. One of the agents and the assistant manager have been having conversations in Japanese throughout the entire day lately, and I have been finding it more and more exclusionary. I understand wanting to talk in your native language because I can speak French, but I prefer English given the choice. However, both of them have lived in the US for 20 years and are nearly as fluent in English as I am. The worst part of this is I can’t pinpoint why this has been bothering me. They have had conversations in Japanese the entire time I have worked here. A lot of their conversations in Japanese are about issues our department/company is facing, and because they don’t have these conversations in English anymore, I know far less about what is going on than I used to. I know that their conversations dip into their personal lives, and I am actually okay with this part. However, I have noticed a growing rift between the US workers who only speak English (excluding me) and the 2 Japanese employees. They have gotten to where they barely ever talk to each other, and they don’t really respect each other. The Manager of our department being one of those English speakers has made this situation even more annoying. Also, I think it has been bothering me because my own workload has been steadily increasing as theirs seems to be decreasing, according to how much they talk and not work (note:  they also pass a lot of their work to me). I mean these conversations have lasted all day (while they were in the office), and they don’t really do anything else while they talked.\nAlso, I want to show that I am not just bothered by the use of foreign languages. I have friends from several different nations, and when we get together, we talk in several different languages together.  Most of these friends speak languages I do not know, and it is fine.  For example, we’ll be having a conversation and someone will say something in Arabic, then someone will kind of explain to the non-Arabic speakers what was said if anyone seems curious. Another example, a group of Spanish and English spearkers, and French and English speakers talking in all three languages together. The Spanish and the French can be loosely understood by both groups due to similarities, so English is used when people are unsure of the exact translation or when someone wants to be sure everyone understands what they say. Two of my friends may say something to each other in their mutual language and not explain it to the group because it was an obvious aside and not really important to the whole group. Or even a work example, our department is all talking together, and there will be both Japanese and English in the conversation but everything is being explained to everyone involved. These are the sorts of situations I am used to, and I have no problems with them because everything is out in the open if need be. There may be languages being used that don’t get explained, but it isn’t something that is important. \nSo, their conversations have been distracting for a multitude of reasons, and I am not certain how I feel or how I should feel. I want to work for the UN one day, so I feel like I should learn how to just be okay with this. I also see the real affect it is having on our department. There is also the point that they are spending more and more time at work not working (and they have very important jobs). I can’t tell if I am being petty for wanting them to stop talking in Japanese as much, or if I am in the right to think that they need to work harder to try to communicate in English more often. I also can’t tell if I am just being spiteful because of the increased workload for me from doing their stuff for them. Can anyone offer any advice for this situation?",

I always get to a certain point where things just don't click, and I don't know how to make them click.\nMy favorite subject in school was Math, I absolutely love Algebra. I always did well in Biology as well, but I never pursued it as a serious interest. My least favorite were English(god I hate English), Geometry, and Chemistry(had a hard time understanding).\nI have taken a few of those online career test. I've gotten Actuary a few times, Bioinformatics Scientist a few times, Data Architect, some other things that didn't sound as interesting. I was looking into the Data Analyst / Scientist career.

I just get stuck.\n\nSo, I'm not sure what I should do, and I reaching out to the community for some insight or assistance, or whatever information you might be able to give me. Thank you so much.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI've tried many things in life that didn't stick, and graduated with a General Studies degree (Concentrations: Japanese Language and Culture, Computer Science, and Computer Information Systems). I enjoy working with computers and researching. I also love math and don't mind biology type sciences. I don't mind programming, but always get stuck at a certain point. My personality type is INFP, but I'm not a huge fan of working with people (counseling, teaching, etc) although I could. A few suggested careers I've gotten from test sites are Actuary, Bioinformatics Scientist, Statistician, Data Architect, and Data Analyst. But I am hesitant about these due to programming issues.

I just get stuck.\n\n\nSo, I'm not sure what I should do, and I reaching out to the community for some insight or assistance, or whatever information you might be able to give me. Thank you so much.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\nI've tried many things in life that didn't stick, and graduated with a General Studies degree (Concentrations: Japanese Language and Culture, Computer Science, and Computer Information Systems). I enjoy working with computers and researching. I also love math and don't mind biology type sciences. I like programming, but always get stuck at a certain point. My personality type is INFP, but I'm not a huge fan of working with people (counseling, teaching, etc) although I could. A few suggested careers I've gotten from test sites are Actuary, Bioinformatics Scientist, Statistician, Data Architect, and Data Analyst. But I am hesitant about these due to programming issues. Thank you.\n\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like to know about me, please ask. Thank you.",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

    "text": "About to rent apartment from BF's parents but it has turned into a complete circus. Hi, just looking to you guys for any opinion on the matter!       \nSo, moving from SC to NYC and next door to my boyfriends parents who are renting our apartment from the owner. We are paying rent money to his parents as they've paid 6 months in advance to the owner.       \nSC wages are much different than NY, and $2500 a month for a 2 bedroom apartment is astronomical to me. So, naturally, just to protect myself, I wanted to take a look at the rental agreement. I'm actually mentioned in it but never signed anything. It's just business right? Well, the boyfriend's parents are deeply offended and think that if I truly loved/trusted my boyfriend that I should trust them too, and also because I met them one time to judge their character. As far as I'm concerned, they're still strangers to me, I don't know them. They could fuck me over in a heartbeat, who knows?           \nI said that I would not move into the new apartment without getting to see the agreement. So they're taking this very personal and have now said they will not allow me to look over the rental agreement until I present to them 2 forms of ID (license, passport) because, to them, \"If you don't trust us with the lease, we don't trust you either - that you are who you say you are.\" \nI'm completely dumbfounded. Seems petty because they know exactly who I am. Like what could I be, Milli Vanilli? $2500 is a lot of money and I just want to protect myself and know that they're not making money off of me, and just know the legal aspects of all this. Am I missing something and they're being reasonable? What do you guys think?       \nAn Aside: Cultural differences are likely playing a part as well. They are first generation Korean and I'm southern white.",

    "text": "Looking for general career advice from people who have worked abroad. What was it like re-entering the job market in the states? How do employers view candidates with overseas experience not related to the job? Worked in China for about 15 months teaching english to children which was really fun, networked a ton, paid off about half of my student loans, now I am in Korea. Just got hired as a University professor outside of Seoul and would really like to take this year to develop a skill such as becoming fluent in either Chinese or Korean. Mainly because I love communicating with people and I think it would be a beneficial skill to bring back to the states once I decide to return. I mainly came to Korea because my moms family is from Korea and I wanted to learn the language, but I find myself busy with school and I think I would learn the language better if I was enrolled at a Uni! So far, living in Korea isn't really what I expected as far as culture and community. Many Koreans are a bit judge mental and I think Korea has less opportunity than China when it comes to learning a language. I did get an offer at a University in China and the offer is still on the table but the pay is much less, but they did say that I can audit Chinese classes and they will provide me with a working visa. Prior to working abroad I have about year experience working at a PR/Marketing firm doing event coordinating. What jobs can I really look for when I want to come back to the states? I wouldn't want to work in the teaching industry in the US.. Do companies see working abroad as a plus for candidates? I am 26 going on 27, have about $10,000 in student loans and think I think if I stay with the Uni job for a year I can pay off all my student loans by the end of September 2017.",

    "text": "Boss from another culture is making work miserable, but the difficulty of finding more work makes me feel trapped. tl;dr - Korean boss is a huge energy vampire, doesn't know anything about the industry we're working in, watches us through security cameras and makes inappropriate comments about women. Pays me barely above a living wage for a job that's so stressful I can't sleep or enjoy the rest of my life.\n\nSo I started recently (just shy of four months ago) a job as a marketing manager for a small independent mobile game publisher.\n\nI had been looking for a job for a while, was super stressed out as I was pretty much out of money, and all the people I usually did freelance work with had nothing for me or stopped calling.\n\nI got this interview after applying for a copywriting position, thinking I'd mostly be dealing in app descriptions, PR, etc. I made a rookie mistake, after briefly discussing what I thought were the job duties, he asked my salary requirement. I was afraid to go too high and drive it off, and gave a number. He noted it. Then he starts adding extra stuff—turns out he wanted an office manager that would also handle all sorts of other stuff. And like a fool, I said nothing about wanting to adjust my original figure to account for these additional duties.\n\nWhen he offered me the job a few days later, he actually beat my asking price by a few thousand dollars a year, and it worked on me *again*, making me feel better even though I knew I should have held for more.\n\nWork starts, and at first it was alright, but over time it's become a near nightmare. He said he wanted to foster a creative environment, but he constantly asserts himself into our pipeline—most notably by taking ads I'd written and filmed (or that our animator animated), and adding weird stock footage and framing the ads for things they were never meant for. I told him as such, but he basically dismissed those concerns.\n\nThere have been other strange occurrences that just put me off: he used to frequently mention hiring \"attractive females\" to sit across from us to make the place more interesting. He has lost his cool on several occasions over minor issues—we released our first game and the metadata didn't match the update I'd put in. He has a fit, saying it needs to be fixed immediately, it's an emergency, it will all be ruined. I tell him it'll be fine. The game released minutes ago, no one has seen it, no one has downloaded it yet, and a mobile game's success isn't contingent on a pristine first hour. He doesn't yield in the least, he starts calling our international dev team into the office at what was their one in the morning to try to get things fixed. He blamed me at first, until I showed him that I'd updated the information correctly—turns out the dev team had given me the wrong account information. Still, it doesn't foster much loyalty.\n\nDuring a meeting in which we were discussing international publishing targets, he mentions that the game was a failure in Korea (where it was developed), despite having (according to him) over $500,000. When I asked how that's not a success, he said it's because more than that was spent on the game. I told him the costs seemed far too high for a game of our scope—typical budgets should have been 10-20% of that. He straight told me I didn't know what I was talking about and to be quiet. I looked up mobile budgets for projects similar to ours...I was a little low, but was closer to the mark than he was.\n\nI battle with coming in daily. It's a small team—only four of us, including me and the boss, and it'll be three after he tells our contact animator not to come in anymore (with no notice, I'll add, I know it's coming), so there's not a lot of action or buzz around the place. The energy is notably higher when the boss isn't in.\n\nBUT on two separate occasions as of this morning, he's sent a text to an employee while he was gone that indicate he's *watching us through the security cameras*. Today he texts me asking where the animator is—the dude had just stepped out for a smoke break, nothing to get so riled up about. The previous time he sent a message to the only female that he \"liked her dress\". It was deeply disconcerting.\n\nNow, he's from Korea, but has been in the States for some time. I know there are cultural differences, but I'm losing sleep and hair for a $35k/yr job that has a mean salary almost twice that (albeit for slightly larger companies). I can't enjoy my Sundays—knowing that Monday is coming sends me into depression.\n\nBut looking for work is somehow worse. People say I'm lucky I have a job while I look, but it's starting to feel like the only reason I got this job was because my boss has no idea what he's doing, and was able to sucker me in with shady business tactics. I've applied to several jobs a day for the last two weeks, with two rejections and no other responses.\n\nThe other complicating factor is that he promises more for me soon. There's a six month probationary period built into the contract, and he has frequently requested that I don't ask about wages and the like, because he wants me to be the Face of the company in the States, and to help build it together, and that once the six months is up, I'll be \"compensated accordingly\". I want to believe that, but he's all but outright lied in the past—so I don't know how reliable that is.\n\nAm I just incapable of being happy with my job? Should I stop worrying so much? I'm looking for more work and am appreciative of what I'm learning here, but I feel like I'm losing years off the end of my life as a result. I've been hoping at least to get another offer so I could leverage it against my current stuff and either have an out or get enough to make it worth staying. But nothing.\n\nSorry, I know I'm rambling. This has been building up for quite some time. I'm not the only one in the office that is feeling this way, either. Both the other team members have told me they've considered leaving because of the environment.\n\nWhat should I do with him? Would it be worth losing the job to bring it up? It's all so complicated.",

    "text": "I'm healing from an abusive relationship with a narcissist that ended 2.5 months ago. I could use some advice.. or simply an ear. Hi everyone. I don't really have anyone to bare my heart to right now. I want to send this out to the universe and see what comes back. I would love to hear your perspectives.. whatever corner of the world you're in.. whatever life path you've walked. I really appreciate all your voices and Reddit so so much. I'll try to keep it condensed and simple. \n\nI dated a narcissist for eight months. He was incredibly cruel and selfish but hooked me with rare very special moments of revealing a deeply hurt.. damaged.. wholesome.. helplessly pure childlike heart. He would verbally and emotionally abuse me but sometimes with time, he would realize how hurtful or selfish his actions were. With sincere tears in his eyes he would apologize and express that he's learning and wants to change.. express that his cruel actions and words are purely from ignorance because even his own mother never showed him any love, open-heartedness, gentleness, morals. \n\nIt doesn't come as a surprise.. he experienced a horribly abusive heartbreaking childhood. He used that excuse almost always. And being an empath.. my heart opened and poured for him, I wanted to love him more. Help him see all women aren't money hungry and out to lie and cheat. Show him it's okay to open and be vulnerable. My upbringing wasn't perfect either. I honestly felt we were both \"breaking\" our cycles of hurt from the abuse and neglect our parents created. (My family was very poor growing up and my father abandoned my mother, sister and I when I was 12.) He always said such amazing things about growing old together.. building character through experience.. being there for eachother.. building a life and family together that's strong and confident (him) but sensitive giving and loving (me). He would say I am the best person he's ever met with character he values most above anything. That I have changed his life forever in all aspects of his life.. work. And I was learning a lot about patience, understanding, and forgiveness. No relationship is flawless and flatlined. I appreciate and value rolling with the punches of life. Struggle is what makes you grow.. its what broadens and builds your mind and heart, I love that. And I love the idea of a life partner who is down to walk the sometimes mountainous path of life with you. I appreciate open-mindedness and the will to adapt. Effort is so beautiful. Anyway.. I honestly believed we could awaken together.. Live more and more with awareness.. and mindfulness.. and learn together. But I was wrong. He would do things like tell me his ex was exceptionally beautiful.. she was a professional model.. but I'm pretty. His other ex is very smart. But I'm definitely not smart. I'm talented and creative. But not smart because my brain is not wired to be a coder or engineer. This is one of the most painful parts. I stayed with a man who fought me and defended himself for the right to call me stupid.. many times. He would tell me my problems are trivial.. that he doesn't care about my pleasure.. several times he would fuck me and just roll over. I would silently cry in the dark and masturbate next to him as he snored. We fought so many times about our sex life. It was always selfish and only about him. There were times I would be very ill or very drunk and he would just go ahead and fuck me.. even when I'm barely conscious. I would just lie there in the fetal position. He said that was one of the great things about me.. \"I never left him wanting.\" He was so proud that he's slept with 120 women. He told me I was the first one he gave eye contact with when having sex. And he said he typically didn't kiss the girls he'd sleep with. That I have no idea how much he's changed. I brought this up so many times.. that I want to make love.. sex should be us sharing how we feel physically.. it's about both of us..and he just didn't care. He would say sometimes sex is just carnal and sometimes he needs to be a man and take it. It's just about him. I never once orgasmed in the 8 months we dated. He never tried. It was always for him. He went down on me maybe 3 times in 8 months. He blamed it on me. He said some women aren't confident or comfortable orgasming in front of people. He would say some girls orgasmed as soon as he put his dick in them. Typing this out I know it sounds fucking heartbreaking and pathetic. I know. If I heard all this from my sister or if my future daughter were telling me all this... I would be utterly mortified and devastated for them. Sometimes it's very hard to see unobstructed reality when you're struggling in the middle of everything. He would fall asleep after I drove 22 miles to talk about how he's hurt me as I am crying next to him in his bed. He once dropped me on the side of the road with all my luggage to take an uber home after a road trip when I said I wanted to go back to my apartment, not his. \n\nHe has a very unhealthy relationship with sex. He was once over 500 pounds but with sheer will.. starving and lifting he lost 230lbs. From age 30 to 35 he overcompensated by \"fucking and conquering as many women as possible doing whatever it takes to make them comfortable\" His greatest fantasy is rape. He would often tell me his greatest \"id\" fantasy is to kick down a door like a Viking and violently rape a wife as his defenseless smaller frightened husband is forced to watch in horror. (My ex is 6'5) He used to \"jokingly\" say rape victims often orgasm because in a subconscious level they loved it. He would joke and say 50 shades of grey is about him.. and there's a reason why that franchise is insanely popular. Women love and want to be raped on a cave man level. He absolutely lovess the new Westworld for how brutal and fetishized rape, pleasures, violence, dominance, and indulgence is. He would often say when he looks around and thinks about it.. his character and life is similar to most leaders. The greatest leaders he knows arent emotional, overly caring, sensitive, \"squishy\" or giving. Superstar singers.. athletes.. businessmen like Steve jobs.. world famous video game designers.. they all have one thing in common. They \"lick the earth\" as he would put it.. and they dont hold back their id-driven desires. That is the source of their greatness and inspiration, especially as an artist. Being a sensitive \"squishy\" ..That all seemed so empty to me. \n\nHis dream is to have a line of hundreds of women waiting their turn to be fucked.. he impregnates them and doesn't take care of the babies. \"Like a Viking king\" He often said sex is a need. If he doesn't have sex in two weeks everyone starts to look like meat. He doesn't care. Men and women alike. I tried to understand the root of this manifestation. It was horrifying to hear but in all these stories.. all I saw was this nerdy obese kid who was ignored all of his life... a guy who was so ignored that he lost his virginity to a prostitute... this poor 7 year old boy who would be locked in his room for days by his horrible stepfather. His cries ignored by his cold mother to ensure her loans are paid by this new man. It all screamed suffering and heartbreak. Especially because I personally know several women who have experienced rape and I have been volunteering with The Rape Foundation for several years. I really tried not to judge. How can you.. life is crazy and sometimes devastating and sometimes you dealt difficult cards.. like your parents. And humans are capable of such cruelty.. a lot of times they genuinely think they're doing the right thing. We also got into many painful fights about his views on having children and marriage. He said he would absolutely test the blood of his babies. That was a deal breaker. I would explain how hurtful that is. He would say its not about me. It's statistics. Women will lie and have men financially support children that are not theirs. (This is what his mother did to his stepfather. When his stepfather found out. He began to abuse my ex from a very young age.) He also said 80% of women initiate divorce for the payday. So if marriage was a deal breaker he would consider \"many types of arrangements\" with the help of his lawyers. \n\nAnyway.. 8 months we dated. He made me cry 1-3 times a week. But when things were good we were both adventurous.. incredibly playful.. tender.. driven.. and affectionate. We both love similar music and movies. He would sing to me.. we loved going on long drives and talking about life.. this existence.. our hopes and dreams. We are both class clowns. But one thing was rawly clear. We were cut from different cloths. He's a big tall trump loving white guy from Texas who always lived in a big house.. no student loans.. went to art school.. atheist.. first job was after college for a video game company.. etc. I'm a Korean American from the east coast who was raised by a struggling single immigrant mother.. have had at least one job since high school.. lived in my car in NYC.. put myself through college thus have student debt (this was a big issue for us.. he said for him to even consider marrying me.. I would have to get rid of my debt. I'm the first one in my family to go to college).. insatiably curious about spirituality.. religions.. philosophy, the human condition. I am such a sensitive giving tender hopeless romantic easily hurt squishy. And he's just a confident iron fist, force. His mother and the rest of his family believe vulnerability and feelings equal weakness. A few times he was very vulnurable and shared how when he get married and starts a family, he plans to stay away from his family because they are all a very certain way. \"poverty mentality\" is what he would call it. He would share how his mom never cared.. and still doesnt care about his problems when he tries to open up to her. One time when he dumped me he said.. his mother is so strong she has never cried ever in his life. And I cry all the time. He would resent her for her hard coldness but I don't think he's aware of how attached and proud he is of her. He'd laugh and say \"my mom is a tempest. Shes the boss of the house, what she says goes, she gets her way, she's dominant she's fierce. She's a force.\" He would express how the other girlfriends he introduced to his mom were shredded apart and would end in tears going up against such an intimidating woman. I see right thru all that. His mom holds a tremendous amount of guilt. He never once talked to her about how her abandoned him while his step father would abuse him and lock him up. For days he would sleep on a bare mattress.. starve..  and go to the bathroom in the room. He said he became obese because of this feeling of having absolutely no control and not knowing when he'll eat again. It's so heartbreaking. When he got older his step dad and mom sent him away to a military school for delinquent kids. He would be locked in his dorm for days as well. He would beat kids up and created a group of friends that he \"protected\". Multiple times he told me about a very feminine kid who would massage him in exchange for his protection. My ex would explain if they locked him up in his dorm for a few more weeks he would have absolutely fucked that feminine kid. My gut tells me he did a lot at that school that he'll probably never tell anyone. \n\nI see thru all this. He and his mom have taught eachother to pretend like nothing happened. This is their way of comforting eachother.. pretending like it went away. As a woman.. as a super sensitive aware woman.. I know she's holding a lot of guilt and sadness. She's created such a tough persona she can't get herself to let it out. People will live a lifetime running from feeling. \n\nMy ex is incredibly charismatic to his coworkers and he's loved and well known at work. Many shy guys at his video game company idolize him and his ability to sleep with many women. He's this fearless jokester who is \"untouchable\". He is very proud of the fact that he hit the \"jackpot\" being born a tall white confident man. He has absolutely no one he's responsible for except for himself. Im very close to my mother and sister and when my parents divorced I pretty much stepped up and felt responsible for keeping the three of us together. Since high school I started to help financially support our family. He couldn't understand that. He'd simply say it's very good of me. \n\nAnyway..\nWe are such opposites and we knew this from day one. I was WAY too giving. I paid for amazing vacations because he had never snowboarded.. snowboarding was my life from middle school to college. I always drove to his place in Santa Monica (22 miles away from my place and my work.) I always planned amazing adventures.. things he's never done in LA. He surprised me with a candle lit dinner once. The first three times we ever went out to dinner was my idea and I treated him. He used to say I am the balance and light that will melt the ice and softened the thorns around his heart. I remember one time he was just in awe. He didn't own any plates or cups so we went to target and I got him some essentials. He said he had never been treated or cared like this. In the beginning, he did hand draw me pictures of me which was really touching. He had flowers sent to my work. Once after we fought and once after I stayed with him while he got a gal stone removed. He used to say he had never spent money like this for anyone. He used to never even buy girls drinks before taking them home. So many times I told him. I don't care about the money spent. Pick a dandelion for me. Let's share a mcdonalds apple pie on the beach. It's the thought care and effort that is so special. He just never got it. \n\nHonestly as the days pass and I continue to practice Shambhala meditation, contemplation and mindfulness.. I see I was YEARNING for that strong eternal male energy love... the love of an unconditionally loving caring father that I never had. He broke my heart 1-3 times a week for 8 months, honestly my heart and gut knew it was very wrong. But my yearning to fall in love.. to GIVE the love I hope to receive.. and the yearning to settle down blinded me. I gave the love that I wish to receive. Even though my ex didn't deserve it. The biggest lesson I am walking away with is why did I stay for so long. That's where I am going to learn and grow from. That's where my self love needs to focus on. Believing in someone.. believing in hope.. believing in good and forgiveness are all wonderful things but there needs to be an unbreakable boundary where my self respect and self worth isn't brutalized. And I need to have self love and strength to walk away. For good. Even when they're crying, apologizing, explaining, or making the most beautiful promises. \n\nThe very last week we spoke. I texted him in the morning after fighting the night before. He bit my head off about bothering him at work. I went silent after that. After several hours he emailed me explaining he fucked up and when he gets emotionally overwhelmed he doesn't know how to deal. He said he loved me.. loved what we've built.. that I am a ray of sunshine he has been able to capture and he will never give up. He said he was going to come over that night to fix things. \n\nI was so exhausted and broken.. I couldn't get myself to respond. I just didn't get it. Me caring.. me reaching out being affectionate.. texting him to see if he's okay.. all of that to him was nothing but an annoyance and a horrible burden. If you have so many excuses against it.. and so much aggression and aversion against it... why be in it? How can I apologize and be sorry for burdening you with my affection? Poisoning your life with my love? \n\nAfter getting no response for 5 hours he texted me. \"Actually I'm not coming tonight. I'm seeing other people.\" That was it. After a few days. I emailed him a couple times that I deserve a proper phone call break up. He unblocked my number and finally called me. Immediately he just unloaded his anger. He blamed everything on me. He said I have a personality disorder and as my friend he was begging me to get help. That everything was in my head and that I cry for no reason. He said he knew from the first week of dating that I was the problem but he felt bad for me and was tired of hopping from one girl to another so he stayed with me for 8 months. He said he is tall.. confident and white.. he makes a shit ton of money and he loves his life. He said \"I simply have TOO MANY choices.. our connection wasn't special at all and I will love again\" He said he had already fucked someone new and she is \"very sweet\". He went on a date with someone and \"she is fucking awesome\". I stayed on the phone as he said every single thing a hurt desperate person would say to try to convince himself that's he's okay.. he's in control.. he's not hurt.. and he's right and strong. \n\nWe often talked about the five love languages. He always said he only needs physical touch. And I need all five which he thought was crazy. I stayed on the phone with him as he described all the reasons why this new stranger he slept with was better than me. How her only love language is touch as well. He emailed me on Monday saying he will never give up, and by Thursday he had slept with someone new. As I listened to all this.. it finally clicked in my heart. That was it. All the hope and forgiveness and empty promises broke in me. He finally cut the remaining karmic tie between us. This was never about me. I was never going to make this guy happy and we were never going to work. All this horrible cruelty he was yelling into the phone... was his internal dialogue convincing himself that he is right, he is okay, he not hurt, he is not responsible. Having no control.. or being accountable for selfish hurtful actions causes him to lash out. He has such a fear of feeling things.. of getting hurt.. or having no control that he rather live a surface level life and cushion himself with yes people and agreeable circumstances that make his life easy and unchallenging in anyway. Control everything.\n\nThat, believe it or not is the shortish summary of my last 10 months. There are so many other examples and details but I have a feeling you guys get the picture. \n\nSo here I am today. It's been an up and down road to healing. Today my close friend sent me articles on the toxic relationship between empaths and narcissists. I am SHOCKED how accurate and to the T these articles capture our relationship. Our relationship was EXACTLY like how these articles explain it. Honestly... I wish fate would send these articles to him.. I even contemplated having my fiend or my sister email them to him. Is it wrong of me to care about his happiness and growth? Care about him opening his eyes to the destruction he's creating? Is it wrong of me that I don't violently hate him? I feel sad FOR him. I feel no need for relief by cursing him and saying cruel things. I have no need to fill any voids by sleeping with people and saying \"OH I am SO over him. OH he was horrible and I can do better.\" Life is vast and life is crazy. How can I condemn and judge anyone? That's just not me. You can't control certain cards you're dealt... like your upbringing. But you DO have the choice in how you live on from these experiences. That is what I do choose to examine. I wish him bravery and strength.. I wish that for anybody and everybody. I wish that for myself too! I'm working on it everyday. Strength to see myself and life without any veils. See my actions without any self deception. (Deception like cushioning your ego.. focusing on blame which is so empty and pointless.) Fear from not knowing what's gonna happen.. fear of having no control.. it's instinct to protect yourself. Your ego will protect itself with all kinds of destructive momentary relief (empty sex, alcohol, saying mean things to people and putting others down, etc.) I wanna see things for what they truly are. Be brave enough and have the wisdom to walk away when you know it's wrong and not meant for you. \n\nIs it wrong of me to hope that he'll learn the true root of happiness? It's not money or sex with hundreds of beautiful women. Or telling yourself how confident and awesome you are. How many people know you. (From the years of isolation.. all he did is draw alone in his room. Now he is a somewhat well known video game artist and director at a major video game company in LA.)\n\nLiving a full life is about living awake.. how much you open yourself to the world. How much you give and share. Vulnerability is true bravery and strength. Not cushioning your life with ease and agreeableness. But I realized.. who am I to force a lesson on anyone. Who am I to \"make\" someone wake up or realize things. Even if he were to have a.. \"shit.. now I see\" moment.. it takes consistent drive and desire to be awake and mindful... it takes time to change your habits. I just wanted to know what you guys think. Thank you for reading. I may be hurt and heartbroken but I am SO thankful for this experience. I think these lessons have really opened my eyes and I'm coming out stronger and a lot wiser. You definitely can be too open... too giving.. and too forgiving. \n\nhttps://dailyoccupation.com/2017/03/14/toxic-attraction-empath-narcissist/\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201201/the-highly-sensitive-person-and-the-narcissist?amp\n\nAs the time passes I rawly see how completely lost I became. I lost myself and completely forgot who I am and what I'm worth. I became a deeply desperate and sad person. Everyday I yearned for the small crumbs of kindness and affection he would strategically give me.. especially in the form of verbal affirmation: telling me I'm the love of his life and he will never give up. But then check me by ogling and comment on women's bodies while we're out.. and keep me down on myself and insecure. He is truly manipulative with his words which in this world can take you far. It's rewarded. He was always very proud that he could get what he wanted.. especially with women. I also rawly see that how you treat and speak to others is a true reflection of how you treat and speak to yourself internally. If someone is so easily and freely able to be sooo mean and cruel to another living breathing FEELING human.. how is their internal dialogue with themselves and their self worth? \n\nThank you so much for the wonderful comments and messages. I cannot express how moved I am. Its even more special because we are all anonymous strangers yet we are all so interconnected in how we feel and the hardships we face. I am so thankful. I choose to take this painful experience and life lesson and continue to explore myself.. love myself... open myself to others.. and love. \n\nHe texted and emailed me a few weeks ago. He wrote:\n\nText:\nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay.\n\nEmail: \nIt's been hard without you. I hope you're okay. Sorry for how things went down. \n\nI couldn't respond.",

    "text": "Hijab and Black Lives Matter: white in-laws pissed... advice? Long time lurker on this sub. Not sure if this is the best place for this, but I've seen other posts with great advice from this sub and you guys have already been very helpful. Black Lives Matter and wearing a hijab are two issues affecting women across the country, and the big women's march on Washington (and across the world!!) was SO INSPIRING. As a young woman, these issues and many more are affecting me every day. I have a daughter, and I want to be part of the movement that makes the future BETTER for the next generation to come. \n\n----\n\nI just moved in with my white, Italian-American in-laws who think of themselves as totally-not-racist individuals. (Spoiler alert, they are racists.) \n\n\nThey are Trump supporters, support the Mexican wall, support the travel ban aka Muslim ban, and more. But this isn't about \"politics\" this is about morality. I am not a democrat. They often vote democrat. We are not pushing political party agendas here. When you inquire further- and don't let them get away with vague phrases but push for them to say what they really mean- they can say some real doozies. Like that \"white people/culture is inherently better.\" Or that they \"don't want to help those in need if it takes away from our own kind.\" Although they'd never word it that way by their own choice, they admit these thoughts when backed into a corner. And yes they did use those exact words when you make them face it. \n\n\nI'm much more progressive and liberal, myself. (Surprise!) But they ARE open to having some passionate debates with me. They think I'm smart, thoughtful and kind and will occasionally concede their point to me. We've been going at it since the inauguration, right around the time I moved in. They secretly love the arguing and so do I, but I'm still deeply concerned. \n\n\nWhen we discuss these issues, I genuinely hope to bring new information to the table to change their minds and sometimes I do. (Yay!) We all can influence our social circles no matter how big or small the impact may be. \n\n\nAnyway. Today I got a Black Lives Matter t-shirt in the mail. I needed an oversized t-shirt to wear with my new leggings, and I knew this would be a conversation starter. I often wear t-shirts about my beliefs (like \"some chicks marry chicks\" which they have no issue with.) First thing out of their mouths before I even tried it on were: \"Why would you wear this, you're a white girl. You're not even dating a black guy.\" And of course, \"All lives matter.\" \n\n\nWe discussed it at length today and I told them tomorrow I am going to wear this shirt at dinner (I'm making dinner that night), and ALSO a hijab. (There is an invitation for people to try the hijab for a day in solidarity with acceptance of other cultures, although, I still will criticize religion and oppression don't get me wrong, but this is about tolerance.)\n\nThey are so upset. Don't worry, they also love it. We are very respectful on both sides. Like I said, on a certain level they enjoy being challenged. I'm not in any danger, and I won't lose my home or anything like that. But they did say that they wouldn't eat dinner at the same table as me if I wore either item. My plan is to let them sit while I stand in the kitchen, however, I know they will invite me to join as well and then they will stay too. At least, I think they still will, we are just going to get into some heavy (good) conversation. I hope I can encourage them to open their world view. \n\n\n**So, this is why I need your help... can you please help \"prep\" me for some common questions/rebuttals etc. about BLM, and \"anything related to a hijab\" which could honestly be anything from left field considering they aren't super informed on these issues despite having their strong opinions.**\n\n\n(Another example, TRIGGER WARNING RAPE, my mother in law was on a jury back in the day for an alleged rape, and the jury --and judge!-- forced the alleged victim to remove her hijab to testify so they could \"better tell if she's lying\".) \n\n\nI have a decent grasp on the basics, but I want to bolster my \"ammunition\" of statistics, articles sources, examples, memes, etc. They have this idea that the black community, and pretty much any minority, hasn't contributed anything as a whole \"like us whites.\" They say, \"how come on the news it's always blacks and immigrants committing crimes and killing one another.\" \n\n\nTHE FACT THAT THEY DO NOT SEE THEMSELVES AS RACIST IS THE MOST DANGEROUS, CONCERNING PART TO ME.\n\n\nThank you in advance, fellow women. And men. And non binary folks. You all rock my world. \n\n\n**Tl;dr: Please help me handle black lives matter and racist issues in general tomorrow at dinner with my in laws. Thank you!**",

Several companies I worked for caused me to quit without notice. \n\n1) a new restaurant in town: boss was vulgar and when i texted him i was quitting he faked apologized and said I was a part of the gay jokes he was making as a condition of employment. (violation of EEOC) He also pretended to fire me several times. The pay was crappy as well. $30 for an eight hour shift of doing nothing.\n\n2) a casino: i was here for 6 months, there was this really bad manager and when it started slowing down she was showing her true colors. She got several girls to write a false report on me and then told on me. I was so wrapped up in the drama/retaliation I got myself fired.\n\n3) a mexican restaurant: there were several employees here who were really mean to me and would not cooperate. I told my boss about it and one of them flipped out, so I changed positions. The other apologized but didn't mean it, then continued to be abusive towards me, pushing me around and doing everything herself. I had two jobs at this time, my sleep schedule was messed up and I started being late when I was nearing the 3 month probation end. So I ended up quitting without notice.\n\nAs you can see, I have both physical and mental reasons for walking out the door without a warning. Did I do the right thing? Because I have 3 other jobs where I did put my two weeks in. All managers were nice to me. \n\nI'm just worried if I change my mind in the future and would want to return to these jobs or future employers would have the stink face about it.",

    "text": "Can a young man of 23 years of age with a criminal past and poor credit possibly have a brighter outlook for a future career? (Heads up, it's a bit of a read) So I'm a 23 year old male with a criminal record. I was once a very good kid and In fact enlisted with the us marine corps, 3.6 gpa in highschool and in great shape at the age of 18 before I spiraled into becoming a depressed, drug addicted young man quickly getting arrested for multiple marijuana charges, resisting arrest, and a controlled substance charge. I lost my chance with the marine corps, I haven't held a steady job until about 10 months ago I was hired at chipotle Mexican grill after sitting in jail for 6 months on a burglary of habitation which I'm now serving 6 years deferred adjudication with the possibility of getting off early. I've been doing what I can to meet all requirements of my probation and I'm actually close to finishing most my financial and community service aspects of my probation within my first year. I'm doing well currently at chipotle and recently received good news that I'll soon be a kitchen manager. Despite how well things are going now I can't help but feel depressed that I have nothing accomplished by now, and I feel like my future career in whatever I may study for in college will be hindered by my criminal past. I have a credit score of 560 with many medical bills that have gone into collections already. I don't want to continue struggling like this and I'm trying to find the best possible route to a better future. I know there can't be one \"fix it all answer\" but I'm asking you guys that may have a better insight to my current situation on how to go about with my current life situation and college. What could I even possibly study given my history. I know I can get my record sealed but that would be 5 years after I successfully get released from my felony probation. Any help? I'm glad to answer any questions to clarify.",

I just had a chance at a second interview for a job that would have been a significant increase in salary and probably have some wide exposure within my industry.  In all respects, this should have been a great position that I'd have jumped at immediately- did jump at, actually.  \n  \nUnfortunately, the step after the initial interview was a personality assessment questionnaire.  One of those navel-gazing things where you're asked to answer on scale of Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree whether or not you brag about your personal accomplishments, whether or not you want people in your organization to do better than you do at tasks, whether or not you like working in an environment where nothing stays the same... If I answer Strongly Disagree does that mean I don't have accomplishments, hate my fellow employees, can't handle change?!?!?  \n  \nIn the immortal words of Sweet Brown, ain't nobody got time for that.  \n  \nI politely let the company's recruiter know that I was no longer interested in the position and wished them the best in their candidate search.  \n\nIs it reasonable to consider these things as a \"reverse personality assessment\" where I gauge the suitability of a potential employer by the criterion \"I often can't judge my candidates' character without a psychological questionnaire\" being answered \"Strongly Agree?\"",

    "text": "I was raped on Wednesday and I just needed to write about it a little Why am I so focused on insignificant things? Why am I so bothered that I have to leave my favorite pair of thrift store jeans on a piece of paper spread across the bathroom floor? They cost me less than ten dollars and they were starting to get loose around my hips anyway. Why do I care when the detective and her partner take my bedsheets away in a brown bag? I got them with a coupon at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and the thread count wasn't even that high. Why do I fear that my nurse will judge me when I mention to her I dyed my pubic hair purple a few weeks ago after she clips away several strands? Why do I worry that calling the strawberry Zofran tablet I dissolved under my tongue an antiemetic will make me seem too knowledgeable about a process I've never been through? Will they think I'm lying because I circled around the parking garage a couple times across from the police station instead of just parking in a handicap spot right out front? Will they tell me it's too gray to proceed with charges? I had told him ahead of time that I didn't want a relationship or sex. I told him that things were moving too fast and I was still in love with someone else and I wanted to be celibate for the next year. I told him all of this before we met and he agreed that we should just be friends. And still he came through my door and hugged me and later said on the phone that I gave him mixed signals because I sat down on my bed. I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. I wasn't trying to send any signals. He started kissing me and I hadn't even looked at his face yet. So he kissed me and I kissed him back even though I didn't want to. And he slipped his hand under my shirt and grabbed my breast and asked me to take my shirt off and I did. And he gnawed on my left nipple piercing and I looked at him for the first time and felt disgusted. And my pants were off and I can't remember how they ended up down at my ankles. Did he do that? Did I? He's biting at my stomach and touching me and licking me and I don't want this. I keep turning away and he asks me why I won't look at him and why I'm hiding my face. I tell him I'm shy because I'm scared if I tell him I think he's repulsive he'll get mad and sometimes when men get mad they hit you. Sometimes when men get mad they kill you. So I just roll over and lift my comforter over my face like a child watching a horror movie. His pants are off and he's standing on my bed looking down at me and I feel small. I don't want to look at his body. He doesn't look like the person in the pictures he sent me. He doesn't even appear to be the nationality he claims to be. He wedges himself between my legs and tries to fuck me and I tell him no and I'm so proud of myself. And he's says \"ok\" and I'm relieved. I explain to him that earlier in the week that things got out of hand at a photoshoot and I slept with the other model and even though it was consensual it wasn't something I felt good about. And he seems like he understands and he says he's sorry about that and then he asks when I'd last been fucked prior to that. I keep turning away. He holds me, spoons me like we're some couple and not strangers that met less than half an hour earlier. And he's touching me again and I feel his fingers near my vagina and then suddenly his fingers are gone and his fucking dick is inside of me and my body slumps like a scruffed cat. I'm lying there, I'm a body, just a body, I'm frozen, he's thrusting into me and I can't believe this is happening and he tosses my body around like I'm not even a person underneath all this flesh. I don't know how much time passes. It feels like a minute or two. He doesn't ask me if I'm okay or if I like this or anything. It's like I'm not even there. And finally I'm able to speak again and I say \"I don't want to do this\". He says \"do you not like me?\" and I can still picture his fucking pathetic face when he asks me this and all of a sudden all I can do is cry and repeat \"I don't even know you I don't even know you\". He says sorry and asks if I want him to leave and I say yes and then he insists that he's going to take me somewhere and I tell him to leave. He asks to use the bathroom and I give him permission and he leaves my house and before I can even get up to lock my door he rings the bell and I realize his sunglasses are on my dresser. I'm wrapped in my comforter and I hold the glasses through the crack in the doorway. Why the fuck do I offer him such courtesy? I shut the door and run back into my room and cry and I want to scream but I don't because I think if I start I'll never be able to stop.\n\nYesterday, the day after, I bought a white pages account and looked up his phone number. He had never told me his last name, just his first name. It turns out it wasn't even his real fucking name. I thought he didn't look Spanish and it's because his name is Pakistani. And when you Google his name it looks like he got married a little over a month ago. He's a rapist and a liar and a piece of shit and I'm so fucking angry.",

    "text": "What was I supposed to do when I see a lady in distress? I didn’t know where to post, but here we go.\n\nI am a married man with lots of ladies in my family (wife, sister, cousins, mother, aunts). I know ladies are routinely subject to catcalling and verbal harassment. Where I come from it’s a common practice that anyone around should stand up for any lady who is subject to such crap; it’s a social norm. I moved to the US a couple of years ago, but something happened today and I wanted to understand how such things are dealt with here.\n\nToday after having a bike through a park during the lunch break I noticed a young lady at the exit of the park who was clearly in distress. I saw a pickup slow by hear, then move out and the driver seemed to be laughing/waiving at the lady. It just didn’t seem right to me. So I stopped and asked her if she was OK or if she needed any help. She just didn’t respond to me clearly so I got closer and asked her if she was OK, then she just started saying stuff about her cousin/looking for someone/if I know her or the driver, I couldn’t really understand. My English isn’t bad, but I just didn’t understand her. So I asked her what to repeat what she was saying and that’s when she became very agitated. She stared calling me a creep/to leave her alone. She just didn’t seem OK/coherent. So I asked her if she was OK or if she needs the cops. I had seen the exact same behavior once from my sister one time when she was mugged in broad daylight a couple of years ago, and I understand it can be frustrating, but I just didn’t know what to do. At that time I just felt I might be misunderstood or even accused of harassing her. I just didn’t know what to do. Luckily, a park authority pickup just passed by at the same time and I thought I would better leave her -as it might be interpreted that I am harassing her- and they would be better able to judge if she needed help. \n\nI just felt threatened. I didn’t know what to do. I just had through my mind the thought that a brown, alien guy over a bike being shouted at by a lady is just the stereotype of a scumbag harassing a lady, and I just felt the urge to run away although I just wanted to help. I don’t really know what to do if that happens again. I don’t want to be the bystander who lets shit happen because it’s non of his business. What was I supposed to do?",

    "text": "Experienced a ton of sexism and racism in South Korea and need to vent You'd think this was a more appropriate post for the country's sub but, having read so many ~~white men~~ people there apologize for racism, I thought the sexism aspect would at least be appropriate here. **TL:DR at the bottom.**\n\nIt's probably my fault for not reading up on the 'bad' aspects of Korean culture, but I don't know many people who look for those things before visiting a country that has a modern-looking society. Being half Asian the racism and sexism I receive from my mother's homeland is minimal and tolerable. At 5'8\" I stand out. My plain features, brown skin and lankiness draw judgement because 'mixies' are meant to be pale and have more Anglo features. My bad. \n\nAnyway, my stay in Hong Kong and Taiwan was dope. So much to see and so much good food to eat! Shopping was cheaper than back home. Nice. The last leg was South Korea, the source of my mother's beloved K-Dramas and my opportunity to see snow for the first time. What I actually experienced was the opposite of dope. \n\nIt started as I got off of the plane. By far I was the tallest woman there. I stood near the exit and three people approached from behind whispering. I turn around to face my friend and the group glances at me with an audible sigh 'oh, negro'. It was a shock to hear someone refer disdainfully, out loud, to a person as negro. I wondered if they were seeing people who had dark skin or were African (American) around. When there was no person with brown skin other than myself close by I jumped to the conclusion that they might be talking about me and judged based on my features - big lips, booty and wide-ish nose. I dismissed it as me imagining things. \n\nThe next day I was in Meyongdong, a big tourist area, near my hotel. We rushed about and it was packed with stylish people and all the cheap makeup and street food we wanted. As I got bored I tuned in to the crowd around me. So, FYI, the locals LOVE to stare and make comments about foreigners in Hangul, and if they really want to speak their mind a descriptor or two in English as you walk by. By the time I made it back to the hotel I'd been called Japanese (called, not asked) and Chinese and Americano (anyone who can speak English) and... ni**er, once. I saw an African family on a train later with such miserable looks on their faces that I wondered if they were getting the same treatment.  \n\nNow sexism and internalized-mysogyny. Going in I knew Korea has impossibly high beauty standards and I was not exempt from judgement; not that I could hide given I was taller than most people as well as having brown skin. I believe women did not like that I was tall and thin as that is a huge ideal and the vast majority are smaller than 5'8\". Two other girlfriends who were with me have typical Asian height and features and were mostly ignored. Men especially didn't like that I was tall. Contrary to reports, Korean men did not appear any taller to me than other Asian men. So while women laughed as I walked by and grabbed their boyfriends to drag them further away, men got aggressive, like intentional shoves in crowds and 'tch-ing' as they would walk past. Old men turned around after seeing me as I approached. If I stood next to them in a crowd they'd move elsewhere. A kid walked by and called me a giant monster as his parents smirked. It was bewildering how frequent and constant this behavior was. Almost everyone I walked past was laughing or giving dirty looks. Even people some distance away. Christ. By the end of my 2nd day I tired of what was happening and concluded this was top of the range sexism and racism. [I Googled this shit and found that I wasn't alone and the issue is swept under the rug.](http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1221602) [Open discrimination is not legislated against and foreigners complaints are dismissed](http://www.koreaobserver.com/nearly-all-foreigners-victim-of-discrimination-in-seoul-29001/). Great. Also found out that speaking English when not white invites scorn for being a snob and 'better' than Koreans, which they mocked me for too. Another layer of bullshit to deal with.\n\nOn the 4th day I had enough and stayed in my hotel. It was great tbh, but my travel companions who had typical Asian appearances thought I was crazy. I was fine with watching action movies all day instead of looking at the ground to try in an attempt to hide myself.\n\nBy the 7th day I was willing to face the music and go on the DMZ tour, which was amazing, then I had dinner and it was back to the bullshit. I decided to go out for the remaining couple of days anyway as I had recharged my spirit staying in the hotel and wanted to see what I could, which was a bad decision. I only remembered Gangnam was the capital of superficiality once I saw all the plastic surgery ads in the train station. Walking around there the laughs were louder and the men yelling 'You're a big girl!' was just enough evidence for my friends to start believing me. \n\nBy the end I was emotionally worn down. I was happy my flight was early morning but the abuse from other Korean travelers continued until I got off the plane in Singapore. The biggest irony was sitting in the departure lounge as a Korean woman walked past with a bag that said 'RACISM' with a cross through it. If I weren't so demoralized I would've laughed. \n\n**TL:DR - Beware of rampant, open, sexism and racism in Korea, and by all means do not be brown, tall and female. People defend Korea's nationalist monoculture and say 'you just have to deal with it' but you'd think there'd at least be some tiny courtesy to keep the racist and sexist comments quieter. Even sadder is that it's being taught to children. I don't hate Korea, it's a beautiful country, but I wish their culture did not foster so much ignorance. For *anyone* visiting there you'll need something tougher than thick skin.**",

Rather, it comes from a judge giving a speech to some attorneys almost 40 years ago whose source has, to date, not been identiﬁed or confirmed.|\n||\n|It is not inappropriate to suggest that it is time we move forward and away from the citation of this figure to more contemporary and reliable scientiﬁc data.|\n||\n|**Published Research:** There has been some research specific to the area of falsely reported rapes, resulting in published figures ranging from 8 to 41%:|\n||\n|**1.** MacDonald (1973) provided false report rates for 1968: they were 18% nationwide and 25% in Denver, Colorado \n||\n|**2.** Greenfield (1997), quoting US. Bureau of Justice Statistics, provided a nationwide false report rate of 8% in 1995 and 15% in 1997|\n||\n|**3.** Brown and colleagues (1997) conducted research to address the issue of genital injury in female sexual assault victims presenting to the San Luis Obispo General Hospital emergency room in California between 1985 and 1993. Their study revealed a false report rate of just over 13%, involving women who ultimately removed themselves from the research being conducted|\n||\n|**4.** Kanin (1994), in his study of an unnamed Midwestern city in the United States, revealed a 41% false report rate.|\n||\n|**5.** Kennedy and Witkowski (2000), in their attempt to replicate the Kanin study in a suburb of Detroit, found a false report rate of 32% between 1988 and 1997.|\n||\n|**6.** In April 2002, Her Majesty’s Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary published ”A Report on the Joint Inspection into the Investigation and Prosecution of Cases Involving Allegations of Rape.” The report revealed that, out of 1379 cases studied, 11.8% were false reports.|\n||\n|**7.** Lea and associates (2003) gathered data in a constabulary in the southwest of England from 1996 to 2000, They revealed an 11% false report rate.|\n||\n|**8.** Jordan (2004) studied police rape and sexual assault files in New Zealand The study revealed a false report rate of 41%.|\n||\n|These numbers, while varying by location and year, combine to suggest that false reports of rape are not rare, but common. The authors are not suggesting that these numbers be used predicatively to infer that false reporting is more or less likely in a given case. Rather, we are suggesting that **this illustrates the need for due process and impartial investigations in cases of alleged sexual assault.**|\n||\n||\n|*John O. Savino; Brent E.

    "text": "Unprofessional Boss I have a super unprofessional boss, and IDK what do to about it. She is one of those people who have been at the company for a long time, so logically she would be promoted to a managerial position, but that doesn’t necessarily mean she is a good “manager” if you get what I mean. \n\nI’ve worked here for over 2 years and I’ve never had a performance review or a discussion about where this job might be going for me. I’ve also brought up a few tweaks I thought our team could make that would make things better for everyone on the team, but she always shuts me down and insists we continue doing things the way we’ve been doing them. Also, one time I asked her for help with dealing with an aggressive coworker, and she looked at me in complete shock (like she just got electrocuted), and she said “I don’t think I can help you with that, maybe you should just talk to him yourself.” She’s utterly useless. \n\nOn top of it, we work in a small satellite office in Dallas (of about 5 people), and the main office is in NYC. Because her boss works out of NYC, I personally feel like she takes advantage. For example, she’s rarely shows up to our own office. She’ll let us know on the day of that something “urgent” came up and now she has to “work from home.” It’s almost every day that she has a new excuse; I honestly don’t know how she comes up with so many random and creative excuses (my cat seems sick, I think my house is infested with termites, my credit card was stolen, my A/C broke down, I have to pick my friend up from the airport, etc.)  And then, because I can tell from the instant messenger system our company uses, she is literally only “online” and on her computer for about 3 hours of the normal workday. \n\nFirstly, this bothers me because it’s just the principle. That she thinks she’s special and doesn’t have to work full hours like the rest of us, but probably gets paid like twice as much as we do. Secondly, this bothers me because she makes me do some of her work. In a normal situation, I wouldn’t mind helping my boss out, but it bothers me that she’s out gallivanting throughout town, while I’m at the office ALL DAY EVERY DAY doing her work, especially when I have a full plate of my own work as it is. \n\nI’ve brought up the fact that I and my other teammates seem to be drowning in work and how we thought we should hire more employees. The head boss in NYC said no, and insinuated that it was a budget restraint. So now it also bothers me that the company pays her however many dollars to work like 3 hours a day, so we don’t have the budget to hire real additional workers that we need. \n\nI feel like all hope is lost because she is such a brown noser to the head boss and I don’t think he would ever fire her. Our company as a whole is pretty small so we don’t have a real HR department to complain to. \n\nI’ve been actively looking for a new job for 8 months, but I haven’t landed anything yet, which is super discouraging. So, now I’m even more hopeless because I’m literally stuck with this horrible boss. I can’t simply quit because I need the money. \n\nTL;DR My boss is unprofessional, but there is no way to get her fired. I’m not sure what else there is to do. I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been looking for 8 months and haven’t landed anything yet.",

I ended up turning it down, but for some reason the recruiter insisted on doing the negotiations, and I'm nearly 100% sure that my actual salary requirements didn't make it to the company until the point where I turned down the job.  I'm also convinced that this resulted in the company itself seeing this as a money grab from my end.  The kicker is that the HR manager told the recruiter that had we \"gone in with this at first\" she thought they would have just offered it.  Conclusion: Fuck this recruiter.\n\nAnyway...It's been over a month since they offered me the job.  The job is still open, I know they're having trouble finding someone; the position is 60 miles from any major metro area and for the right price I was willing to drive it 3 days a week, but I imagine that there aren't many others, and especially not at the senior level I'm at.\n\nWhen I turned it down with the recruiter, I also sent a \"don't burn any bridges\" email to the HR manager, just mentioning that I feel like my requirements weren't accurately communicated and that it was my first time negotiating for a position through the recruiter and I was unfamiliar, etc.  I wished them luck in their search, and said I really liked the team and hiring manager, nose as brown as can be, yada yada.\n\nI know I'm the first they offered it to, I even know I'm the first they brought in for an interview.  I am the most senior person that was presented to them by the recruiter which does the majority of the placements with this company.\n\nMy question are:\n\n1. What are the chances the company might circle back to me if they continue to not find anyone?  \n2. At some point does their contract for this position end with the recruiter and what are the possible pit falls of going around them and coming back to me?\n3. Is that something that can even possibly happen, or is it a pipe dream?",

    "text": "I'm a Confused and Scared Virgin Convinced She is Pregnant. Please Help? Hi everyone. I just found this website a week ago and I have been spending a lot of time reading up on threads and such to get familiar. I think this is the place to be asking questions and getting advice for these sorts of things, but if not, could someone please point me in the right direction?\n\nI'm a 21 year old college student, and I feel like the universe is kind of conspiring against me. I've always had fears of intimacy because my parents are very \"wait until marriage\" centered, so I'm still a virgin, seeing as I live with them and I want to respect their rules. However, my boyfriend (22) and I have been taking very small steps to get away from that mindset, and I've finally managed to see sex and intimacy as something that isn't \"wrong\" or \"sinful\". My boyfriend and I have been together for six years and we are very serious about the idea of marriage when I graduate, so we thought that we were ready to take our relationship to the next level.\n\nOn December 4th, 2016 I felt comfortable enough to engage in oral sex (me to him). I enjoyed it, which I didn't expect, but I'm terrified that I somehow got pregnant from it. It's very irrational, I know, but I can't get the thought out of my head.\n\nI know it's incredibly unlikely that I am pregnant. I didn't allow him to touch me, not even with his hands and especially not with his mouth (I'm still much too shy and guarded when it comes to receiving pleasure instead of giving it). I'm scared that when I went to the restroom about 40 minutes afterward that I accidentally got semen from my hands or mouth inside me and impregnanted myself. When I went to the bathroom I discovered that I had started my period as well, so I thought maybe while I was wiping/ putting on the panty liner some managed to wiggle it's way in me. At the time I wasn't on birth control (parents refused to even talk about it), but I have since started it on January 31st. \n\nI thought my fears would go away once my next period rolled around, but it only brought more fear. Leading up to my period, I began experiencing \"symptoms\" of pregnancy. My lower back hurt a lot, I had headaches (something I had never had before this), but the worse thing was this pressure in my bladder/uterus area as well as this feeling of a \"bubble\" pressing down on my left ovary. The pressure in my bladder/uterus began on December 23, and continued until I couldn't stand it anymore and went to a hospital on December 28th. At the hospital I was so scared that they were going to tell me I was pregnant. They gave me a urine test, which came out as negative, and I also got a CT scan to see if I was having any internal damage. The CT scan found that I had a cyst the size of a large raisin that burst on my right ovary recently. Lab tests showed that I had a kidney infection/UTI, which explained the pain in my back and bladder. I was given a prescription for Macrobid and sent home.\n\nI was okay until January 2nd rolled around and I didn't get my period. This terrified me. Before this, I have only had one late period my entire life. My \"period\" shows up on January 6th (4 days late), but it's unlike any I've ever had before. It's mostly brown blood and it's so light I almost don't notice it. I typically have moderate to heavy periods, so this was a huge flag to me. As the day wore on the bleeding turned more red and I began seeing some of the \"chunks\" I'm used to, but I'm still not bleeding as much as usual. However, I'm mostly convinced my period has come and I'm safe. When I go to change my liner, however, I notice this chunk of flesh thing. It scares me because I assume I'm having a miscarriage or something. As the day wears on I get more and more of these fleshy things, some short and flat, others long and stringy. I break down and start crying because this has never happened to me before. I call my mother into the bathroom to show her and she laughs at me and tells me what I'm experiencing is normal, especially after a ruptured cyst. My mother was a nurse for 12 years, so I do believe her, but I'm not entirely convinced. My \"period\" continues very lightly until the 8th (unusual for me, because I typically menstruate for 4 days), stops on the 9th, and begins around noon on the 10th with very dark, small spotting that lasts about six hours. \n\nAlmost as soon as my period ends, my UTI flares up again. I go to the doctor and get a prescription for Cipro, and it clears out the bacteria and I'm okay again. Two days later I begin feeling the signs of another, I go back to the doctor, but this time my test comes up negative. He says he will send my urine off to be cultured to see if there is anything unusual in it. At this point I have a mental breakdown. This pressure won't go away in my bladder, but now I'm convinced it's my uterus. The \"bubble\" on my left ovary is still present. I can't sleep, I cry constantly, I can't focus on college or even my hobbies, all I do is stay on the couch and torture myself with fears of being pregnant. My fears cause me to see symptoms in everything. My back pain is omnipresent, along with my bladder/uterus and ovary pain. I'm dizzy, I have headaches, and my breasts are sore. I begin obsessively checking my breasts for signs of darkening or growing nipples, as well as if they're growing or feel sore. I don't notice any physical changes as far as size/color/vein popping goes, but the breast pain is definitely there. I begin \"tracking\" my ovulation based on my discharge, but since I've never done it before I find it very hard to trust myself. \n\nDue to the ruptured cyst, my mother makes an appointment with the Gyno. At 21 I had never been before, but I was scared and I just needed reassurance. I was so sure that he'd find why this \"bubble\" on my left ovary never went away, and I could get medicine and be okay. He does the exam and tells me that my ovaries and breasts are completely normal, and he sends off my samples for a Papsmear. He asks me to meet him in his office and I'm so relieved, because I can finally get answers to my questions. \n\nWhen I get to the office my mother is there. Instead of letting me talk to the Gyno, she does most of the talking and makes me feel like a little kid. The Gyno prescribes Apri birth control for me, with instructions to begin it on the first day of my next period. He tries to leave, but I buck up the courage to ask to speak to him privately. My mother leaves the room and I ask him if the situation with my boyfriend could have led to pregnancy. He basically tells me that it's silly to think anything like that could lead to a baby, and that my fear/symptoms are all in my head. I'm not convinced but there's nothing else he can do for me. He sends me home, and I begin taking pregnancy tests.\n\nMy boyfriend has bought me so many pregnancy tests, I bet he's lost at least $30. I took the tests on the following dates: December 28th, January 8th, January 15th, January 21st, January 28th, February 3rd, and February 5th. Since then he has bought me three more tests that I have yet to take. All the above tests came out negative, and they were a mixture of First Response, Clearblue, and Clearblue Digital, as well as those simple \"dip\" tests that doctors/hospitals do. Each time I see \"negative\" I feel much better, but in a day or two my \"pregnancy symptoms\" return and I begin worrying again. I've lost six pounds from stress, because I simply don't have an appetite anymore. Once I took a bite from a fried egg and it tasted like rat poison. Since then I have forced myself to eat fried eggs, just to be sure that I'm not missing any \"symptoms\". No food has bothered me since then.\n\nHowever, when I got my \"period\" again, it was even worse than the last one. It started January 31st, which is almost a whole week early, and it was brown as well as light. I had very, very few \"chunks\" and those I did have were small. I again had the \"flesh\" (which I've since Googled and learned were chunks of my uterine lining that didn't dissolve), and I bled for only 2 1/2 days. I began my birth control and I have been taking it every night at exactly 9:00, and so far I don't seem to be having any side effects.\n\nHowever, for almost three months I've been plagued by this feeling of a \"bubble\" on my left ovary. Some days it's so bad I can't wear a belt, and I spend all the time I can in my pajamas. The pressure on my bladder/uterus is always there, and I'm terrified that that means that I'm pregnant. Sometimes it feels like my bladder/ uterus is a piece of taffy that is being stretched until it snaps back into place. I've never experienced this sensation before I was intimate with my boyfriend, and when I went to my Urologist she couldn't explain it, and she has me booked for further testing on March 1st. I'm at a loss as to what to do.\n\n2X, I've never been so scared in my life. I know it's incredibly unlikely that I am pregnant, but I feel like all the signs are there that I am. I've gotten so many negative pregnancy tests and I continue to get them, but it doesn't comfort me when it constantly feels like a baby is laying on my bladder while squeezing my ovary in its fist. If I was pregnant I'd be 9 weeks. Are these symptoms of a nine week pregnancy? Am I overthinking this? \n\nAll this has done is contributed to my fear of intimacy. My boyfriend is scared to touch me because of how I've reacted to all this, and I'm afraid I'll never be \"ready\" for actual sex after this. I want so badly to tell my parents about my worries, so that I can see a Gyno and get a bloodtest or ultrasound and know for sure, but if they knew that I was being intimate with my boyfriend, they would never allow me to see him again, and I'd be the family mockery. Sex is worse than drugs to them, it seems. I'm terrified of disappointing them, but I'm even more scared of being pregnant. I don't know what to do anymore\n\nCan any one give me advice or alleviate my fears? Any tips on how to tell my parents? Or am I worried about nothing at all? Has anyone experienced any ovary/uterus/bladder pain that's similar? I'm lost and I have no one with sexual experience to turn to.",

This is based on a single randomized study ([Jacobs IG, Finn JC, Jelinek GA, Oxer HF, Thompson PL. *Effect of adrenaline on survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.* Resuscitation. 2011 Sep;82(9):1138-43. ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=21745533) which is best summarized by their own conclusion\n\n> Patients receiving adrenaline during cardiac arrest had no statistically significant improvement in the primary outcome of survival to hospital discharge although there was a significantly improved likelihood of achieving ROSC.\n\nROSC isn't the end result of CPR, survivability is. The same conclusion is shown in other retrospective studies as well, e.g. [Hagihara A, Hasegawa M, Abe T, Nagata T, Wakata Y, Miyazaki S. *Prehospital epinephrine use and survival among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2012 Mar 21;307(11):1161-8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=22436956) which concludes that while more patient in the epinephrine/adrenaline group achieved ROSC they were equally likely (actually slightly less likely) to be discharged.\n\nAnother study found that among patients who are at a hospital when they fall into cardiac arrest early ephinehrine/adrenaline push (as within 2 min of the first defibrillation which is against the guidelines that says after defibrillation nr 2) is associated with a worse outcome, per [Andersen LW, Kurth T, Chase M, Berg KM, Cocchi MN, Callaway C, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines-Resuscitation Investigators. *Early administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) in patients with cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm in hospital: propensity score matched analysis.* BMJ. 2016 Apr 6;353:i1577.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27053638)  \nIt is a short article, well worth a read (and it is open access), but here is an excerpt\n> In conclusion, we found that early administration of epinephrine after the first defibrillation (that is, contrary to guidelines) was common (>50%) in patients who experience cardiac arrest in hospital with a shockable rhythm. Moreover, the provision of epinephrine at this time point was associated with a decreased chance of good outcome, including decreased in hospital survival.\n\n**The AHA guidelines**\n\nThe ACLS guidelines are heavily based on the [AHA guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20956224/).  They say\n> It is **reasonable to consider** administering a 1 mg dose of IV/IO epinephrine every 3 to 5 minutes during adult cardiac arrest.\n\nReasonable to consider is the wording used. Think about that for a minute. \n\nI would also like to add that high doses of epinephrine/adrenaline is associated with a worse outcome. If that is because the patient is in cardiac arrest for longer, or because the people doing it are less experienced and doesn't follow protocol is hard for me to say. \n\n**Amiodarone**\n\nThere are 2 studies (ALIVE and ARREST). Neither was powered to really detect what we are interested in (survivability). \n\nThe first of these two, [Dorian P, Cass D, Schwartz B, Cooper R, Gelaznikas R, Barr A. *Amiodarone as compared with lidocaine for shock-resistant ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 2002 Mar 21;346(12):884-90.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11907287) found that more patients who got amiodarone was admitted to the hospital, but failed to show (due to how it was constructed) that they were discharged more often. The second trial ([Kudenchuk PJ, Cobb LA, Copass MK, Cummins RO, Doherty AM, Fahrenbruch CE, Hallstrom AP, Murray WA, Olsufka M, Walsh T. *Amiodarone for resuscitation after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.* N Engl J Med. 1999 Sep 16;341(12):871-8.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10486418) showed the same, but didn't focus on survival to hospital discharge.\n\nTherefor the evidence is lacking. And again from the AHA  \n> Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO.\n\n**Edit 1.** /u/transmogrification pointed me towards another study, more recent then the above, [Kudenchuk PJ et al. *Amiodarone, Lidocaine, or Placebo in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest*. N Engl J Med. 2016 May 5;374(18):1711-22.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=27043165). This study concludes that\n\n> neither amiodarone nor lidocaine resulted in a significantly higher rate of survival or favorable neurologic outcome than the rate with placebo among patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.\n\nbut also\n\n> Finally, the point estimates of the survival rates in the placebo group and the amiodarone group differed less than anticipated when the trial was designed, which suggests that the trial may have been underpowered.\n\nSo there still may be a difference, but you would need 9000 study participants to find it with a 90% certainty. If it did have an effect of ca 3% that would be 1800 lives per year it could save, but the data as is doesn't support an effect larger than 3%.\n\n**Fibrinolysis**\n\nA lot of cardiac arrests are due to PE or AMI, and it would there go to reason that treating the clots would have an effect on survival. The problem is that when you give tPA you don't actually know why the patient went into cardiac arrest, and there hasn't been shown any benefit (a bit better effect on survival to ICU admission has been found), see [Böttiger BW, Arntz HR, Chamberlain DA, Bluhmki E, Belmans A, Danays T, Carli PA, Adgey JA, Bode C, Wenzel V; TROICA Trial Investigators; European Resuscitation Council Study Group. *Thrombolysis during resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.* N Engl J Med. 2008 Dec 18;359(25):2651-62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=19092151) and [Böttiger BW, Bode C, Kern S, Gries A, Gust R, Glätzer R, Bauer H, Motsch J, Martin E. *Efficacy and safety of thrombolytic therapy after initially unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a prospective clinical trial.* Lancet. 2001 May 19;357(9268):1583-5.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=11377646).\n\nIf we could select the right patients that may change, and with an increased amount of ultrasound used by ICU docs and even used during CPR we may be at a point where it is worth redoing such a study at a hospital (my own point of view).\n\n**Edit 2** As pointed out by the PEAPETT study [Sharifi M, Berger J, Beeston P, Bay C, Vajo Z, Javadpoor S; “PEAPETT” investigators. *Pulseless electrical activity in pulmonary embolism treated with thrombolysis (from the \"PEAPETT\" study).* Am J Emerg Med. 2016 Oct;34(10):1963-1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27422214) and /u/macreadyrj there have been newer studies then the ones cited above. However PEAPETT included 23 patients where 16 had a previous diagnosis of PE by CT pulmonary angiography, which isn't the case for a random cardiac arrest and 3 were diagnosed with PE by ultrasound criteria. I would thus interpret the study more as a safety study than anything else, since it also didn't show any significant bleedings. \n\n**Sodium bicarb**\n\nThe AHA states\n> There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance.\n\nAnd the study this is based at least partly on [Vukmir RB, Katz L; Sodium Bicarbonate Study Group. *Sodium bicarbonate improves outcome in prolonged prehospital cardiac arrest*. Am J Emerg Med. 2006 Mar;24(2):156-61.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=16490643) which despite the name states\n> **The empirical early administration of sodium bicarbonate (1 mEq/kg) has no effect on the overall outcome in prehospital cardiac arrest.** However, a trend toward improvement in prolonged (>15 minutes) arrest outcome was noted.\n\nIt should be said that there are specific circumstances were bicarb has it's use, but routinely using it simply hasn't been shown effective as stated by the AHA\n> In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial\n\n**Edit 3. Endotracheal Intubation** \n\nPer the AHA\n> However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.\n\nThere aren't any high quality studies and only a few retrospective studies, one of them saying that early intubation has a trend toward better survival at 24hrs; [Wong ML, Carey S, Mader TJ, Wang HE; American Heart Association National Registry of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Investigators. *Time to invasive airway placement and resuscitation outcomes after inhospital cardiopulmonary arrest*. Resuscitation. 2010 Feb;81(2):182-6.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20022157) and one study of poorly trained EMS on intubation of children failed to find an effect (and remember we think that ventilation is more important in children than in adults) [Gausche M, Lewis RJ. *Out-of-hospital endotracheal intubation of children*. JAMA. 2000 Jun 7;283(21):2790-2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10838643).\n\nA more recent study in Japan [Hasegawa K, Hiraide A, Chang Y, Brown DF. *Association of prehospital advanced airway management with neurologic outcome and survival in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. JAMA. 2013 Jan 16;309(3):257-66](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23321764) found that\n> Among adult patients with OHCA [out of hospital cardiac arrest], any type of advanced airway management was independently associated with decreased odds of neurologically favorable survival compared with conventional bag-valve-mask ventilation.\n\nYou also have another study, [Kajino K, Iwami T, Kitamura T, Daya M, Ong ME, Nishiuchi T, Hayashi Y, Sakai T, Shimazu T, Hiraide A, Kishi M, Yamayoshi S. *Comparison of supraglottic airway versus endotracheal intubation for the pre-hospital treatment of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest*. Crit Care. 2011;15(5):R236.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985431) which found two things. A supraglottic airway is equally effective to endotracheal intubation, but having a person certified to do endotracheal intubation was associated with a better outcome regardless of wether they did or didn't. Early placement of an advanced airway was associated with a better outcome.\n\n**Edit 4**\nThanks to dr /u/CytokineShitStorm for pointing me to this study, [Andersen LW, Granfeldt A, Callaway CW, Bradley SM, Soar J, Nolan JP, Kurth T, Donnino MW; American Heart Association’s Get With The Guidelines–Resuscitation Investigators. *Association Between Tracheal Intubation During Adult In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and Survival*. JAMA. 2017 Feb 7;317(5):494-506.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28118660) which is a 2017 observational study on cardiac arrest in the hospital setting which found\n>Although differences existed in prespecified subgroup analyses, intubation was not associated with improved outcomes in any subgroup. [...] Among adult patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest, initiation of tracheal intubation within any given minute during the first 15 minutes of resuscitation, compared with no intubation during that minute, was associated with decreased survival to hospital discharge.\n\nand thus it doesn't support intubating patients even at a hospital setting. As the guidelines stand intubation may still be the way to go, and by intubating the patient you may free up valuable resources. I always have an ICU/OR/anesthesia nurse present who can maintain any advanced airway or ventilate the patient if necessary so for me it wouldn't tie up any more hands to not intubate the patient. \n\n**Summary**\nHigh quality CPR and defibrillate as soon as possible. The rest is mostly guesses.",

    "text": "Terrible performance in school and only took QA internships. All hope of a software developer position was lost.. until today as I just accepted a software developer job! (A retrospective view of my job hunt) I thought that I was stuck in QA for the rest of my life.  A software development gig in the USA (I'm Canadian) was my end goal, but with terrible performance in school and internships in QA, I thought that was out of reach.\n\n**Before interviewing (my credentials)**\n\nI took my first internship in QA because it seemed like a cool place to start.  And it was.  I really enjoyed it.  It was a blast finding bugs and speeding through every single manual test case faster than my other coworkers in QA.  I learned so much about QA that I didn't realize existed before.  I made it my goal to learn as much as I can, since internships are a great opportunity to learn too.  My boss was a great mentor; he taught me everything there was to know about QA.  Near the end of my internship (it was 8 months) my boss took a few days off and allowed me to lead the team with another member of QA.  Though I thoroughly enjoyed it, programming was always my end goal, so probably 5% of my time (and some lunch hours) was spent working on scripts that would automate things.  Sometimes I would show my QA coworkers the scripts, sometimes they'd glance at me and ask it.  They weren't a lot of scripts, but they were enough to pad my resume with.\n\nMy next internship was in QA because I couldn't find a position in software development (I feel like my grades and cover letter were the reason why, with more emphasis on grades).  All of the software developer jobs that I applied for didn't respond, while 10%-20% of the QA jobs that I applied for did, so I took them with the intention of doing things similar to my first internship (ie. write scripts in my own time while at work).  At this company my boss liked my performance which lead to an extension of my internship.  My boss got a QA intern for another 4 months, while I got a few extra bullet points to put down on my resume.\n\nI failed my first CS class, which shows up on the first page of reading my transcript.  Imagine reading someone's transcript and seeing an F on the first page.  Not a good start, eh?  I also ended up failing data structures and algorithms. But hey, that's okay, a lot of people fail, so I put on my big boy pants and attempt it again.  This time is different though; I get a tutor and go to every single office hour.  Yet even with tutors and getting extra help the final was too much for me to handle, so I end up failing it once more.  That's *not* okay, how the hell does someone bounce back from this?  Turns out, there's a way.  My school requires you have a streak of great semesters before you can take a class for a third time.  So I ponied up and fucking had three semesters of great performance (not enough to bring my GPA above 3.0, but enough to retake the class again).  I retook the class and somehow passed it.  How I did so much better this time... I have no clue.  Every single examination was so much easier (except for my final, which I fucked up on, but the rest of my grades were enough to save me from another dreaded F).  I also had to retake Calculus 1 because I didn't meet the prerequisites for Calculus 2.\n\n**Getting that interview**\n\nSo how does someone that graduates with a bad GPA (2.7), failed Data Structures and Algorithms twice, retook four classes, and only took QA internships get interviews for software developer positions?  Honestly, the only relevant thing in that list of fuck ups is that I only took QA internships.  Not a single company asked for my GPA, and only one of 250 companies asked for my transcript.  So how *does* someone that only took internships in QA get an interview for a software developer position?  By marketing themselves as a developer.\n\nI wasn't a software developer nor did I have any work experience in roles that didn't have the letters \"QA\", so a lot of people that reviewed my resume often tossed it after reading those two letters.  90% of the work that I did at both places was QA work (manual testing).  However, that 10% is what I capitalized on in my resume.  I made sure that I never mentioned anything about manual testing, designing test cases, or anything else that I learned from my first internship in QA.  I did know that testing knowledge is very important, though, so I touched up on it in my cover letters.  I didn't shy away from my job title being \"QA Tester\", since that's the role that I was given.  With that said, my resume gave off the impression that I was a tool developer from the scripts that I created.  I was able to say that I worked on x, or developed y, or extended the functionality of z even though I only spent 3 hours on it.  I was also able to put that my internship was extended, which is a great thing to put on a resume when the things above it are development oriented.  Lastly, I was able to talk about the specific bullet points without hesitations or \"umm\"s.  If it was on my resume, you know damn well that I'd be able to talk about it for 10 minutes.\n\nI also had a lot of help from my personal projects.  These are VERY important.  Don't just make CRUD apps that you can whip up in a few hours.  I took concepts from my upper division CS classes and applied them to my own questions to find interesting answers.  One of these projects took one month, while another took four months.  I also had an iOS app that took 9 months.  These say a lot about your programming work ethic.\n\n**My actual job application process and interviewing**\n\nThough I graduated in June, I started applying in January 2017.  A lot of people here suggest applying in the Fall so that you'd have full time positions lined up by graduation, but a lot of the places that I applied to in January said that they \"can't see that far into the future\" for May positions.  They also said that \"they're looking for people to join the team in the next few weeks, not months\".  But that's okay.\n\nAt the beginning of my job hunt, my cover letter began as a full page of text with one paragraph brown-nosing the company, three paragraphs explaining how well I'd perform three bullet points from on the ad, and a final paragraph rewording the first paragraph.  It was very formal, with the name of the hiring manager (if their name is gender ambiguous I'd waste a lot of time doing my research on the company website or Linkedin trying to find out if they're male or female so that their salutation is correct; or address it to Hiring Manager), address, country, zip/postal code.  At the end of my job search (and the cover letter that got me a job) my cover letter was usually half a page.  The first paragraph was one sentence that said that I saw their ad on Indeed/company's career site/Friend's Facebook post.  The next paragraph was a paragraph that linked as much of their required skills and job duties to my own experiences in software development (basically saying how I'm a 80% match to what they're looking for).  I also added that I have a brain for testing, if it was an SDET role.  Sometimes I'd separate this into two paragraphs, cause no one likes reading big-ass paragraphs.  The last paragraph was a closing statement about me getting my degree, and how excited I am to work for that company.  If the company was american, I'd include ~~my favorite beer, why, and a link to the political party that I fully support~~ that I'm eligible for TN status to work at said company.\n\nOf around 250 applications, I had 26 companies actually move forward to a phone interview or online assessment.  My favorite interview experiences are the ones that started off with an HR phone screen.  It felt like they actually cared about the people that they were interviewing.  I applied to several positions at every company, and while I wrote a cover letter for every single one, it was difficult for me to know exactly which position I was being interviewed for.  One thing that I really appreciated was when the recruiter would tell me exactly the position that I was being interviewed for, rather than guessing what position it's for.  If they didn't tell me, I'd ask, but sometimes the responses and answers are more vague than the job duties in the position description.  This is painful when the first interview is a technical interview and you don't know if you need to brush up on your linux admin tools cause one of the jobs that you applied to was part of the infrastructure team.  This happened and it was so annoying.  My worst technical phone interview experience was one where the guy asked me a question that was totally irrelevant to the things that he suggested online in preparation for technical interviews.  In this experience I was given the name of my interviewer, and the HR person suggested that I visit his LinkedIn and tech blog.  On his tech blog he had suggestions on how to prepare for interviews, but the interview that I had with him was totally fuckin different than what he suggested on his blog post.  The phone call also cut off in the middle of the conversation (never ever happened with my other phone interviews which are all done in my room)!\n\nOf those 26 companies, I had on-campus interviews with 5 different companies.  Three of them were in Canada (local), and two of them were in the USA (they paid for flight, hotel, expenses, and one of them paid for the rental car).  I had no experience with LeetCode when I started.  Looking back at how I approached my interview questions, holy shit did I need LeetCode.  I never thought it would make me a better developer, but it did.  It changed the way that I thought about my problems.  I never broke down problems into potential data structures that I could use, and instead, just hacked something together.  But then again, interviews just want to see that someone knows how to program, right?! (no)  Though exhausting, my favorite on-campus interviews were the ones where you were there for the entire day.  I appreciated this because you didn't need to go back to the company for a second time.  It also helped with nerves to get past the first interviewer.  In the first interview, my brain is foggy as hell and I'm not as sharp when it comes to coming up with an optimal solution.  But once that first interview is done my brain is wired and ready to go.  It also helps me understand the culture of the workplace when I'm there for 6-8 hours, rather than there for just one.\n\nOf those 5 different companies, I had a verbal offer from two of them (both in the USA) and got a written offer from one of them.  I got Company A's verbal offer on a Thursday morning, and got Company B's verbal offer on the afternoon of the Friday following it.  Company A offered more than Company B and offered a signing bonus that Company B did not offer, so I told Company B my offer from Company A, and she told me that she'd try to get the guys upstairs to match it, but there's no guarantees.  At 5:40 PM (on that Friday) I receive an email from Company A that they won't be continuing with me.  On Monday (That weekend felt like months tbh, couldn't sleep, questioned whether I should've just taken the offer and tell HR that the verbal offer with the other company fell through) she called me and told me that there's no jump in salary but she could give me a signing bonus which was higher than Company A's signing bonus (which was effectively 0, and so was their salary), to which I accepted.\n\n**Too long, did not read**\n\n* I had two 8 month internships in QA but wanted to get a software developer job\n\n* At both QA gigs I would devote 5-10% of my time (Lunch hours, time that wasn't spent on Reddit) to working on scripts\n\n* Marketed myself as a developer on my resume.  Some interviewers even said that they would consider my previous roles as a tool developer, not a QA tester\n\n* My cover letter started off as a full page of filler for two to three points related to the job, but eventually was trimmed down to half a page of good content that was really really related to the job\n\n* Sent 250 applications, 26 moved forward with phone interviews or online assessments\n\n* Only one company asked for my transcript\n\n* From 26 phone interviews/online assessments came 5 companies that wanted to see my human form\n\n* From 5 companies that saw me in person, I got two verbal offers (both USA) and one written offer (accepted after an excruciating weekend)\n\n* Verbal offers can fall through\n\n**Last minute comments**\n\n* If I could do it again, I wouldn't.  I hate interviews and hate applying for jobs even more.\n\n* Rejections hurt in the beginning, but eventually you become numb to them\n\n* The mental toll that I had waiting for Company B to come back to me was worse than waiting for marks to come back from an exam that you're not sure if you passed or not.  If you're not a top tier developer like myself and you're desperate for a job, I recommend taking it.  The signing bonus that I got is great but mental health is greater.\n\n* Start using sites like Leetcode and Geeksforgeeks.  I really like the Leetcode random button.\n\n* For the most part, Glassdoor interviews were unreliable\n\n* To be honest this subreddit didn't help at all\n\n* What helped more than anything is looking my interviewers up on Linkedin so that I can ask questions that are more tailored to them.  \n\n* At one company I asked HR what work-life balance was like, and she said that it's great, that the company values having your own healthy life outside of the company.  At the same company, I asked about worklife balance to a senior developer that's been there for 3 years, and he said that typically developers show up at 10 am and leaves at 7:30 pm.  Noped out of that.\n\nThanks for reading, everyone.\n\nEdit: Made things easier to read.",

    "text": "Employment for terrible programmers? I'm a horrible programmer pursuing a computer science degree at a (supposedly) good school in Canada (UBC) with a high GPA; I also have a Math degree from a (supposedly) better school (Waterloo). I enjoyed finding out that Math degrees at a bachelor's level don't have the greatest prospects, so I decided to adult up and get an actual professional career. However, not much seems to have changed. I have little practical experience (8 month internship with the statistical agency of the government in Canada) and am incredibly awful at programming interviews. Two of the interviews I had were fairly simple, but I failed because I didn't even know about string immutability. I also have very little in the way of projects. I'm not particularly smart, and mostly rely on hard work. I've never struggled with the stuff I've worked with in school or work apart from the algorithmic trivia questions which seem to give me fits...\n\nThe only projects I've done involved a few simple GUI based applications in Java using Spring (tic-tac-toe game and a basic calculator) and some web stuff like HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, etc (nothing in demand like AngularJS, NodeJS, ASP.net etc). I also have a few school projects, but I only worked on sections of those for assignments (some code was provided to us). I, somehow managed to get an internship with the government as the questions asked were primarily knowledge-based questions after failing the aforementioned interviews.\n\nI have accepted that I will not be able to get into one of the highly sought after tech giants, and it's not something I lose sleep over. Despite my best efforts by working through books on programming and frequenting websites like leetcode, i just don't feel cut out of for these types of interviews. However, reading job ads online on indeed just makes me sad. Many positions require at least 2 years of experience for new developers and reading reviews regarding some of these companies on glassdoor is even more disheartening. I understand that reviews on these websites tend to attract people who have had bad experiences, but seeing a lot of these does seem to imply more than a few disgruntled past employees.\n\nBased on that, it seems to me that, unless you get in with one of these sought after companies (i.e. Google, MSFT, FB, etc), you're just wasting your time. I don't expect to make over $70k starting out. I just want a stable job, with reasonable working hours with understandable overtime when needed, that pays the bills and allows me to focus on my true passion; learning. I'm not really interested in pursuing further education of an academic nature like a PhD given the politics involved and the difficulty associated with getting a tenured position.\n\nCurrently, I'm in my final year, but with only 1 internship under my belt. I'm planning to get another one and am still hopeful, unsure why, that with past experience, a good GPA, and a few senior level courses, I can snag a position that doesn't require me to be an algorithmic wiz. However, on the other I feel I'm just running away from the realization that I'm just doing this to run away (I had to throw a recursive joke because I had to throw a recursive joke) from the inevitable grind of finding a full-time job and the feeling that the longer you're unemployed, the more difficult it is to actually find a job, so even if I can't find anything, recruiters can't screw me over for being unemployed. Sorry for that run-on sentence...\n\nThe government's full-time hiring processes are hit or miss to say the least, and do involve some degree of brown nosing from what I have gathered hearing people talk at work. Getting an internship with them is much easier, and I'm not the most sociable guy in the world, so that's also a strike against me. Apart from my supervisor who seems impressed by more hard work, I made no connections with anyone in the workplace and the best he can offer is a reference, which although nice to have, does little to promise future employment.\n\nIf anyone actually, read this far...should I even stay in this field or get the hell out? I don't even know what else I could do at this point...",

    "text": "Words of advice from a former 4th year associate at PwC I had an interesting time at this firm.  I was a third year with a 3 rating all three years but wasn't promoted.  My understanding was that if you're not on promotion track you'd have known about it before your 3rd year CRT results, but my snapshots my 3rd year were all on point (about 60% at next level, 40% partially at next level with multiple high level performance differentiators from managers and no performance improvement points).  In my fall and spring career meeting I was told I was on track... I even had discussions with multiple managers stating they were actively pushing for me to be promoted.\n\nSo what happened?  I guess one manager in my 3rd year didn't like me personally.  \n\nThe official firm reason for not promoting was, although my knowledge and ability were there, that they felt that there was one alternative procedure that I should have done one day sooner on one job than I did... This is not an exaggeration or a joke.  The kicker is that this task was actually in a 2nd years queue, I only took it on to help the team because I worked more efficiently, had completed my more difficult workload and was able to pick the task up from him to get it done... The procedure was done 6 days sooner than the prior year and we signed off 5 days sooner than the prior year so it clearly had no bearing on the audit... Yet that 2nd year was early promoted and this task was what was used to not promote me.  He had a better relationship with that manager and was able to better connect because they had more in common personally (religious beliefs).\n\nThe other concern was that I didn't volunteer for something irrelevant (which the promoted 2nd year didn't volunteer for either...).  This the only quantitative feedback they gave regarding the decision.\n\nI went back and forth with my Relationship Leader, my other managers (outside the one day late manager) and HR but obviously it was moot.  In those discussions HR, the HR manager revealed to me the following:\n\nWhen I referred to the high level of my snapshots, I was told by HR that snapshots have no bearing on rating or promotion.\n\nWhen I referred to the fact that I was doing another associates work as a favor and it was held against me, I was told by HR that we aren't evaluated against our peers.\n\nWhen I brought up that other managers were willing to stand up for me for promotion, I was told by HR that it doesn't matter what the majority of my managers and senior managers say, one manager who says no overrules 2-3 who say yes.\n\nI found this astounding, so I quit on the spot.  My feeling was that they had ample time to tell me that they didn't think I was meeting expectation... In fact the 3 rating in my 3rd year kind of outlines that, if they thought I wasn't \"senior ready\" they should have rated me a 4, put me on a Performance Plan and not asked me to be \"acting senior\". Instead, in the same conversation, I was told I had a good year, had been given positive feedback but they felt that I was not ready to be a senior but that I was ready to continue as \"acting senior.\" The whole thing was very confusing.\n\nBased on this, I think all the incoming associates deserve to know the following: \n\nSnapshots are complete and utter bullshit (according to PwC HR).\n\nThe firms claims of \"real time feedback\" and \"flexibility\" are complete and utter bullshit (according to PwC HR)\n\nThe 'PwC Professional Framework' is complete and utter bullshit (according to PwC HR).\n\nI would imagine everything the firm publishes you should expect them to act literally the opposite when it comes down to things.\n\nLastly, my suggestion to incoming first years:\n\nBrown-nose, Brown-nose, Brown-nose... hell even suck some dick if you have to... Because you're never getting back that Thanksgiving Dinner with family that you are asked to skip... and you're never getting those meaningful personal relationships that you lose when working 80+ hours back.  But a quick BJ in the men's room stall might be the difference between you and your peer, who is not evaluated on the same factors you are and probably already beaten you to that blowie in the men's room anyway.\n\nBecause what you actually do here for 80+ hours a week doesn't mean shit, making that one miserable manager feel good about their sad decision to stay so long in such a shitty job is all that matters.\n\nOh, and my industry job pays 15% more than I would have made if I had been promoted, I'm home by 6:15 every day and I'm never asked to work holidays and rarely do I need to open my computer on the weekends.  The grass is actually much much greener.\n\nEdited for spelling.",

Prompt which inspired me:https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5tdx45/wp_a_take_on_office_politics_with_a_game_of/\n\n\n\nThere are two types of people in this world. The nice guys ,the type of guys who wouldn’t hurt a fly. They keep their head down and they work. They abhor conflict in all forms and they are terrified of being unfair. Then there is the second kind, the kind of person who achieves what he wants. Which do you think I am?\nI am a senior manager in one of the top 4 accounting firms on the planet. Which one?As if I’d tell you. This isn’t my first rodeo. This is purely a work of fiction and any resemblance of characters to people living or dead is purely coincidental.\nI walked into my clients office at 8. The audit room faced a beach, an empty beach. That is the carrot and I am the stick. The room smelled of sweat and associate tears. I approach Johnson.\nJohnson is a twat. Be that as it may he’s next in line for manager and with the economy being what it is ,suffice it to say this firm isn’t big enough for the both of us.I missed the birth of my first child  for this company.I’ll be damned if I get thrown off the partner track by an overachieving, brown nosing upstart.\n“Excuse me?” \nShit  I think I said that out loud.\n“Johnson! Just the man I wanted to see”\n“Hello sir. Hows the family?”\nMy wife is a bitch and my kid doesn’t network enough\n“Oh couldn’t be better!And how about you?Hows the wife?”\n“Oh Janines pregnant”\nShit.Hope that’s not mine.\n“That’s fantastic Johnson. So about this assignment. It’s going to be a good learning experience for you”\nThat’s code for ‘You’re going to have a bad time’.He knows it and I know it.\n“Also I have given you Harold and Brenda.Two of my best people no less”\nHarold was indeed the best at getting the team coffee and I suspect Brenda has a burgeoning glue addiction.\n“If you say so Chad”\nThe sucker bought it! What did I tell you? Massive twat.\n“Excuse me?”\nShit I really should stop talking to myself.\n“Oh just talking to myself.You know how it is”\nJohnson gave me a symphathetic nod and went back to his laptop. With a severely underequipped team at his disposal,an inviting beach and a non-cooperative client, his rating will plummet. I have just enough pull with the partners to deny him his promotion if that happens.\nSo I banged his wife and stabbed him in the back.Some would pat themselves on the back and call it a day.But not I,I decided to put one final nail in the coffin;I was going to steal his sandwich.\n“Chad your wallet”\n“Huh?”\n“You’ve left you wallet”\n“Oh,thanks man” \nI went to the pantry and grabbed the lunch box which had “PROPERTY OF MR JOHNSON” emblazoned on it.I grabbed a huge bite of the sandwich and swallowed it whole.Victory tasted like…peanuts?Shit.Shit.Shit! I felt my throat closing up.I fumbled for my wallet.Opened it.Cant breathe. Hit the epipen its not there.Why the fuck isn’t it there.Then it hit me. Johnson had my wallet. Johnson knew I was fucking him over. Killing me would mean the manager position opens up and he’ll get the job irrespective of how shitty a job he does over here. Shit.\nI crumbled to the floor and then saw black.\n*****************************************************************************\n“Thank you Mr Chad.Your story confirms what we already knew” the balding detective assured me.\n“The Epipen was found in his bag hours after you were taken into the hospital” he ruffled through his rather shabby notes\n“And Glenda from your HR Department confirmed that Johnson had fleeting access to your HR Records”\n“So the bastards going to jail, isn’t he?”\n“For a long time Mr. Chad”\nThe detective and his partner left.It was just me,my laptop and the ECG now.\nI ignored the call from Glenda. I owe her and she will be rewarded….in time. I opened my laptop and got back to work.This is why I love this firm;its work life balance.\nOh, you want to know what happened? Wouldn’t you like to know? Going back to the two type of people that exist. The only thing I can tell you is I’m of the second variety.",

I only ask because if there are, how, exactly do you function in your job knowing what you read in this subreddit? Do you work to change any of it? Do these things being expressed by us seem ok to you somehow? Do you feel powerless to change it? Are all these men and women simply wrong about how the world works and what should be done to change it?\n\nI've been working for the past few years to finally do whatever it takes to overcome the abuse, addiction, trauma, depression and feelings of abandonment I've had to suffer these past 56 years. I tried and failed over and over again despite being as diligent and persistent as I could.\n\nI've risen and fallen so many times I can barely remember some of them. If you are one of the people I mentioned in the title, do you understand that there are tens and HUNDREDS of thousands of men like me? Do you feel you bear NO responsibility to us? Do you ever ponder what will begin to happen if you keep doing what you do?\n\nEvery day. Every. Single. Day. In spaces like this and others you read, see and hear about male imprisonment, alienation of fathers, butchering the genitals of male infants, VAWA, the Duluth Model and the attendant arrest policies and training for LEOs. The educational and academic crises boys and men are facing. Terrorizing men in the workplace, in social situations, hell, at the PARK ffs... I swear, I could go on forever with this list.\n\nAre you all afraid to address these things? Do you just not understand them and so feel you can't do anything about them? Are you all stupid, or just malicious and indifferent? Regardless of how you answer those questions, do you have any concern for what will happen if you DON'T address them? If your answer to THAT question is no, then I'll have to conclude that you are stupid... Because there are many, many more of us thrown away men EVERY DAY. We're giving up. We're killing ourselves (either quickly with guns, ropes and other forms of violence or slowly with drugs, alcohol or other self-destructive behaviors).\n\nThe hell of it is, society is telling us NOT to give up! I hate to be the one to bring this up, but what do you suppose will happen if we DO stop giving up and killing ourselves...? Do you honestly believe we will simply accept our lot in life and remain quietly on the garbage pile you've put us on? Again, that's just willful blindness and ignorance.\n\nAnd whom do you point us to in the social sphere...? Men like Jackson Katz, Michael Kimmel & Michael Messner? Women like Amanda Marcotte, Jessica Valenti and Clementine Ford? Jeezus, the most honest example of a woman even recognizing the humanity of ordinary men is Brene Brown.... She's a protege of Oprah Winfrey!! Sorry, but that's just not gonna cut it.\n\nDo you all in the public sector just not understand the forces you're playing with? Don't you get it?\n\nWhat the hell is going to happen when this all leaks out into the streets and you have open, violent unrest and conflict... Not between classes, or races or politics or religion, but among the genders? How the hell are you going to manage that? Really. I'd love to hear the contingency plan for open, violent conflict between men and women breaks out.\n\nLike I said, tens and hundreds of thousands of us now, and more every day. Just lately we either kill ourselves or just ghost to one degree or another.\n\nYou all do NOTHING about this other than more draconian laws, more anti-male policies for employers, educators and healthcare providers, the outright embarrassment that is social support for victimized men and boys and more and more aggressive, brutal and punitive law enforcement and courtroom policies aimed solely at MEN.\n\nHow long do suppose we're going to put up with this...?",

Everything checks out  par was changed at lunch and relatively clean, the mooncup could be drained... But I really don't want to go through that hassle... I'll do it after the meeting when there aren't other girls in the bathroom. I decided to roll up a bunch of toilet paper as backup and went on my merry way to my meeting. \nNearing the end of the meeting I started cramping. I decided I would go to the bathroom again as soon as the meeting was out. I need to talk less, I went over on my meeting and the next meeting a training presentation. It was about that time I really started gushing... I needed to go now... But I could not move. I was doing everything I could to try and hold in the feeling so I could stand up. I finally was able to excuse myself and I went to get a new overnight maxi. I started walking to the bathroom calmly at first. Then my hand brushed my butt, wetness, I started walking faster. Through the mantrap, across a hall in a sea of cubicles, in front of the break room finally to the bathroom. I was confident that my strategicly chosen black pants were shielding me. \n\nAgain warning it's gross.\n\nWhen I went to change I found soaked panties almost no dry cloth left, silent tears started falling. I need to get that damn surgery, no I needed to change my pad, see if my massive leak is visible, get my stuff and run like the wind home to change. I stopped crying and started cleaning. I was still excited that I was wearing black pants. When I left the stall  I walked past coworkers and tried to hurry and wash my face. I was fortunate no one talked to me. I turned around to see a redish brown, it was pretty much glowing... :'( I couldn't hold back the tears anymore. I just didn't know what to do at this point. I was fucked, there was no way I could leave this room. There was nothing I could do and it wasn't stopping. I called my coworker to bring my stuff to the bathroom. Luckily she brought another one of my friends to help. I just sobbed, I let them know what happened. It was then I realized I probably soiled the chair and that we needed to get it before someone sat in it. Then I realized that the presentation I left suddenly was being recorded... That is right... Fucking recorded. I put on my backpack lowered it to cover my butt walk with my coworker who followed behind me. I am grateful for having her to talk to and she walked me all the way to my car. I gave her a hug and thanked her for helping me. It was time for my work day to end.",

    "text": "Enrollments, budgets fall short at universities known for ‘social justice warfare’  more people are getting the message. not attending these indoctrination centres is more effective. less students less revenue.\n............................................\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/14/enrollment-drops-at-schools-known-for-social-justi/\n\nUniversities known for being hotbeds of campus protest and liberal activism are struggling with declining enrollments and budget shortfalls, and higher education analysts say that’s no coincidence.\nTake Oberlin College. According to a document leaked to The Oberlin Review, the school’s student newspaper, the small liberal arts college famous for social justice hoaxes has had trouble attracting and retaining students, missing this year’s enrollment mark by 80 and racking up a $5 million budget deficit in the process.\nWilliam A. Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School who runs the Legal Insurrection blog, said the “most obvious culprit” in Oberlin’s dwindling admissions is “relentless social justice warfare.”\n\n“Social justice warfare at Oberlin has been more intense and sustained over a longer period of time than at most schools, and has come to define Oberlin in the media,” Mr. Jacobson said. “The resulting mockery and derision, even in liberal publications, has damaged the Oberlin brand.”\nSurveys support the notion that, in the era of Trump, conservatives have become more skeptical about the value of a college degree.\nThe polarizing presidential election was felt in the dip in applicants at some top-tier colleges such as Ohio’s Kenyon College.\n\n“This is a year in which you were vulnerable if you were a small liberal arts college in a rural red state and you attract a significant portion of your student body from the East Coast or West Coast, which would certainly be the case with Kenyon,” Diane Anci, Kenyon’s vice president of enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, told the Ohio school’s Kenyon Collegian newspaper.\nA study published by the Washington-based Pew Research Center in July found that just 36 percent of Republicans believe colleges and universities have a positive effect on the country, down from 54 percent two years ago.\nGallup released a poll in August that found just 33 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents had a “great deal or quite a lot of confidence in higher education.” Sixty-seven percent said they have “some or very little” confidence in academia.\nHigh school counselors report that, in the past few years, parents have been more likely to express concern about sending their children to schools with progressive reputations.\n“Many won’t consider Oberlin or Wesleyan, and Brown is completely off the table,” one counselor told Inside Higher Education in June.\n\nThe problem may be especially pronounced among the nation’s heartland. Inside Higher Education reports that several prestigious, small liberal arts colleges in the Midwest have missed their enrollment marks this year.\nSome college administrators have taken notice. According to Inside Higher Education’s annual survey, 52 percent of admissions directors from public colleges and 28 percent from private ones said they were stepping up their recruitment of students from rural areas in the wake of the presidential race.\nDeclining enrollments have previously been observed at colleges and universities that became notorious for chaotic campus activism, including the University of Missouri and Evergreen State College.\nBy some estimates, enrollment at the former is down 35 percent since fall 2015, when student protests helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement.\nMeanwhile, Evergreen faces a $2.1 million budget shortfall this year since students took over the campus last spring, barricading themselves in the library, berating administrators on a regular basis and forcing one dissenting professor to teach off campus out of fear for his safety.\nA spokesperson for Oberlin College did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\nThe school’s problems cannot be traced to a single incident but to several.\nIn February 2013, mass hysteria ensued after racist and anti-Semitic flyers and graffiti began to appear all over campus. Classes were canceled, meetings were held and students began to see racism around every corner, including when someone reported seeing a member of the Ku Klux Klan on campus. It turned out to be a woman walking around wrapped in a blanket to keep warm.\nNot only that, the perpetrators behind the racist paraphernalia turned out to be two progressive students, one of whom was confirmed to be an Obama supporter, trying to get a reaction out of their classmates and the administration.\nRather than admit the whole thing was a hoax and move on, the Oberlin administration doubled down on a social justice agenda, including the implementation of a privilege and oppression “reorientation” for first-year students.\nIn the ensuing years, Oberlin students would go on to make frequent demands of the university, ranging from the end of culturally appropriated meals at the dining hall, such as General Tso’s chicken and sushi, to the elimination of grades below a C.\nIn 2015, after the University of Missouri protests, the Oberlin Black Student Union issued a 14-page letter making 50 demands of the administration. They included exclusive “safe spaces” for black students and the elimination of graduation requirements for classes in Western civilization.\nLast November, Oberlin students targeted Gibson’s Bakery, a beloved store in Oberlin, Ohio, after an employee called police when he saw someone attempting to shoplift by concealing two bottles of wine under his jacket. The accused shoplifter turned out to be a black Oberlin student.\nThe Black Student Union, Oberlin Student Senate and College Democrats spearheaded a boycott of the bakery and organized protests outside of the store. Even the Oberlin administration, responding to calls from Black Lives Matter supporters on campus, stopped purchasing goods from the bakery.\nThree students involved in the incident ended up pleading guilty to attempted theft and aggravated trespassing. As part of a plea deal, the students acknowledged that the bakery’s actions were “not racially motivated” and that the store was “merely trying to prevent an underage sale.”\nMost of the enrollment deficit at Oberlin came from a smaller-than-expected freshman class, which totaled 742 instead of a projected 805.\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that drop-off is more serious than it may appear.\n“That doesn’t sound like an astonishing number of people not coming, but weighed on a percentage basis, that’s a huge drop in just one year,” Mr. Wood said. “And Oberlin has for some time been struggling to make its classes. This wasn’t just some negligence: ‘Oh, we didn’t realize that we had to try harder to get students.’ They’ve been trying really hard to get students, and students just aren’t coming.”\nHe said Oberlin can easily recoup the $5 million deficit by cutting the “apparatus of political correctness” that has swelled in the past several years. When that happens, he said, it will be a sign that the school is serious about reform.\n“The signal that I would look for is when they begin to divest from the large number of personnel who are employed wholly because of their political orientations,” he said. “When that happens, I think we will have seen a college that has decided to reposition itself in the market. Until then, it’s all just show.”",

Apparently there was at least one other example:\n\n[The Mochica](https://www.yahoo.com/news/blogs/geekquinox/unearthed-peruvian-tomb-confirms-women-ruled-over-brutal-160013738.html?ref=gs)\n\n>This find makes it clear that women didn't just run rituals in this area but governed here and were queens of Mochica society,\" said project director Luis Jaime Castillo, according to the Associated Free Press.\n\n>\"It is the eighth priestess to be discovered,\" he added. \"Our excavations have only turned up tombs with women, never men.\"\n\nMen were apparently forced into ritual combat where the losing side was sacrificed.  \n\nThere was a fad in the 70s and 80's started by figures like Riane Einsler (\"The Chalice and the Blade\") suggesting that if women ran society we would live in peaceful utopias.   The ideology is discussed in [\"Sanctifying Misandry\"](http://www.mqup.ca/sanctifying-misandry-products-9780773538733.php) by Paul Nathanson and Katherine Young:\n\n\"To set the stage, the authors discuss two massively popular books - Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code and Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade - both of which rely on a feminist conspiracy theory of history. They then show how some goddess feminists and their academic supporters have turned what Christians know as the Fall of Man into the fall of men. In the beginning, according to three \"documentary\" films, our ancestors lived in an egalitarian paradise under the aegis of a benevolent great goddess. But men either rebelled or invaded, replacing the goddess with gods and establishing patriarchies that have oppressed women ever since. In the end, however, women will restore the goddess and therefore paradise as well. The book concludes with several case studies of modern goddess religion and its effects on mainstream religion.\"\n\nVariations of this theme can still be seen today in gender studies departments.  In Sweden they are even pushing for a \"feminist foreign policy\" that would stress diplomacy over war.   Apparently these ladies are unaware of the fact that [Queens initiated more wars than Kings](http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/01/european-queens-waged-more-wars-than-kings.html).  Or that men evolved [better making up skills](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36969103).  \n\nAnother feminist myth bites the dust.",

    "text": "Quitting your job. What's the best quit your job stories? I was there four long years, but I wish it would have been 4 hours. At first it wasn't that bad in my eyes because it was my first entry level job and I was making more money than I had my entire life. But after a few months and I was let loose so to speak, things got toxic as hell. First off, I had three bosses. All three were snarky, entilted,full of themselves, disrepsectful, perverted, vulgar, etc. I could go on and on. I started as a 22 year old male, and even I would literally cringe at the things they would say about women, politicians, other co-workers, or just anybody they felt deserved their ridicule. One manager in particular, who was my main boss, was the most repulsive. He made the other two look like angels dipped in pixie dust. He was short, fat, dipped snuff and typically had it all over his face, extremely loud, bullish, etc. Again, I could write a book on how awful this guy is/was. He would patronize the receptionist on a daily basis. And belittle anything and anybody. Any woman, and I mean any age or color, that walked in the door he couldn't help but judge her attractiveness in the most asinine way. Needless to say, I pretty much heard a grown tell me how he would fuck said woman every day of the week. He would plop his fat belly on top of his desk and imitate sex moves. It was disgusting and me and my co-workers had to sit through this and smile like we approved of what he was doing. It was awful. Not only did he do lewd acts like the mentioned, but he may have been the most judgemental/hypocritical human being I have ever been around. He would criticize people for not raising their kids right even though he didn't have any. He would make people feel like complete shit for taking their company issued vacations but he would miss four days in a row with no explaination. He mocked and made fun of an employee when he was going through a divorce, yet his wife had been wanting to leave him for months. He called another co worker worthless and a loser because he was struggling with an alcohol addiction, but he was a recovering alcoholic. He just flat out sucked to be around. Needless to say, he was a big part of the job being a toxic environment for everyone. But besides all that, they were extremely unfair with our work. We were in sales, and we had a damn good sales teams. We were breaking monthly and yearly sales records left and right. But none of that was good enough. We had weekly and in some cases daily meetings where we were threatened with our jobs if we didn't do this or do that. And anytime someone stood up for everybody, they would start their belittling train of garbage and try and make us feel 3 foot tall. We struggled to meet their impossible and unfair goals. At only 25, I had to check myself into the ER one night because of stress related palpitations. My BP was high and I was just burnt out. I tried my damnest to get out. I had a couple of interviews mixed in but nothing came about. I was ready to take a job shoveling poop just to get out of that God forsaken place. Well, one day...... shit hit the fan. I was working a customer and got him to commit, I went to my main bosses office to tell him what was going on. Well, he proceeded to tell me that he didn't like the way I handled the deal and I was awful at my job. (Keep in mind I have the deal SOLD) I slightly showed anger and told him I didn't appreciate him talking to me like that and that I've done nothing but work my ass off for him. He stands up and starts screaming in my face. Calls me a lazy piece of shit, a \"lazy millennial\", and that I should just go live off my dad's money (my dad is not rich). Welp, I shoved him. Shoved him as hard as I could against the wall and we go to tussling all over the place. Co workers break us up and as we are standing face to face I call him every name I've ever wanted to call him. It was the most relieving yet upsetting thing I have ever done. Of course, he says I'm fired. And I tell him great, I don't want to work for a fat, tea pot shaped fuck anyway (LOL). I go home that night and call everybody from the General Manager to the CEO and pour my soul into telling them what was going on at that store between me and everyone who works there. See, all they see is numbers, they had no idea what was going on inside. Well, the GM calls the next couple of days and is sucking up like crazy. Not only does he offer me to stay, he offers an extra week of vacation and he is willing to pay for it up front. They knew how pissed I was and I had ammo to turn their shit show into a PR nightmare. I accepted the offer and took the money and quit the day after. Best day of my life.",

    "text": "I was raped on Wednesday and I just needed to write about it a little Why am I so focused on insignificant things? Why am I so bothered that I have to leave my favorite pair of thrift store jeans on a piece of paper spread across the bathroom floor? They cost me less than ten dollars and they were starting to get loose around my hips anyway. Why do I care when the detective and her partner take my bedsheets away in a brown bag? I got them with a coupon at Bed, Bath, and Beyond and the thread count wasn't even that high. Why do I fear that my nurse will judge me when I mention to her I dyed my pubic hair purple a few weeks ago after she clips away several strands? Why do I worry that calling the strawberry Zofran tablet I dissolved under my tongue an antiemetic will make me seem too knowledgeable about a process I've never been through? Will they think I'm lying because I circled around the parking garage a couple times across from the police station instead of just parking in a handicap spot right out front? Will they tell me it's too gray to proceed with charges? I had told him ahead of time that I didn't want a relationship or sex. I told him that things were moving too fast and I was still in love with someone else and I wanted to be celibate for the next year. I told him all of this before we met and he agreed that we should just be friends. And still he came through my door and hugged me and later said on the phone that I gave him mixed signals because I sat down on my bed. I was wearing a t-shirt and jeans. I wasn't trying to send any signals. He started kissing me and I hadn't even looked at his face yet. So he kissed me and I kissed him back even though I didn't want to. And he slipped his hand under my shirt and grabbed my breast and asked me to take my shirt off and I did. And he gnawed on my left nipple piercing and I looked at him for the first time and felt disgusted. And my pants were off and I can't remember how they ended up down at my ankles. Did he do that? Did I? He's biting at my stomach and touching me and licking me and I don't want this. I keep turning away and he asks me why I won't look at him and why I'm hiding my face. I tell him I'm shy because I'm scared if I tell him I think he's repulsive he'll get mad and sometimes when men get mad they hit you. Sometimes when men get mad they kill you. So I just roll over and lift my comforter over my face like a child watching a horror movie. His pants are off and he's standing on my bed looking down at me and I feel small. I don't want to look at his body. He doesn't look like the person in the pictures he sent me. He doesn't even appear to be the nationality he claims to be. He wedges himself between my legs and tries to fuck me and I tell him no and I'm so proud of myself. And he's says \"ok\" and I'm relieved. I explain to him that earlier in the week that things got out of hand at a photoshoot and I slept with the other model and even though it was consensual it wasn't something I felt good about. And he seems like he understands and he says he's sorry about that and then he asks when I'd last been fucked prior to that. I keep turning away. He holds me, spoons me like we're some couple and not strangers that met less than half an hour earlier. And he's touching me again and I feel his fingers near my vagina and then suddenly his fingers are gone and his fucking dick is inside of me and my body slumps like a scruffed cat. I'm lying there, I'm a body, just a body, I'm frozen, he's thrusting into me and I can't believe this is happening and he tosses my body around like I'm not even a person underneath all this flesh. I don't know how much time passes. It feels like a minute or two. He doesn't ask me if I'm okay or if I like this or anything. It's like I'm not even there. And finally I'm able to speak again and I say \"I don't want to do this\". He says \"do you not like me?\" and I can still picture his fucking pathetic face when he asks me this and all of a sudden all I can do is cry and repeat \"I don't even know you I don't even know you\". He says sorry and asks if I want him to leave and I say yes and then he insists that he's going to take me somewhere and I tell him to leave. He asks to use the bathroom and I give him permission and he leaves my house and before I can even get up to lock my door he rings the bell and I realize his sunglasses are on my dresser. I'm wrapped in my comforter and I hold the glasses through the crack in the doorway. Why the fuck do I offer him such courtesy? I shut the door and run back into my room and cry and I want to scream but I don't because I think if I start I'll never be able to stop.\n\nYesterday, the day after, I bought a white pages account and looked up his phone number. He had never told me his last name, just his first name. It turns out it wasn't even his real fucking name. I thought he didn't look Spanish and it's because his name is Pakistani. And when you Google his name it looks like he got married a little over a month ago. He's a rapist and a liar and a piece of shit and I'm so fucking angry.",

So my friend set me up on a blind date recently (yes, because I was gonna be alone on Valentine's Day and was desperate, judge me lol). She said the guy was nice and good socially and just a good guy all around so I agreed.\n\nThe date had been going fine and  we were just getting to know each other and he asked \"So what kind of woman are you, like a girly-girl or tomboyish or what?\" All I said was that I was a mixed bag and that I was a feminist and didn't really believe there is such a thing as a true girly girl or whatever. I wasn't preachy or anything. He just said \"oh yeah, I guess you're right\" or something like that but i could tell from then on he had lost interest in me and like ten minutes after he got the bill and we left and he didn't ask for my number...\n\nSo I told my friend how it went and she basically said \"have you never talked to a man before? Don't mention feminism!\" I explained the context and she said I should've just said I was a girly girl or else said I didn't know... \n\nSo is this a rule I just never learned?

    "text": "Can't we all just get along? (Long, and rambling, I apologize) Little bit of a rant, and I'm gonna own that I'm also whining a bit, so bear with me. I'm a cath lab nurse, former ICU, CVICU, & ED. Love, love, love my job! I get to make people happy every day: either we fix em and make em happy, or we get to tell them that their heart is perfect, and make em happy (for the most part, we have a few, very, very few sad endings). And NOTHING feels better than saving a STEMI pt in the middle of the night, and making such a huge difference for them! I wish more nurses would join us, we are always short staffed.  Frankly, I think most nurses are too smart to give up their 3-12s for 4 or 5-10s, plus call ;-) I get it, I really do. And when we do get a new nurse, and get her (or him) trained up, they usually leave to do travel assignments and make buckets of money, because cath labs across the country are short staffed and need travelers, it's a vicious cycle. \n\nI'm on call this weekend, and it never fails: we get called by that one nervous ED doc, and cancelled before we finish parking. No pay for our time traveling, no pay for dropping whatever we're doing at home to zoom into work within 30 minutes (I was in my pj's for 2 of my 3 calls so far this weekend, but I feel like it was a win because I remembered a bra). Again, I get it, that's the job I chose. But often, it feels like we're the unloved step children of the hospital. Or, the cardiologist basically says 'screw it, we're here, let's just do the damned thing', and we're doing a basic cath that could've waited until Monday. It might not be life-threatening, but this patient was labelled as a STEMI, and now the floor is getting nervous that they're going to have a STEMI patient that we refused to cath. Even though it wasn't even a NSTEMI, but instead, a guy going through a cardiac work up last week who got nervous waiting for his diagnostic cath next week and had an anxiety attack.  Ugh. But it's not like we can be mad. That's our job...but not really. \n\nHere's what really chaps my hide: we have been working 5 days a week since last summer, trying desperately to find RNs to replace the 4 who left. We're finally back down to 12 days of call a month, from the 20 we were doing, yay we got a traveler!  We're tired. When we get called in 3 times over the weekend, it's hard not to get frustrated by units who refuse to bring a bed to us for when we're finished, or bring the patient to us if they're in-patient, nurses who refuse to take report when we call, and House Supervisors who insist that we recover the STEMI patient because there are 'no beds'. Like, COME ON PEOPLE! \n\nWhether it's 3 am on a weeknight, or 3 pm on a Sunday, we're alone waaaaayyyy out in the cath lab area. There's just our team, and we don't all arrive at once. We have to set up the room and be ready as soon as the patient arrives, because we have a time limit to meet. 90 minutes, door to balloon, and we've already eaten up however much time it took in the ED or on the floor to get things in motion, 30 minutes getting to the hospital, another 15-20 minutes turning on equipment, setting up the room, calling for a quick report, pulling drugs, mixing meds, and throwing the table. That doesn't really leave time to transport, get the patient switched over to our table, and re-do the ekg/cuff/ETCO2/and defib patches, because it all has to be different so as not to be in the way of the xray/sine pics. At this point, the Dr might only have 20 minutes left to get access and maneuver a guide and wire into a tricky spot and balloon it before the stent goes in. 90 minutes seems like a long time, but it's not, especially when the patient's life is on the line. \n\nAfterwards, we still have to be at work the next day, 7 am as always. Or we go home to be on call for the rest of our overnight or weekend shift. When we get called in at 530 am or pm, I know we might get lucky and finish within 2 hours, and I'm sorry that you're going to change shift at 7, but when I call at 650, please don't refuse report and make me wait until 720. My patient is cold and miserable, the family is anxious, and we just want to go home! We still have to clean and mop the room and get it ready for the next STEMI, and we can't start that until the patient leaves. And the patient can't leave until I give report. I'm a good nurse and I do cate about my patient, but a STEMI is a true emergency, and I probably don't know much. I know that the pt is stable, I can tell you what meds I gave, where his IV is, where his stent is, and maybe his allergies. I will probably have to look to tell you the gauge of the IV, because shit was hitting the fan, and I only cared that the IV worked, I didn't notice the size. I can tell you that he collapsed while waiting to catch the train home, and a police officer who knows good CPR was standing right next to him, and his wife is frantic waiting to see him. That's all I got. That's all I can tell you. I won't take 2 minutes of your time, and I can transport the patient, tuck him in, and take your 1st set of vitals by the time you finish shift change. I'll even go over orders with you, and remind you how to handle a TR band if its been a while. Or, I'll ask the Dr to place a seal in the femoral artery, so you don't have to pull a sheath (and I won't get paged in 4 hours later, because you're too busy to pull it, grrrr).\n\nAnd please don't treat me, or my techs, like we're dumb. The techs in the cath lab aren't \"techs\" in the sense of the word that they're nurse helpers. No, they kinda run the cath lab world. They are highly trained in cardiology, with an RT or XRay degree, plus extra CVT training (Cardio-Vascular Technologist), or they graduated from a CVT school. They can make more money than RNs, lol, and they are often 'in charge' or the manager. They take the same credentialing test as RNs, the RCIS, which gives them the right to circulate patients. They don't do conscious sedation, that's the only difference. They can handle all the drips and meds the ICU deals with. They are ACLS certified. The Dr's rely on them to be an extra set of eyes and hands. In some facilities, they get access in the femoral artery, seal arteries, and pull or place catheters. They may even be allowed to perform most of a diagnostic cath, though that is rare these days, but that's a big ol political thing I won't get into. Just know, they are safe and smart and highly educated. They can run circles around most nurses. They don't \"assist\" me. Techs are my teammates and my equals, with more cardiovascular knowledge in their little fingers than most nurses will ever hope to have (including me, but I'm getting there, lol). And just because I couldn't give you a full head to toe report, please don't roll your eyes. I did my job with what I had. I'm not a bedside nurse anymore, and I often don't have access or time to look for any of the information you need. I think *YOU* are awesome. Please recognize that I'm still one of you, but with an extremely focused job that requires something very different from what you're able to do as a bedside nurse. \n\nSo, long story short: please recognize that while we understand the difficulty of taking a report right at shift change, or the frustration of getting another admission, my job is sometimes 24/7, and I'm ready to go home and eat my dinner 3 hours late, or see my kids, or get 2 hours sleep, before I get called in again.  I don't want to hold a patient, all alone with 1 other nurse, in a recovery area that's shut down and empty for the night or weekend, for any amount of time (yes, I have those bad-ass techs on my team, but they don't count as nurses, they can't monitor a patient after the procedure is over, only *during* a procedure. They have to clock out and leave). I came in and did my job, now I want to clock out and go home, too, before it starts all over again. I swear it's not a dump and run. We know you've got this, please take it from here asap!\n\nI'd really appreciate it if you could find a little empathy for your cath lab brothers and sisters. We don't mean to be grumpy, or pushy. We don't mean to come across as abrasive. We're probably just tired, and feeling a little bit misunderstood, unappreciated, and unloved. And I suppose we make you feel the same way, sometimes, too! As for myself, I'm the nurse who's always smiling and joking with you, because dammit, we're going to make a nursing connection whether you like it or not, and you're going to be my buddy who 'knows me', and knows that I won't ever screw you over, because I was once in your shoes, and I totally get where you're coming from! How the hell do you think I ended up in the cath lab? Became friendly with the cardiologist, one of my favorite people, became *his* go-to post-cath nurse in the ICU, then became the STEMI nurse in the ICU when we went interventional, got bamboozled by the funny, nice cath lab folks, and *boom*, let them lead me down a path straight into the cath lab. Darn them all to heck! And now I'm the CCL educator, getting new nurses from the floor who shadow me every Wednesday. (Don't even get me started on new RNs, I love them so much, getting them on-board the cath lab train, to bridge a greater team work and understanding in the years to come, is so much fun and makes me look forward to Wednesdays!)\n\nIf you're still with me, thank you for hanging in there and letting me vent and blow off a little steam. It probably didn't help that when I tried to call report today, for the 4th time, the day nurse forgot to put me on hold while she and the night nurse complained about the cath lab. I do feel a bit petty, because I was once that nurse, I hate to admit. Always feeling put upon by the specialty areas who just couldn't wait one damned minute (or 40) for me to get settled into my shift! Anyways, please understand that I just needed someone to listen, and not judge too harshly, and I'm keeping this up, though I probably shouldn't because I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers or throw shade (though maybe I did a tiny bit). I want us all to show some mutual respect, is that too much to ask? I'm going to start with me, and say that I know I couldn't do what I do, without the nurses in the ED who start the process and the nurses \"upstairs\" who take over where my job leaves off. Thank you for every time you've taken a cath lab patient, and know that you ARE appreciated for the great job you do!  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: any patient scenarios are made up or exaggerated to protect identities, obviously ;-)",

    "text": "Why I Teach History (7th grade) I’m pretty routinely asked why I bother teaching.  Specifically, people almost always ask why I chose to teach Middle School History.  After all, it is in the past and the kids don’t really care any way.  To try and get to the bottom of that question, I gave an alternative prompt on our most recent large test.  It was inspired but stories from a long-time family friend’s favorite teacher.  The kids, if they wanted to, could write about “What they learned in 7th Grade World History.”  This isn’t supposed to be a humblebrag or back-patting session.  I was just so amazed by what some of my students wrote that I want to share it with all of you.  This is why teachers teach.\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who has been quiet all year.**\n\n\n   I learned a lot more in 7th grade history than just numbers and dates.  I learned how to think deeper about things, I learned more about why you shouldn’t judge someone by their race, and I learned that history happens all the time.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I learned to think deeper.  In the past, I never really thought about the meaning of some of the holidays or why history matters, but now I know that they actually have an important meaning.  I’ve also been way more interested in history.  I want to know about everything, especially when my parents are talking about stuff.\n\n\n   I learned a lot more about why people shouldn’t judge others by the color of their skin.  I learned that it is about more than because its racist and wrong, its also because were all equal.  No one is superior.  Some may think the Europeans are better and smarter than the Meso-Americans but that’s not true because the Meso-Americans also have amazing buildings and creations, such as temples and floating gardens.\n\n\n   History happens all the time.  I used to think that history was just people that changed the world but history also happens in my own life. History is being made everyday, even when we don’t know that it is.  There are also different types of history, such as personal history, world history, and even Internet history.  We probably see a piece of history everyday and we don’t even know it.\n\n\n   In 7th grade history, I’ve learned that you should think deeper, don’t judge people by their looks, and history is being made everyday.  History is importance because it teaches us what to do and what not do do.  It shows up past mistakes so we know to not repeat them.  Therefore, I have a lot more in 7th grade history than just dates\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – By an anonymous student who now comes during break to talk about history.**\n\n7th grade World History was one of the most importance experiences of my life.  This class taught me many things that I will remember forever.  It taught me how working hard has it’s benefits, how you should always think about things more carefully, and most importantly, it taught me one of the most important concepts that everyone should learn.\n\nIn this class, the teacher would always push us to do better and always made sure we were doing our best work.  At the beginning of the school year, I found this annoying because I didn’t think I would benefit from it.  I just thought the teacher was too strict about the quality of work.  Now I realize the benefits of this.  It will help me throughout the rest of my life because most things in life, especially when you get a job, need you to do your best and work your hardest to be successful.\n\nThe teacher also taught me the importance of thinking carefully about things.  He taught me this by tricking our classes to see if we would notice he was lying.  Almost every time I fell for his tricks and this taught me to think more closely about things.  Thinking more closely about things will help my everyday life just like always working my hardest will.\n\nLastly, this class taught me about why we care about African civilizations.  This was an important lesson because it showed me how biased our opinions of West African cultures are because they are influenced by European ideas.  This concept will help me educate others on this topic because many do not realize this.  It is the most important thing that I have learned so far in my school career.  Many others need to learn this too.\n\nThis year in 7th grade was very important to me.  It taught me so many important lessons that I will remember forever.  It taught me the importance of thinking closely and working my hardest.  It also taught me about why our opinions on the African cultures are biased and the importance of learning and teaching their true story.  This class will help me in so many ways for years to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n**What I learned in 7th Grade World History – An Anonymous student that sent 10-20 emails to me over the last two quarters, trying to solve the question of “Why we care?” with no points involved.**\n\n\n\nLearning of the Meso-American and African societies is part of the seventh grade standards, but it is often not told the way it really happened.  The takeover and destruction of these civilizations probes the importance of history and the complexity of people and their actions in history.  The reasons the horrendous actions of the Europeans are still accepted are guilt and faulty reasoning, the lack of purely good and bad people, and bias/lack of enthusiasm in history today.  The repetition of these issues in other situations, even slightly, happens over and over in history and the modern day.\n\n\n\nWhen the Europeans arrived and encountered Meso American or African civilizations, they were quick to declare superiority.  Their first reaction to the confusion of the other people was to assume that they were stupid and had no culture.  When it became apparent that they could use these people to their own advantage, they decided that the best way to relieve the guilt was to make the non-Europeans inhuman.  This creates the illusion that killing and enslaving people was much less cruel than it should be, as they were not people at all.  This idea is used over and over again by thousands of people.  Essentially making the victims of evil actions into people who shouldn’t be seen as victims, thus the actions are no longer evil.  It is seen in history and it is seen now, and being aware of it gives one the ability to properly understand the actions of others.\n\n\n\nThat being said, most who cover up what they are doing do not think they need to cover it up.  Most people legitimately believe that what they are doing is for the greater good, including the Europeans when doing their pillaging.  King Leopold infamously believed that what he was doing benefited the Africans.  It goes to show that humans are never purposely trying to be bad.  Even if they are aware of their cruel actions, they believe that their reasons are good and that what they are doing is just.  There is no such thing as a purely good or purely evil person.\n\n\n\nThe true story of the enslavement and slaughter of the Meso-Americans and the West Africans is often quieted or ignored for the same reasons as displayed above: guilt, excuses, and the honest belief that what the Europeans did was okay.  Without seeing every side of this incredibly complex story, one would be just as ignorant as the Europeans.  It is important to try as hard as possible to become unbiased and open-minded.  This sentiment applies to everything in life.  Surrounding oneself with diverse opinions and views of the world is the fastest way to eliminate ignorance.  One can’t just listen to whoever’s voice is the loudest.\n\n\n\nThe reason why we care about the Meso-American and African civilizations is complex on its own, but it connects to outside issues and the entirety of human nature.  It teaches one how to be an intelligent, less biased member of our society and most significantly, how important history is to achieve this.",

    "text": "[Inner city] [US History/8th grade] - Black vs African-American? I'm white. For the past four years, I've been teaching 8th grade in a school where 90% of the students are black. I've only taught ELA, but when something comes up regarding race and I say \"black\", someone will cheekily say \"it's AFRICAN-AMERICAN!\", or when I say \"African-American,\" someone will cheekily say \"Just say BLACK, I'm not from Africa!\"\n\nIn reality, I just mix it up based on what sounds better in the given sentence. I probably say \"black\" more because African-American is hard to say with a lot of syllables. But I have some sensitive students that take themselves pretty seriously, so I'm trying to avoid angry parent phone calls this year.\n\nThis is my first time teaching U.S. history so race is going to come up a lot. I want to explain from the start what I just said here, but I really have no right to tell them \"You shouldn't be offended by black!\" or \"Most of you aren't even from Africa, so I'm not using African-American!\"\n\nAny advice? Should I just accept there will be complaints either way and ignore them like I do with most petty complaints?\n\nOther info if it matters:\n\n* In a major northeast city\n\n* Most teachers are white\n\n* Right on the border of a very white neighborhood, so most kids are pretty racially desensitized\n\n* About two kids a year will angrily call me a cracker, so racism is still there a bit",

    "text": "My Dad was a principle for 25+ years in the private system and the international system. He had some sage advise for me going through parent teacher interviews for the first time. Im posting because his advise to me as a new teacher was supper helpful I thought it would be helpful for others as well.  Posting my email to him as well to give his response some context.  \n\nMY EMAIL:\n\nI'm pretty taxed mentally trying to stay atop of teaching my courses and I'm now very emotionally and mentally taxed dealing with these parent teacher conferences. I had 1 hr today of meetings but tomorrow I have just under 4hrs of meetings.\n\nI'm just looking for some words of wisdom or some mantras to hold on to as I go through tomorrow.\n\nI'm taking notes in each meeting for follow up and am enjoying aspects of them.\n\nI also feel like I don't know the kids enough to properly judge or give advice to their parents on things that are more behavioural or psychological entrenched due to nurture. I should do more teacher student conferencing I think.  But yeah, the parents seem more concerned with \"how do I handle my child.\"  Some good parents thrown in the mix there too though who seem to be taking care of business.\n\nLooking forward to tomorrows challenge but nervous to remain in self control all the same.\n\n\nHIS RESPONSE:\n\nYeah, parent teachers can be a very trying time. Parents are always looking for some kind of a  magic bullet that will make parenting easier. I think in reality they know there is no magic bullet parenting is hard and they still hope to find that bullet. \n\nThe main thing for you to do is like you saying in you’re fourth paragraph. You don’t really have any answers for them because it is early in the year for you. Just remain positive  and remind them that you are both there to talk about their child’s academic progress in your subject area. That’s probably the best advice I can give you. It’s always good to affirm the parents That their concerns are valid and that you know they just want to be better parents. That’s where you can relate to them by saying I’m trying to be a better teacher too. Point out to them how you see their your child in the classroom and the good things you see there. Always encourage them to be consistant as much as possible. \n\nProbably the best mantras I can think of for parents is “let’s keep working at this together”. “this too shall pass” or “I will remain positive”.  It’s also good to remember that these parents are going to meet with three or four other teachers. You’re just one of the teachers that they’re going to dump on this afternoon. \n\n If you hear anything that really concerns you you might suggest that the parents set up an appointment with your school counsellor. \n\nJust enjoy them. You will learn a lot about the kids and the families they come from. That will help you  to be a better teacher.  Parent-teacher interviews can be trying time but it’s also a great learning experience. Don’t be too hard on your self and have fun with it. \n\n\nTL;DR “let’s keep working at this together”. “this too shall pass” or “I will remain positive”.  Don’t be too hard on your self and have fun with it.",

    "text": "Mathematician considering industry jobs, how do I proceed? I originally wrote this post as a question on a thread for/r/math, but I thought it might do well here. Let me know if there are any bits that are unclear, as I was originally asking the question to an audience that had spent at least some time in academia, and as such some of the jargon might not translate so well. Thanks!\n\nBegin content:\n\nI just matriculated with my Ph.D. in pure math (combinatorics, graph theory) and an MSc.  in Computer Science. My career ambition was (is) research-y academia (think a 2-2 teaching load at a good 4 year school, with either the presence of master's students or a strong undergraduate research program). My CV is  good for someone in this phase in my career ( above average number of publications, diverse author group, a good mix of strong journals, some work with undergrads led  by me) along with a good teaching record. The search was a partial success, with a few tenure track interviews and short-listings for some research post docs. Ultimately, I wound up with a visiting assistant professor position (2-3 teaching load) which is quite nice. However,  it's a temporary position and my passion is research, ultimately. So I'm going to be on the market for the next few years, and it has occurred to me that I should broaden my search a bit this year to include jobs that are intellectually satisfying that might not be strictly math research. Otherwise, I might wind up 'settling for' a teaching job. I don't mean anything bad against teaching jobs, I just mean that I would prefer a job with more of a research component even if I get less creative control vs. a job where teaching consumes all of my time. \n\nThe last two particulars before my specific questions:\n\n1. ) My coding skills are not those of a software engineer. I've taught intro to java, but most of my experience on the grad level is coding to work on combinatorics problems (python/sage), a parallel processing class, some scientific computing (MATLAB), and a few courses that required some tough C coding (that I had to teach myself). It would be best to think of me as a good problem solver who is familiar with coding and is good at pounding his head on his keyboard until stackexchange helps. \n\n2.) I have a two body problem. My wife was pretty much willing to move wherever I got a post doc. Now that I have one, and her career is another year advanced, the standard for us packing up gets higher each year. I know how to apply for jobs on the academic market, but some of my questions below will discuss how to address this regarding the private sector. \n\n3.) Math is a small world. If you have recognized me, don't take this as a total departure from academia, or as bailing on my current position which is designed to have me on the market for the next 3 years! Just trying to broaden my horizons a bit in the smartest possible ways. \n\nMy specific questions about non-academic jobs:\n\n1.) What sorts of jobs are well suited for folks like me? I know the NSA, and there are national labs (but without an in with the scientific communities, I am skeptical about being mote competitive than I am on the academic market). I know words like 'tech' and 'data science' as industries, and I know a little about machine learning (more theory,  and I have seen applications that made sense), but if I contacted any of these places, I would be a little clueless about how to describe which jobs I would be interested in. In fact, I would probably need them to tell me what's what. This is starkly contrasted with my academic applications which are largely driven by my research statement where I very specifically outline my research program for the next few years. \n\n2.) There are a few cities that would be nice to live in (familiarity,  family and friends, etc.). How do you figure out those private industry jobs that have presences in those cities, and look for openings just there? For example, one such city is Charlotte, which has a Microsoft campus. But I don't know what they do there, and if they would need a mathematician. Given that each year my pass at the private market will be more and more thorough, being picky about location feels like at least a first pass while I stay on the academic market. A job offer in a desirable city might provide incentive for my wife to move, as well.\n\n3.) When do i apply these places if I'm looking to start May - August next summer? \n\n4.) Any good resources for converting a c.v. to a resume? How important is the cardinality and strength of my publications? Mine are not a problem, but in academia \"this many to these journals\" is how you sell it. What are the criteria by which these folks judge those things?\n\n5.) Are there any questions that I was too ignorant to even ask? Is there a more appropriate subreddit or FAQ for \"I wanted to do research and I'm slipping onto the teaching track\"? Any other general advise for early career mathematicians like me that might want a change of pace or who might have temporary positions with a need to broaden horizons?\n\n\nThanks! I hope this wasn't too much of a wall of text, I am traveling but saw this thread and had to post via mobile.",

So take anything I say with a grain of salt.\n\n**I can't understand If just really suck, or is my job that sucks.** \n\nI'm not one of those 10x coders. I'm just a regular guy that is in is last year of computer science and also works at a ~~software~~ technology company (we are a small (10-15) company people that gets outsourced to build 'solutions' for cheap to large enterprises that are to stupid and bureaucratic to change a config file in less then 15 days), but I really like coding, I read about code, and the industry, and the new frameworks, and follow the tweets and HN and I don't really see doing anything else.\n\nThe problem is that in the last months I was assigned to a new project, to make a mobile app to be the interface to one of those old database applications, in with the workflow was based on pen and paper, excel spreadsheets and a some client to insert the values into the database. \n\nFirst I was assigned to copy the UI/UX that the client wanted into to the app, all the time I was super pressured, and I was told that we were super late. Three days before the first milestone my boss realised that we didn't need all the UI done but just one workflow, but required more then just mock objects and data, so I had to work overnight in those days to deliver it. All of this time he complained that I was doing it way to slow, and if I was doing an all nighter It was my fault for working to slowly. So he went and presented it and they love, and praised us for how much we could do in so little time. \n\nAfter that I had to start integrating the application with our backend with I need to develop, using lots of technologies that I never worked before, and with I was told that was going to be explained, but no one ever had the time to, so I had to hack it together. And also with the client database, with was constantly changing, and was a job that need lots of inputs from my boss, to chose how to approach it but he was never available.\n\nAlso we never had a meeting just to design the application, and yet a didn't know the full requirements of the application, never talked directly to the client and was constantly told to just implement it. Yet I kept hearing how slow I was doing, with I can't even judge if i'ts true or not, because honestly I was stuck in problems that where rather easy and I got suck in them for days, but my boss never had the time to help me. Additionally I had lot's of problems with the framework that I had to work (ionic burn in hell), lot's of scripts that didn't run properly, and stuff not compiling, that also delayed my progress. And I know also my code wasn't really that clean and easy to maintain. I tried using not mixing responsibilities and using patterns, but maybe I was overwhelmed by being my first project in that programming language and my first solo project?\n\nI'm honestly don't know how can I improve, and I don't know if i'm just programming really slowly, our project had really tight deadlines or I just screw it up to much. Yet my boss keep complaining. I don't even earn that well, but I want to leave with a good legacy of being a great programmer, not some shitty tier programmer. \n\nHe might also have this impression of me because every time he seats on behind me to help me with something, he just yells all the time and complains with makes me nervous, and I try to work even faster, and a screw all the shortcuts up with makes him even more upset and is just a pity scene.  \n\n**TL;DR: I can't understand If I'm just really slow at my work, or the schedules are really tight, or I make to many mistakes. How do I self evaluate? And how to improve?**",

My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

I'm Chinese - and China has been stereotyped as the world's sweatshop, people with weird eyes, dog eaters and other undesirable things. I also grew up an Asian American, who didn't see race until late high school, but before I could fully understand it, I went back home to China. \n\nMy mom used to microwave vegetable buns she bought from Chinatown for my lunch and I used to bring all sorts of Chinese food for lunch. It got to a point where even other Asians in class started blaming me whenever they smelled something funky. I never once assumed that the way I looked or the food I ate was weird because that's who I was, though luckily for me, nobody made a big deal out of it because I grew up in a diverse neighborhood.\n\nBut as I grew older and traveled beyond my racially diverse, lower-middle class coastal American city, I've noticed that I've slowly become the \"other\" in society. I've begun slight changes in the way people approached me, a certain coldness or strangers acting weirdly confident around me because they assumed or knew I wasn't a local.\n\nWell, I now live in China and I'm past the age where anger was my response to the world. I've accepted that this is the way things are, and all I can say is - it's made things a lot easier for me. I'm a Chinese person who speaks great English and that's who I am - no more dwelling on what my cultural identity is or how I should change who I am just so I can fit in with everyone else. I don't have to be sorry for being Chinese abroad or the fact that I speak great English in China, and I do feel sorry for anyone who doesn't agree. What's there to lose? They'll judge you anyway, do as you wish.\n\nEven though I live in China now, I am still a citizen of another country in the anglosphere, and through that I hope to retain my Westernized Asian identity to the best I can. I also hope I can make friends with other non-Asians who settle in China, but only if they show they have a basic respect of the local culture. I also hope that, through charitable organizations, I can support non-Chinese, non-Han minorities who are born and raised here but sadly isolated from the rest of our society. Is it only because of my experience as an Asian American do I understand what it means to be \"other\", and I am better because of it.\n\nI will respect you when I'm in your house, and you will too when you're in mine - but I will make no concessions regarding who I am, and that applies wherever I go. Place your two feet firmly on the ground and make the world move for you. \n\nIt's that simple.",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 4: \"Sisterhood is still powerful\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n**\"Sisterhood is still powerful\"**\n\nWhen the slogan “Sisterhood is powerful” was first used, it was awesome. I began my full-fledged participation in feminist movement my sophomore year in college. Attending an all women’s college for a year before I transferred to Stanford University, I knew from firsthand experience the difference in female self-esteem and self-assertion in same-sex classrooms versus those where males were present. At Stanford males ruled the day in every classroom. Females spoke less, took less initiative, and often when they spoke you could hardly hear what they were saying. Their voices lacked strength and confidence. And to make matters worse we were told time and time again by male professors that we were not as intelligent as the males, that we could not be “great” thinkers, writers, and so on. These attitudes shocked me since I had come from an all-female environment where our intellectual worth and value was constantly affirmed by the standard of academic excellence our mostly female professors set for us and themselves.\n\n\n\nIndeed, I was indebted to my favorite white female English professor who thought I was not getting the academic guidance I needed at our women’s college because they did not have an intensified writing program. She encouraged me to attend Stanford. She believed that I would someday be an important thinker and writer.\n\n\n\nAt Stanford my ability was constantly questioned. I began to doubt myself. Then feminist movement rocked the campus. Female students and professors demanded an end to discrimination based on gender inside and outside the classroom. Wow, it was an intense and awesome time. There I took my first women’s studies class with the writer Tillie Olsen, who compelled her students to think first and foremost about the fate of women from working-class backgrounds. There the scholar and one-day biographer of Anne Sexton, Diane Middlebrook, passed out one of my poems in our class on contemporary poetry with no name on it and asked us to identify whether the writer was male or female, an experiment that made us think critically about judging the value of writing on the basis of gender biases. There I began to write my first book at the age of 19, Ain’t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism. None of these incredible transformations would have happened without feminist movement creating a foundation for solidarity between women.\n\n\n\nThat foundation rested on our critique of what we then called “the enemy within,” referring to our internalized sexism. We all knew firsthand that we had been socialized as females by patriarchal thinking to see ourselves as inferior to men, to see ourselves as always and only in competition with one another for patriarchal approval, to look upon each other with jealousy, fear, and hatred. Sexist thinking made us judge each other without compassion and punish one another harshly. Feminist thinking helped us unlearn female self-hatred. It enabled us to break free of the hold patriarchal thinking had on our consciousness.\n\n\n\nMale bonding was an accepted and affirmed aspect of patriarchal culture. It was simply assumed that men in groups would stick together, support one another, be team players, place the good of the group over individual gain and recognition. Female bonding was not possible within patriarchy; it was an act of treason. Feminist movement created the context for female bonding. We did not bond against men, we bonded to protect our interests as women. When we challenged professors who taught no books by women, it was not because we did not like those professors (we often did); rightly, we wanted an end to gender biases in the classroom and in the curriculum.\n\n\n\nThe feminist transformations that were taking place in our coed college in the early ‘70s were taking place as well in the world of home and work. First and foremost feminist movement urged females to no longer see ourselves and our bodies as the property of men. To demand control of our sexuality, effective birth control and reproductive rights, an end to rape and sexual harassment, we needed to stand in solidarity. In order for women to change job discrimination we needed to lobby as a group to change public policy. Challenging and changing female sexist thinking was the first step towards creating the powerful sisterhood that would ultimately rock our nation.\n\n\n\nFollowing in the wake of civil rights revolution feminist movement in the ‘70s and ‘80s changed the face of our nation. The feminist activists who made these changes possible cared for the well-being of all females. We understood that political solidarity between females expressed in sisterhood goes beyond positive recognition of the experiences of women and even shared sympathy for common suffering. Feminist sisterhood is rooted in shared commitment to struggle against patriarchal injustice, no matter the form that injustice takes. Political solidarity between women always undermines sexism and sets the stage for the overthrow of patriarchy. Significantly, sisterhood could never have been possible across the boundaries of race and class if individual women had not been willing to divest of their power to dominate and exploit subordinated groups of women. As long as women are using class or race power to dominate other women, feminist sisterhood cannot be fully realized.\n\n\n\nAs more women begin to opportunistically lay claim to feminism in the ‘80s without undergoing the feminist consciousness-raising that would have enabled them to divest of their sexism, the patriarchal assumption that the powerful should rule over the weak informed their relations to other women. As women, particularly previously disenfranchised privileged white women, began to acquire class power without divesting of their internalized sexism, divisions between women intensified. When women of color critiqued the racism within the society as a whole and called attention to the ways that racism had shaped and informed feminist theory and practice, many white women simply turned their backs on the vision of sisterhood, closing their minds and their hearts. And that was equally true when it came to the issue of classism among women.I remember when feminist women, mostly white women with class privilege, debated the issue of whether or not to hire domestic help, trying to come up with a way to not participate in the subordination and dehumanization of less-privileged women. Some of those women successfully created positive bonding between themselves and the women they hired so that there could be mutual advancement in a larger context of inequality. Rather than abandoning the vision of sisterhood, because they could not attain some utopian state, they created a real sisterhood, one that took into account the needs of everyone involved. This was the hard work of feminist solidarity between women. Sadly, as opportunism within feminism intensified, as feminist gains became commonplace and were therefore taken for granted, many women did not want to work hard to create and sustain solidarity.\n\n\n\nA large body of women simply abandoned the notion of sisterhood. Individual women who had once critiqued and challenged patriarchy re-aligned themselves with sexist men. Radical women who felt betrayed by the fierce negative competition between women often simply retreated. And at this point feminist movement, which was aimed at positively transforming the lives of all females, became more stratified. The vision of sisterhood that had been the rallying cry of the movement seemed to many women to no longer matter. Political solidarity between women which had been the force putting in place positive change has been and is now consistently undermined and threatened. As a consequence we are as in need of a renewed commitment to political solidarity between women as we were when contemporary feminist movement first began.\n\n\n\nWhen contemporary feminist movement first began we had a vision of sisterhood with no concrete understanding of the actual work we would need to do to make political solidarity a reality. Through experience and hard work, and, yes, by learning from our failures and mistakes, we now have in place a body of theory and shared practice that can teach new converts to feminist politics what must be done to create, sustain, and protect our solidarity. Since masses of young females know little about feminism and many falsely assume that sexism is no longer the problem, feminist education for critical consciousness must be continuous. Older feminist thinkers cannot assume that young females will just acquire knowledge of feminism along the way to adulthood. They require guidance. Overall women in our society are forgetting the value and power of sisterhood. Renewed feminist movement must once again raise the banner high to proclaim anew “Sisterhood is powerful.”\n\n\n\nRadical groups of women continue our commitment to building sisterhood, to making feminist political solidarity between women an ongoing reality. We continue the work of bonding across race and class. We continue to put in place the anti-sexist thinking and practice which affirms the reality that females can achieve self-actualization and success without dominating one another. And we have the good fortune to know everyday of our lives that sisterhood is concretely possible, that sisterhood is still powerful.",

One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "Ontological Commitments, Sex and Gender, by Mari Mikkola Excerpt from \"Feminist Metaphysics - Explorations in the Ontology of Sex, Gender and the Self\", edited by Charlotte Witt.\n\n***\n\n\n**Abstract**\n\n\nThis chapter develops an alternative for (what feminists call) “the sex/gender distinction”. I do so in order to avoid certain problematic implications the distinction underpins. First, the sex/gender distinction paradigmatically holds that some social conditions determine one’s gender (whether one is a woman or a man), and that some biological conditions determine one’s sex (whether one is female or male). Further, sex and gender come apart. Taking gender as socially constructed, this implies that women exist mind-dependently, or due to productive human social activities; thus, it should be possible to do away with them just by altering the social conditions on which gender depends. In addition, some feminists take gender to depend on oppressive social conditions. Changing our social environments, then, would not only unwittingly eradicate women; doing away with women should be feminism’s political goal. I argue that both implications are unacceptable. In response, I argue for a view that is more congenial to ordinary thinking and that doesn’t have the goal of eradicating women.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis chapter develops a model, which I will call “the trait/norm covariance model”, as an alternative for understanding the phenomena feminists usually discuss under the rubric of the sex/gender distinction. This well-known distinction gives rise to certain problems that motivate the formulation of my alternative model. Specifically, I have in mind here problems arising from the conventionalist and abolitionist implications that the distinction underpins. First, consider the conventionalist implications: paradigmatically, some social conditions must be met in order for one to count as a woman or a man because gender is (as the slogan goes) socially constructed. One need not satisfy any biological or anatomical conditions; they are relevant only for counting as female or male. On this understanding “woman” and “man” are used as gender terms, “female” and “male” as sex terms.  The implication is that women and men exist mind-dependently or due to productive human social activities: that there are women and men ontologically depends on some social institutions and agents, their beliefs, practices and/or conventions in that women and men could not exist unless the relevant institutions, practices and conventions (with conscious agents upholding them) existed. Women and men are akin to wives, husbands and US senators that also depend on us for their existence.  This being so, it should be possible to do away with women and men while leaving the individuals we call “women” and “men” otherwise intact–we simply alter those social conditions on which gender depends so that individuals no longer count as women and men. Consider a parallel to US senators: their existence depends on certain sociopolitical conventions so that were a political revolution to alter those conventions by abolishing the US Senate, US senators would literally vanish overnight. Those individuals who previously counted as US senators would no longer do so despite being otherwise physically intact (presuming the revolution were a bloodless one). Just as one need not execute US senators in order to eradicate them, the thought is, eradicating women and men does not require physically altering those individuals we think of as women and men. Second, consider the abolitionist implication: in addition to holding a conventionalist view, some feminists take gender to depend ontologically on oppressive social conditions. As a result, changing our social environments would not only unwittingly eradicate women and men: doing away with gender should be feminism’s political goal.  \n\n\nAs I see it, both implications are problematic and ones that many ordinary social agents are unwilling to accept. Ordinarily, women are thought to be human females, men human males. As a result, their existence is not thought to depend on productive human social conventions, practices and institutions so that we could abolish women and men leaving intact females and males simply by altering our social landscapes. Conventionalist implications, then, are unintuitive. Further, ordinary social agents often find the abolitionist implication that “after the revolution” women and men will no longer exist objectionable. Many of my students, along with other feminist philosophers, do not see being a woman or a man as problematic per se. Rather, the problem is how we are viewed and treated as women and men. For ordinary thinking, then, the idea that feminists should aim to do away with women and men harbors undesirable ontological commitments.\n\nThese problems are generated by a clash between the paradigmatic feminist and everyday conceptions of sex and gender. Ordinary thinking does not separate sex and gender in the way many feminists do, thus neither seeing the existence of women and men as mind-dependent nor holding that gender is something to be eradicated. We can avoid this clash in one of two ways: either feminists work hard to modify everyday conceptions of sex and gender so that they are in line with the conventionalist and abolitionist views, or feminists modify their conceptions of sex and gender so that they are closer to everyday thinking. Here I will endorse the latter option and propose a way to conceptualize the phenomena usually discussed under the sex/gender distinction to avoid the unintuitive and undesirable ontological commitments. I will do so by developing what I will call “the trait/norm covariance model” to replace the usual sex/gender distinction. My alternative model will involve redrawing the boundaries of the sets of gender and sex traits and dividing these traits into new sets: descriptive traits (traits of which there is “a fact of the matter”) and evaluative norms (norms that express judgments about descriptive traits). For instance, the paradigmatic gender trait of wearing make-up and the paradigmatic sex trait of having ovaries will both count as descriptive traits (one either has ovaries/regularly wears make-up or not). But, my model also acknowledges the influence of social norms: certain evaluations (like being judged to act, be or appear “feminine”) can be seen to covary with particular descriptive traits, which accounts for why some traits are supposedly appropriate for women and others for men.4\n\n \n\n\n4\nBy way of illustration, I will consider Sally Haslanger’s fascinating and innovative recent account of gender (“Gender and Race”; “Future Genders”; “Social Construction”), which has the conventionalist and abolitionist implications. Next, I will examine what precisely is problematic about these implications in order to motivate my alternative model. I will then outline my trait/norm covariance model, ending with a discussion of how it avoids the problematic ontological commitments considered.\n\n**Haslanger on Gender: An Example**\n\nHaslanger’s account of gender has conventionalist and abolitionist implications: it takes the existence of women and men to be mind-dependent in the sense of depending on human social practices and conventions, and it takes these conventions and practices to be oppressive—for her, since gender is a product of oppressive social forces feminists should aim to eradicate it. These implications are underpinned by a distinction between sex and gender that many feminists have historically endorsed. Paradigmatically: “sex” denotes human females and males depending on some biological features (like chromosomes, sex organs, hormones or other physical features to do with reproduction) whereas “gender” denotes women and men depending on some social factors (like social role, position, behaviour or identity). As is well known, the motivation for drawing the sex/gender distinction was to counter biological determinism that took some (supposedly) biological facts to explain behavioural and psychological differences between women and men. Instead, feminists argued that these differences have social causes. They distinguished biological and social/psychological differences and began using the term “gender” to denote the latter. For instance, Gayle Rubin (who was one of the first feminists to articulate this distinction) used the phrase “sex/gender system” in order to describe “a set of arrangements by which the biological raw material of human sex and procreation is shaped by human, social intervention” (165). For Rubin, although sex differences are fixed, gender differences are the oppressive results of social interventions that dictate how women and men should behave: women are oppressed as women and “by having to be women” (204). For her, gender is the social interpretation of sex and an oppressive one at that. However, women’s oppression is mutable by political and social reform that abolishes gender. As Rubin saw it, feminism should aim to create a “genderless (though not sexless) society, in which one’s sexual anatomy is irrelevant to who one is, what one does, and with whom one makes love” (204).\n\nFor Haslanger, gender is constitutively constructed: in defining it we must make reference to social factors (“Ontology and Social Construction” 98), and, in particular, we must make reference to unequal social positions (“Gender and Race” 37–43). In so doing, Haslanger aims to debunk the ordinary view that gender classification is a matter of anatomy. Commonly, being female is thought to be sufficient for womanhood; Haslanger, on the other hand, takes the conditions for satisfying “woman” to be social rather than biological. Her project involves showing that although the use of the term “woman” is thought to track a group of “individuals defined by a set of physical ... conditions [it] is better understood as capturing a group that occupies a certain ... social position” (“Social Construction” 318). And the social positions that our gendered classification scheme tracks and that make gender ascriptions apt crucially involve reference to subordination and privilege. For Haslanger, societies in general tend to “privilege individuals with male bodies” (“Gender and Race” 38) so that the social positions they subsequently occupy are better than the social positions of those with female bodies. And this generates sexist injustices. For her:\n\n>S is a woman if [by definition] S is systematically subordinated along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n\n>S is a man if [by definition] S is systematically privileged along some dimension (economic, political, legal, social, etc.), and S is “marked” as a target for this treatment by observed or imagined bodily features presumed to be evidence of a male’s biological role in reproduction (“Future Genders” 6–7).\n\nThese are constitutive of being a woman or a man: what makes calling S a woman apt is not that S is female, but that S is oppressed on sex-marked grounds; what makes calling S a man apt is not that S is male, but that S is privileged on sex-marked grounds.\n\nHaslanger acknowledges that debunking projects like hers sometimes require a “radical change in our thinking” (“Social Construction” 319). After all, her proposal is counterintuitive: privileged females like, arguably, the Queen of England would not count as women on this view. But Haslanger’s project does not aim to capture what ordinary language users intuitively have in mind and her aim is not to illuminate our commonsense understandings of gender terms. Haslanger’s analysis is, in her terms, ameliorative: it aims to elucidate which gender concepts best help feminists achieve their legitimate purposes thereby elucidating those concepts feminists should be using (“Gender and Race” 33).  That is, endorsing her classification scheme is a pragmatic political choice. And (Haslanger holds) feminists should choose her account of gender since it will be helpful in feminist fights against sexist injustices enabling feminists to identify and explain persistent inequalities between women and men in terms of their social positions. Insofar as Haslanger takes being a woman to be a social matter crucially tied to oppression, she holds that “it is part of the project of feminism to bring about a day when there are no more women (though, of course, we should not aim to do away with females!)” (“Gender and Race” 46). Since what it is to be a woman is by definition tied to sexist oppression, gender justice would eradicate women by abolishing those social structures that are responsible for sex-marked oppression. Women and men could not exist, unless sexist oppression existed; that women and men exist is mind-dependent being the result of oppressive human social activities. And feminism’s goal should be to dismantle those social structures responsible for gender and, by extension, women and men.\n\nProblems with the Conventionalist and Abolitionist Implications\n\nEarlier I claimed that ordinary thinking finds the conventionalist and abolitionist implications of accounts like Haslanger’s problematic. I also claimed that these problems are underpinned by a clash between different conceptions of sex and gender. Let’s examine the worries in more detail.\n\nThe Conventionalist View Is Unintuitive\n\nFor Haslanger (among others) gender depends on something social and not on anything biological. This prima facie makes being a woman ontologically on a par with being a US senator, a wife or a landlord. And, it seems, just as one can cease to be a wife by changing one’s social relations (by getting a divorce), one should be able to cease to be a woman by changing those social relations constitutive of womanhood. But a closer examination suggests that being a woman is not ontologically on a par with (say) being a wife. To tease this out, consider the following claims:\n\n(1)\tFor a week last summer, James was a woman.\n\n(2)\tFor a week last summer, James was a US senator.\n\nThese statements take “woman” and “US senator” as social notions. The first takes womanhood to be about easily perceptible gender markers like clothing and appearance (James lived “as a woman” for a week last summer). The second takes James to have been treated in ways that enabled him to count as a US senator for a week (for instance, James was elected to the US Senate, but due to a political scandal lost his position very quickly). Now, consider:\n\n(3)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a woman.\n\n(4)\tAfter seeing John’s body, I realised that John is a US senator.\n\nThese claims are not about social factors. We can understand claim (3) and it makes sense to us, although we are clearly using “woman” as a biological term. However, when we substitute “woman” for “US senator” in (4), the statement no longer makes sense to us. After all, just by looking at one’s body, it’s not possible to know that one is a US senator. That is, when used as a social term, “woman” is on a par with “US senator”. But we can also use “woman” as a biological term, which makes “woman” and “US senator” come apart. The upshot of this is that “woman” is not a purely social term ; for ordinary thinking, then, being a woman is not on a par ontologically with what it is to be a member of some other social kind. And this suggests that it is not obviously true that women and men’s existence is minddependent in that one can cease to be a woman (or a man) just by altering one’s social environment. Because ordinary thinking does not see being a woman as a purely social matter, conventionalist implications (like the implication that we can eradicate women and men via change in our social environments) are hard to accept. The paradigmatic feminist distinction between sex and gender clashes with everyday thinking. Due to this, ordinary thinking doubts the possibility of eradicating gender via social change, because it ties sex and gender together.\n\nA defender of the conventionalist view might hold that claim (3) doesn’t really make sense either, but we are fooled into believing that it does precisely because ordinary thinking ties sex and gender together when it shouldn’t. So, if we thought about womanhood in the right way, we would see that (3) is also senseless. That would leave claim (1) where “woman” is a social notion making it akin to “US senator”. My worries about unintuitive ontological commitments are dispelled prima facie making it possible for one to cease to be a woman just by altering one’s social environment. But this raises some further questions that the defender of the conventionalist view must answer: Precisely what kind of social change would abolish women and men? Which beliefs, social conventions, linguistic practices and relations would have to be altered for one to no longer count as a woman or a man? And which social institutions, relations and structures would have to be dismantled so that women and men were to cease to exist wholesale? These questions cannot be answered in any intuitively obvious introspective manner. In fact, answering them is the stuff of feminist philosophy and a huge point of contention. Admittedly, this contention may be generated by gender being such an incredibly complex phenomenon that discerning the kind of social change that would eradicate it is extremely difficult; we may simply be ignorant of the kind of change needed, but it is possible to eradicate gender via social change. This may be so. But it may also be that feminists cannot agree on what social changes would do away with women and men because doing so just by altering one’s social environment is not possible. Bluntly put, perhaps it is just plain wrong to think that women and men’s existence ontologically depends on some social factors. I am not concluding that it is; I am merely making a strategic point. The issue of, on which social conditions the existence of women and men depends, is so intractable as to be unhelpful. If gender really is such a complex issue that it is hugely difficult (if not impossible) to articulate and agree on what sort of social change would eradicate it, the most useful move would seem to be to give up the quest. Pragmatically, feminists should not try to uncover which social factors are responsible for the existence of women and men, but, instead, should settle for the much less contentious view that human actions significantly shape the way we are as women and men. No feminist (to the best of my knowledge) denies this claim. The concerns I have raised here are not decisive and do not rule out conventionalism about gender altogether. But, as I see it, the less contentious view I have floated here is the one that feminists ought to endorse precisely because of its less contentious commitments. \n\n**The Abolitionist Implication Is Undesirable**\n\nOn views like Haslanger’s, gender is also a product of oppressive social conditions and, thus, something feminists should seek to abolish. But this abolitionist view may not be conducive to feminist interests since for ordinary thinking it harbours undesirable ontological commitments. To tease this out, contrast such abolitionist strategies with a different (what I will call) “re-evaluative” strategy. They both have the same starting point: feminism is about ending oppression that women as women face. But their ways of achieving this goal differ, which alters the strategies’ outcomes. Abolitionist accounts take womanhood to be by definition tied to oppression so that it is not possible to be a woman and not be (in some sense) oppressed. Reevaluative accounts do not take being a woman to be per se oppressive. Instead, they recognise that our social circumstances create environments where women are viewed and treated in ways that disadvantage them, perhaps by associating some traits with women and using this association to justify disadvantageous treatment. Nonetheless, by altering how women are viewed and treated it is possible to be a woman and yet not be oppressed. So, on the former view, gender justice would dismantle unjust social hierarchies thus doing away with women and men; on the latter, it would dismantle such hierarchies while retaining women and men (roughly) in a re-evaluated sense.\n\nThe strategy to follow comes down to a pragmatic political choice. But if ordinary social agents think that eradicating gender is undesirable, it may be strategically wrongheaded to endorse an account of gender that has abolitionist implications. Some anecdotal evidence supports this: my feminism students tell me time and again that they think the abolitionist strategy is aiming to eradicate something that need not be eradicated—the “feminist revolution” need not do away with gender and doing so would result in (at least some) good being unnecessarily lost. Many insist that the ways in which people are treated as woman and men is the problem feminists should focus on—being a woman or a man is not primarily the problem. And many claim to find their gender a source of positive value. After all, it is certainly true that, although one may be discriminated against due to one’s gender, it can still be something one values positively; in a similar sense, one can take pride in one’s racial group membership despite being socially disadvantaged by it. The everyday conception of gender clashes with feminist conceptions like Haslanger’s. As a result, ordinary thinking doubts the viability of eradicating gender because it sees gender as being at least partly a positive social identity rather than being a wholly negative one.\n\nProjects like Haslanger’s do, of course, start by aiming to alter the ways in which we are viewed and treated as women and men. So, in a sense, the abolitionist and re-evaluative routes go hand-in-hand to begin with. But the abolitionist strategy runs into difficulties if many social agents are unwilling to follow it through. Haslanger is asking for a significant shift in people’s self-conceptions and acknowledges that she is asking social agents to understand themselves in ways that are not ordinarily part of their gendered self-understandings (“Gender and Race” 48). In so doing, she is “call[ing] upon us to reject what seemed to be positive social identities” and to refuse to be gendered women and men (“Gender and Race” 48). I agree with Haslanger that a change in our self-understandings is called for; but I wonder if the change that she is calling for is the right kind of change given that ordinary thinking does not see the viability of eradicating gender. Again, my point is strategic: accounts that have abolitionist implications are likely to be extremely demanding. It will take a lot of convincing to make ordinary social agents view their gender as not being even in part a positive social identity and to make them refuse to be gendered women and men, if social agents do not believe to begin with that this is necessary. And, one might wonder, whether scarce feminist resources should be directed at something other than trying to convince social agents to revise their self-understandings in this manner.\n\nFortunately my students always do express a desire to see an end to gendered oppression. And clearly this is what Haslanger also wants, which may suggest that really the parties to the debate are just talking past each other. Everyone wants the same thing: gender justice. Haslanger’s rhetoric just differs from how we ordinarily talk about women and men. Usually, acknowledging this does not dispel my students’ worries; they still find it puzzling that Haslanger doesn’t use gender terms as people ordinarily do and wonder why she is confusing matters with her conception of gender. Of course, Haslanger’s rhetoric has a specific, valuable purpose: to motivate a certain kind of social and political response that undermines sexist oppression. But, given the kinds of worries I have mentioned here, strategically I think that this kind of response can be better motivated by understanding the phenomena feminists discuss under the rubric of sex and gender in a way that does not imply women and men no longer exist “after the revolution”. The worry is that accounts with abolitionist implications probably would not motivate positive social change, if this change requires that social agents must give up something they do not want to give up.\n\n**The Trait/Norm Covariance Model**\n\nThis section develops my trait/norm covariance model as an alternative to the sex/gender distinction. To begin with, it is important to note that, contrary to traditional feminist views, I do not take the term “woman” to be a purely social gender term. Ordinary speakers have, to use Ron Mallon’s terminology, indicative features in mind when they call someone a “woman”:\n\n>there is a distinction between those properties that are indicative of category membership (such as easily perceptible racial [or gender] markers), and those that are central. A property is indicative of category membership if having the property increases the likelihood that one is a member of a category. In the United States wearing a dress is indicative of being a woman ... [But w]earing a dress is neither necessary nor sufficient for being a woman.\n\n(652–3)\n\nIndicative features of womanhood include one’s appearance (clothing, hairstyles, make-up); behavioural patterns; social roles; and anatomical and bodily features (body type, shape, size, amount of body hair and how one “carries” one’s body). These features are conceivably involved in everyday gender ascriptions. Paradigmatically, feminists hold that the indicative features mentioned are not exclusively gender traits in that they include features which are taken to be paradigmatic sex traits (to do with being female or male). But, ordinary language users often deploy “woman” on the basis of anatomical sex features such as body type; “woman” is not a purely gender term for them, but (bluntly put) a mixture of sex and gender. So, ordinarily “woman” denotes individuals who are taken to possess features indicative of womanhood. This does not (and certainly should not) limit the application of “woman” to women-born-female; the term also applies to trans women, individuals “assigned male at birth whose gender presentation may be construed as ‘unambiguously’ female” (Bettcher 46), who call themselves “women”.\n\nMy contention is that feminists should use the term “woman” as ordinarily as possible. And the trait/norm covariance model that I will outline next will be sensitive to these reflections about ordinary language use. The model I am proposing deals roughly with the same phenomena that the sex/gender distinction does. It just understands that phenomena in a different way that is, I submit, more fruitful in being more congenial to everyday thinking. On my view, we redraw the boundaries of the sets of gender traits and sex traits giving up the labels “sex” and “gender” to denote those traits. Instead, the traits are divided into sets of descriptive traits and evaluative norms. The former (in a sense) describe “the way the world is” and include physical and anatomical traits (e.g., chromosomes, ovaries, testes, genitalia, body shape and size), one’s appearance (e.g., one’s clothing, make-up, haircut, amount of body hair), roles (e.g., whether one undertakes caretaking roles, engages in childrearing tasks) and self-conceptions (calling oneself a woman or a man). These are features of which there are “facts of the matter”—it isn’t in any sense mysterious or down to value judgements whether one has ovaries, undertakes childrearing tasks, or calls oneself a woman. (This does not mean that values were not involved in singling out descriptive features, like anatomical traits, or that descriptive features are not socially malleable; but more on this shortly.) Evaluative norms are to do with stereotypical judgements: whether one is judged to be, to appear to be and/or to act in ”feminine”, ”masculine” or “neutral” ways. Evaluative norms attributed reflect value judgements and cultural norms. So, on my and the paradigmatic feminist schemas:\n\n Paradigmatic feministmodel|.. |Trait/normcovariancemodel | ..\n--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------\nSex\t               |Gender                 |Descriptive traits\t   |Evaluative norms\nHaving ovaries\t|Wearing make-up |Having ovaries\t           |Being “feminine”\n\t                |Being “feminine”   |Wearing make-up\t|\n\nWhat does it mean to say that evaluative norms covary with descriptive traits? Just that we take certain traits to be of certain kind. So, the trait/norm covariance relation is constituted by particular descriptive traits being viewed in a particular manner by us. I take “femininity” to mean “associated with women”, “masculinity” to mean “associated with men” and “neutrality” to mean “associated with neither or both”. That is, depending on how we view particular descriptive traits, they either covary with femininity, masculinity or neutrality. And certain trait/norm pairings are currently linked to women, others to men and still others to neither or both. They can be so linked in a global or (more often than not) in a local manner. For instance, being short-sighted is globally neutral: as far as I know, the trait is nowhere associated exclusively with either women or men thereby globally covarying with neutrality. Then again, possession of testes appears to be globally masculine, possession of ovaries globally feminine. Quite often, though, the trait/norm pairings are local differing from one context to the next and depending on social and cultural factors. So, although all cultures have traits that covary with femininity and others that covary with masculinity, the configurations of these trait/norm pairings can differ depending on their location. To illustrate, take long hair. In many UK communities it is no longer strongly associated with women and often covaries with neutrality. However, in UK Asian-Indian communities that do not consider it appropriate for those picked out by “woman” to have short hair, having long hair covaries more strongly with femininity. But, of course, other social and cultural axes affect this covariance relation even within a culture: in many UK Indian Sikh contexts, neither men nor women are expected to cut their hair, which suggests that (in these social contexts) having long hair covaries with neutrality. However, in these contexts, other practices to do with hair covary with femininity and masculinity, like the practice of Sikh men wearing turbans. The trait/norm pairings are interrelated: with those picked out by “man”, the pairing “having long hair/neutrality” is interrelated with “wearing a turban/masculinity”; but for those picked out by “woman” the former pairing is not interrelated with the latter pairing. (For more on Asian social conventions to do with hair, see Hiltebeitel and Miller.) The trait/norm covariance relations can also change over time. Wearing trousers is a good example: until quite recently in many Western Anglo-European contexts, masculinity covaried with it. But, relatively quickly, in many contexts it has become neutral. It is now socially acceptable for someone ordinarily picked out by “woman” to wear trousers. The same social value is no longer attached to this trait. Of course, this all further demonstrates that the ways in which the trait/norm covariance relations pan out are not always straightforward. Since the relations depend on beliefs and conventions that change over time and place, they will usually be manifestations of some local and contextspecific beliefs and conventions. There are many complications not least because of differences in contexts and in what norms social agents project on descriptive traits. Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that sometimes seeing how the relations pan out is not complicated and that sometimes social agents do not differ significantly in their ascriptions of norms.\n\nI have said that certain descriptive traits covary with certain evaluative norms, but what explains this covariance relation? I take the existence of this relation to be a thoroughly mind-dependent matter. If you like, wearing make-up and engaging in child-care (to name two descriptive traits) are not inherently or mind-independently feminine–that femininity covaries with them is something that depends for its existence on social factors and obtains because of us. The classification scheme of feminine, masculine and neutral evaluative norms is a strong pragmatic construction; that is, social factors wholly determine our use of the scheme and the scheme fails to represent accurately any “facts of the matter” (Haslanger, “Ontology and Social Construction” 100). So, the classification scheme does not pick out any mind-independent facts about descriptive traits. That some traits are viewed as feminine, masculine or neutral is a consequence of “human-made” fashions, styles, cultural beliefs, social conventions and linguistic practices, which determine what features are judged to be of what kind. The classification scheme of feminine/masculine/neutral is a mere social construction. Furthermore, this scheme tends to be hierarchal in grading traits; this is evident from the devaluing of many activities and features with which femininity covaries (like the devaluing of caretaking work).\n\nOn my model the claim “Jane is feminine because Jane wears make-up” does not capture any mind-independent fact about the world. Yet, my model also takes wearing make-up to be a descriptive trait of which there is “a fact of the matter”. So, it appears that saying Jane wears make-up does capture something mind-independent about the world. It is worth clarifying the notion of mind-independence here to avoid an air of inconsistency. Consider driving. In the United Kingdom, people drive on the left-hand side of the road; in the United States, they drive on the right. Which convention is the correct or true one? We cannot say because the context-specific conventions that govern driving are mind-dependent: they depend for their existence on productive human social practices and require that certain human-made background conditions are in place. Such conventions are, of course, mutable. The UK government could just decide to alter conventions governing driving. Obviously doing so in practice would be hugely difficult and certainly no easy feat. But the point is that ultimately conventions come down to us—there is no mind-independent fact about which side of the road is the correct side for driving. However, that people drive on the left in the United Kingdom is mind-independent in another sense. When I state “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” I am stating something that is true mind-independently: the truth of the statement is not (if you like) up for grabs. I cannot just decide that the statement is false and drive on the right. (Or, I could, but probably with quite tragic results.) So, given certain background conditions, it is a mind-independent fact that in the United Kingdom people drive on the left irrespective of the fact that the convention to drive on the left is minddependent.\n\nThe descriptive trait of wearing make-up is akin to the convention of driving on the left: it is mind-dependent in that it is a trait that depends for its existence on particular human-made social conditions (it requires that certain human-made background conditions are in place). The trait is also socially mutable: wearing make-up might, for example, go out of fashion thus prompting people to abandon the practice. Nonetheless, that Jane wears make-up is (in another sense) mind-independent. The truth or falsity of the statement “Jane wears make-up” is not up for grabs: either she does or she doesn’t. This is akin to the claim “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left”: however mind-dependent—due to productive human activities— the respective conventions (to drive on the left and to wear make-up) are, whether the statements “Jane wears make-up” and “People in the United Kingdom drive on the left” are true or false is not open to debate given our current conventions. By contrast, the claim “The convention to drive on the left is better than the convention to drive on the right” is utterly mind-dependent. Whether this statement is thought to be true or false depends on one’s view or opinion, in addition to the convention to drive on the left being a product of human social practices. \n\nNow, although it is a mind-independent feature of reality that Jane wears makeup, that Jane acts in a feminine way because she wears make-up is mind-dependent. It does not capture any mind-independent facts about the world, like some supposed fact that the practice of wearing make-up is inherently feminine. That femininity covaries with wearing make-up is mind-dependent obtaining due to productive human activities—because of us. This further illustrates that the trait/norm covariance relation is not a causal relation in the sense that the former causes the latter.\n\nChildcare activities or the practice of wearing make-up do not cause femininity to covary with them; rather, our beliefs and judgements cause this. To illustrate, think about morality. Standardly moral philosophers agree that the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness. But does the act cause moral goodness? This depends on one’s metaethical commitments. For some moral realists, the answer might be yes: the act of giving to charity instantiates a realist (non-natural) moral property of goodness. So, the act of giving to charity literally causes moral goodness to pop up in the world because one’s actions instantiate the property of goodness. For moral constructivists, however, the answer might be no: the act of giving to charity covaries with moral goodness because we project moral goodness onto the act of giving to charity. Roughly, we have constructed a moral world in which giving to charity is considered good. So, the relation between giving to charity and moral goodness is not a causal one in that the former causes the latter. That giving to charity is considered to be morally good is down to us. The same appears to be true of what I have said about descriptive traits and evaluative norms: we have constructed a gendered world in which childcare and wearing make-up are considered to be feminine. That is, we— human social agents—are responsible for these covariance relations. And this being fortunately the case, we can also alter them so that childcare, for instance, no longer covaries with femininity.\n\n[continued below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/6yp60e/ontological_commitments_sex_and_gender_by_mari/dmp1uid/)",

    "text": "Quitting your job. What's the best quit your job stories? I was there four long years, but I wish it would have been 4 hours. At first it wasn't that bad in my eyes because it was my first entry level job and I was making more money than I had my entire life. But after a few months and I was let loose so to speak, things got toxic as hell. First off, I had three bosses. All three were snarky, entilted,full of themselves, disrepsectful, perverted, vulgar, etc. I could go on and on. I started as a 22 year old male, and even I would literally cringe at the things they would say about women, politicians, other co-workers, or just anybody they felt deserved their ridicule. One manager in particular, who was my main boss, was the most repulsive. He made the other two look like angels dipped in pixie dust. He was short, fat, dipped snuff and typically had it all over his face, extremely loud, bullish, etc. Again, I could write a book on how awful this guy is/was. He would patronize the receptionist on a daily basis. And belittle anything and anybody. Any woman, and I mean any age or color, that walked in the door he couldn't help but judge her attractiveness in the most asinine way. Needless to say, I pretty much heard a grown tell me how he would fuck said woman every day of the week. He would plop his fat belly on top of his desk and imitate sex moves. It was disgusting and me and my co-workers had to sit through this and smile like we approved of what he was doing. It was awful. Not only did he do lewd acts like the mentioned, but he may have been the most judgemental/hypocritical human being I have ever been around. He would criticize people for not raising their kids right even though he didn't have any. He would make people feel like complete shit for taking their company issued vacations but he would miss four days in a row with no explaination. He mocked and made fun of an employee when he was going through a divorce, yet his wife had been wanting to leave him for months. He called another co worker worthless and a loser because he was struggling with an alcohol addiction, but he was a recovering alcoholic. He just flat out sucked to be around. Needless to say, he was a big part of the job being a toxic environment for everyone. But besides all that, they were extremely unfair with our work. We were in sales, and we had a damn good sales teams. We were breaking monthly and yearly sales records left and right. But none of that was good enough. We had weekly and in some cases daily meetings where we were threatened with our jobs if we didn't do this or do that. And anytime someone stood up for everybody, they would start their belittling train of garbage and try and make us feel 3 foot tall. We struggled to meet their impossible and unfair goals. At only 25, I had to check myself into the ER one night because of stress related palpitations. My BP was high and I was just burnt out. I tried my damnest to get out. I had a couple of interviews mixed in but nothing came about. I was ready to take a job shoveling poop just to get out of that God forsaken place. Well, one day...... shit hit the fan. I was working a customer and got him to commit, I went to my main bosses office to tell him what was going on. Well, he proceeded to tell me that he didn't like the way I handled the deal and I was awful at my job. (Keep in mind I have the deal SOLD) I slightly showed anger and told him I didn't appreciate him talking to me like that and that I've done nothing but work my ass off for him. He stands up and starts screaming in my face. Calls me a lazy piece of shit, a \"lazy millennial\", and that I should just go live off my dad's money (my dad is not rich). Welp, I shoved him. Shoved him as hard as I could against the wall and we go to tussling all over the place. Co workers break us up and as we are standing face to face I call him every name I've ever wanted to call him. It was the most relieving yet upsetting thing I have ever done. Of course, he says I'm fired. And I tell him great, I don't want to work for a fat, tea pot shaped fuck anyway (LOL). I go home that night and call everybody from the General Manager to the CEO and pour my soul into telling them what was going on at that store between me and everyone who works there. See, all they see is numbers, they had no idea what was going on inside. Well, the GM calls the next couple of days and is sucking up like crazy. Not only does he offer me to stay, he offers an extra week of vacation and he is willing to pay for it up front. They knew how pissed I was and I had ammo to turn their shit show into a PR nightmare. I accepted the offer and took the money and quit the day after. Best day of my life.",

    "text": "The long con to joining your dream company (what worked for me) [(original here)](https://medium.com/@jennlau/the-long-con-to-joining-your-dream-company-64708f10b020)\n\nMy only credibility in writing this is that I am now working for a company that I really, really wanted to work for. It’s almost been a year!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI hope this works for you too.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you already have an idea of where or for whom you want to work for, sweet! That makes things easier.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDespite having one particular company (ok, I’m just going to start calling it Company A for brevity’s sake) that I had set my sights on, I made a list of five-ish companies that I would target. I wanted to chat with each of them — not necessarily get an interview, but really learn about the company and see if we jibe.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re contemplating a switch, these questions might help you get started:\nWhat do you spend your free time doing and thinking about? What gets you psyched? Healthcare & public health.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWould you prefer a 9–5 job, or a start-uppy type job? Start-uppy!\nWhat are examples of some companies that are in that market? Make a list of those in your vicinity, or wherever you’re willing to move to.\nWith your current experience, what could you do in that type of company? I wanted to work in tech, with zero programming skills. Marketing or sales for me!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDo you know anyone that works in the aforementioned companies? Yes!\nIf you answered ‘no’ to that last question, stop reading, because it is all about who you know.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nKidding. Don’t stop reading. I do truly think it is at least partially about who you know, though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn this case, I was in luck because I had an friend that worked at Company A. Actually, she’s how I came to know about them.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI asked my friend if I could name-drop her in an email I sent to the VP of Marketing, as a means of mentioning how I came across Company A. She said cool, go for it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI now work at Company A.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt this point, you’re probably going, “What the hell, you knew someone that worked there! That’s how you got in!”\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOk fine, and it also took an additional 47 email exchanges and several phone calls amongst different departments.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAlso, remember the other companies on my top five-ish list? I had coffee or interviews with all of them, without submitting a single application.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe only thing stopping you from getting to know the right people is the wrong mindset (and maybe a fear of rejection).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*If you don’t know someone, get to know someone.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHere is the process I used for each company, from initial company research, to reach-out:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis was huge for me: get some type of email plug-in that notifies you when people read your emails. If you’re not getting a response but they keep opening your email, they’re likely interested, but very busy. Keep following up. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**1. Research**\nUse common sense, poke around on their website, do some Google searching. If there are job postings on their site, great. Don’t apply directly to the careers page yet — they are likely to get lost in the mix.\nGo on LinkedIn and search for two groups of people: the hiring manager/HR for the office in your area, and someone that might be your direct supervisor (eg. VP of Marketing, VP of Sales). If it’s a small company, I go directly to the CEO. Get their names.\nYou can do the same with someone that used to work at your dream company. Why’d they leave?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**2. Acquire email address**\nWho are you gonna email, and to what address?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you found the right email in Step 1., lucky you. If not, visit their Contact Us page, and you might find something like “info@companyB.com” for Company B. It shouldn’t be too hard.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nStart guessing emails for the person you wanna email.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet’s say I want to email Bart Simpson, who is the VP of Marketing at Company B. There are only so many options: bsimpson@companyb.com, bart.simpson@companyb.com, bart@companyb.com. You’re smart. You got this!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can also try http://mailtester.com/ and see if it is a verified email (this doesn’t always work, the domains are sometimes blocked).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**3. Fire off some emails**\nCraft a compelling subject line and body content. This is friggin’ important!\nKnow who you are emailing. If they have some form of social media, you can get a sense of their humour, hobbies, and values that they hold dear. Be authentic. If you’ve never been to a basketball game, don’t pretend to be a fan. What are some ways you can relate and gain common ground?\nYou can see some examples here.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRemember how I cautioned to hold off on applying directly on the careers page? If you’re speaking to the right person, they might be kind enough to get your application in the right hands.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMost importantly, it is not just about getting a job — hence the long con. Regardless of how much of a good hiring decision you might be, not every organization can hire you at the snap of a finger. It’s about talking to experts in your industry. An hour of fruitful conversation can trump reading several hours of reading. What you learn from one person may strike enough of a chord with another person to consider you a valuable asset (I hate those words too).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn this process, I learned a couple things:\n\n* People want to help you if they can sense your authenticity in wanting to learn. Not everyone is free for coffee; most people are free for a phone call.\n* Relentlessly follow up.\n* Sow your seeds! Where there may not be opportunity now, there may be opportunity later.",

    "text": "Confused about bonus that came in way below expectations? Hey all,\n\nFirst up, throwaway account.\n\nI'll keep this short and to the point.\n\nI work within a non-sales field within the business, but am very close to revenue. My performance within my actual role is fantastic, but I'm always looking for ways to add value to the business, often on my own time.\n\nIn this particular instance, I went after a specific sales partnership and landed the client. The contract came in and is worth mid $xxx,xxx. I've mainly worked on this deal in my own time (outside of hours) and balanced it with the work I was assigned to. \n\nThe deal was celebrated in front of the entire team this past week. I was praised, told this is a one of a kind deal that is fantastic for the business, and sets the standard for what we aim to do moving forward - plus a thank-you for working outside of hours. It's also a sizeable amount of money, as stated above, and has a few accounting incentives that make it even better P&L side. \n\n*Here's the problem:*\n\nI was handed an envelope, expecting a bonus. The \"bonus\" was a couple of gift vouchers worth a couple hundred dollars. I was honestly embarrassed, felt physically sick for the amount of work I put into this and felt very undervalued as a result. \n\nI was expecting a decent bonus, as a comparison, my bonus was ~$7k mid-year. \n\n*How I knew to expect a bonus:*\n\nI think it's important to clarify this, in case my expectations aren't in-line. \n\n- After a call with the client, I asked my boss for some time off. I'd previously used all my leave, and had none left. I asked my boss, and he basically said, \"you're about to land a deal worth x and you're asking for some unpaid time off? I think we can do a little more that, plus a bonus.\"\n\n- I was out with my boss for lunch discussing where the action items for the deal were at. He referenced to not having forgotten my bonus, he just hadn't had time to come up with something yet.. that was a couple of days before the team announcement.\n\n*Couple of other things in the mix:*\n\n- I didn't ask for a raise at my annual review - that was a few weeks ago. The business hasn't been doing that well, so I wanted to wait for a few things to come in before raising the question and putting them in an uncomfortable spot. I'm directly tied to revenue and have taken on far more work than before, so believe I deserve one now. It's possible that I haven't been forward enough about wanting more money. I worked my ass off for the mid-year bonus, but it definitely came as a surprise and was fairly hush hush. \n\n- I'm pushing for a role of being directly responsible for revenue. I've spoken to three key decision makers about this including the CEO, and they're all positive. I'm not sure if I should bite my tongue and wait this out as I don't want to hurt the chances of this, or if I have something to legitimately bring up, without causing issues. Worth saying, I have a good relationship with all contacts.\n\nAnyway, my main question is, should I ask what's up with the \"bonus\" they gave me? I feel insulted, and considering they've extended the line to bring me closer to sales, I'm not sure if I just gave them a freebie or if bigger things are in the mix and I should just wait it out. \n\nThanks!",

    "text": "New Job 3 months in....Help (Long Read) WARNING Long Read:\n\nTLDR: Company blindsided me into a position, no processes in place, no proper management in place and seems to be misappropriating funds and giving me very different work and I am only 3 months in.\n\nI had left my old employer of 5 years, where there was no more development for my career and the commute was 3 hours a day after an office relocation to join a small startup (or no longer a start up I was led to believe) closer to home, in fact literally a 20 min walk away. \n\nI didn't apply for a job, I submitted my CV as I was a project manager in the tech world and the company was in the industry. They emailed me to say thanks for the CV but wasn't looking for anyone at the moment. Fast forward 4 months later, they called out the blue and asked if I could meet, and said they had they had a role for me. I was excited went to meet the COO very informally and hit it off, he liked my experience and told me some of the problems etc that I could solve and I left feeling excited. \n\nI get an email saying they wanted to hire me as PM but with responsibilities of managing a team as well. I had managed teams before and they mostly had the skills I was used to and could still technically hold my own. I took the opportunity to develop my skills managing a team and gaining experience with some of their projects that were different that what I had managed before giving me some further experience, it was extra close to home, was given the okay by a few people who had worked with them before, the salary was lower but what I spent on commuting was saved and I negotiated extra after 6 months which would bring me to the same salary as my previous job. \n\nUpon accepting the role I had a 3 month notice at my previous role, I had worked extremely hard for them over the years and was a pretty good employee and very flexible, so asked if they could bring me down to just 2 months, i had a few projects to finish off in this time anyway. They say yes and 3 weeks before starting my new job, the CEO emails me to ask me to come in for a day to get a handover from the previous guy (I wasn't aware there was a previous guy and I was replacing him) and to get up to speed on some of the projects. \n\nI take a day leave in my current role and come along to a Risk meeting for one of their projects. At this point I am guessing this is one of the projects I will be leading on and alarm bells start going off. The project is 2 years in, is not complete, has huge amounts of risk, no paperwork, no logs, no diary and they have been paid 50% upfront and have spent at least 70% of the total cost agreed to be paid, that isn't in writing as they have no contract. I also must say the client is a charitable organisation and very well known in the community and across the country, so a big risk low reward project. \n\nI talk in the meeting and am very frank that this is a project that I would no longer commit too, advise them to call the client and be upfront, give them their money back and move on. But they don't want to, they have a reputation, they are a small firm so they get a PM Company to step in to help them. The PM sent seems very focused, very direct and I can see how she could get the project back on track and had the resource to do so. They tell me not to worry they don't expect me to manage this as the outsourced PM Consultancy company is and that this would be brought back on track for when I arrive. \n\nOkay I thought, if they have an outsourced PM then happy for them to run this and I can run some of the other projects. \n\nI must add at this point, there is no plan, there isn't even anyone taking any minutes in this meeting other than myself. So i send my minutes over at the end of the day after meeting them, tell them I hope all goes okay and I will see you in 2 months as there is absolutely nothing I can do at this moment in time. \n\nThat got me a bit worried, it's a project that also requires different levels of experience with technology I haven't worked with before, but okay they have experts and I can be brought up to speed and hey this isn't gonna be touched by me yet, so PM Consultants can run with it.\n\nI get another email 2 weeks before my official start date asking if I can come in again for an overview of another project and for me to work on a presentation I am going to be giving at an event about 3 hours from where I live on my second day of employment, and write a letter of response to an email received from a member of parliament about a project I will be leading on...when I start working for them. \n\nSo I take another day and go and visit the offices, work with the team on the project and get up to speed, I make a pretty basic presentation with the time I have and am pretty clear with the info they have given me, one of the lead tech engineers on the project is coming with me too and so it isn't feeling terribly difficult, but I like to talk about things I know. I am comfortable giving presentations of course and talking in front of hundreds of people but when I know what I am talking about. \n\nAnyway at this time I realise I should start work for them earlier because I want to spend a bit of time on the presentation and gathering notes and writing this letter, so I agree to start a day early (I had leave from my old employer that I was taking as a destresser before I started and I had holiday booked with the SO) my previous role was also very stressful.\n\nIt's on this day that I travel to this presentation with the senior engineer who proceeds to fill me in about the company. Bear in mind I asked around locally around this company I had friends and colleagues from another employer who had advised this was an okay company and I did what research I could on employer rating sites and couldn't see anything negative. \n\nI get home this night and literally cannot believe what I have heard. From activities of fraud to extremely bad hires to people hired who were family members to take company money and misappropriate funds. To the CEO taking asking their Finance Officer to pick up shoes and drive them to a date, while requesting they wait in the car and work. My brain is going haywire, I cannot believe what I have heard. But I take it to stock and hope that this might be a disgruntled employee and I will keep my eye on him. \n\nAfter this day I start getting up to speed on the two projects they want me to run and manage the team's resource on a day to day. And lo and behold the project that we knew was a shitstorm that should have been farther from 2 months ago, absolutely zero has happened. I cannot get hold of the PM Consultant, I have no paperwork, no documentation, no plans, no action plans absolute zilch. So i go to my CEO who was involved in this project and he just refers me to PM Consultant over and over again. At this point I am getting nowhere fast so I dig in to it and try to pick it apart and do the things that should have been done. At this moment right now I have managed to reengage with the client and got on a good footing and am progressing nicely, but we are still spending money I don't have and its a headache. \n\nThe other project is okay, it's stable however work that should have been done 6 months ago is now only getting done because I am here. The project is monitored by a governing body but I manage the project for my company and three other partnering companies. It's a challenging one but it's fruitful has a budget and thankfully has all the docs and paperwork up to speed (except I should mention that all though there was paperwork, half of it had people on it who was either a) made up to obtain extra budget b) no longer worked for the company and they either forgot to remove or no doubt left to retain their resource costs. \n\nI work on the project for a month and all is well.\n\nI have to submit my quarterly report to the PM and have gotten it back on track and I now submit my financials which consists of 4 mileage Travel days for me and the team, 4 lunch receipts, resource costs and one hotel. My Finance officer sends me his over and it's astronomical, 5K for travel and other. It has hotels, restaurant receipts for over £200, bike scheme for the boss it's insane. So this was not expected budget out of my project and it's pretty obvious some of what is here is not for the project. \n\nThe team in the office is a mixed back, half of the team are experienced but heavily resourced and half are pure interns/apprentices who have skills but have absolutely no motivation and literally have no experience in delivering work for projects and they are heavily utilised on my projects, the only projects they work for. On top of this I have been given 3 other projects to work on and I am telling them I can't because my time is heavily resourced. The team hate the CEO, every single person none of them like him and none of them have any good stories to tell. The CEO pulls me in the other day to tell me that they want the two projects I am working on to get to saleable stage and that they are going to give me targets to work on to bring income on these projects, so basically sales. I tell him we can talk about it but this was not what I was brought in to do, but he keeps booking meetings in for me and other companies to try and sell this product. \n\nI am at a loss of what to do, my 3 month probation has now passed although there has been no acknowledgement of such so my 8 weeks notice now kicks in. \n\nI guess I am posting here to see if I was simply just blindsided into this role, the company like me and want me to move up to COO position which my COO seems to be giving me a lot of his responsibilities anyway but the CEO is not a nice person. When he is in the office all hell breaks loose, he interrupts heavy resource, he seems to determine people to do work which isn't in their remit to do and decides workload which I have to back track and try and reshift. I have another manager who is above myself and on the level of COO who is so demeaning when requesting resource, not telling me what resource is for, not giving me requirements and there is literally no proper PM process in here which I have also been trying to implement as a whole. And the projects that he is demanding resource on has no PM and no process, requirements or documentation.  There is one other PM in the company who is okay but is on the same salary as me I found out and manages two projects, and asked me how I monitor my actions?\n\nAfter writing this I know I should leave and I am going to start looking for jobs, but I have only been here 3 months. What would you guys do in this position? Am I being dramatic? How is this 3 months going to look like? Is this company insane? It really makes me want to start my own up.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "text": "Got a strane email from an older male student but given the context I'm not sure if it's a red flag or not... Backstory for context:\nI am a University student getting my degree and certification in TESOL – Teaching English to speakers of other languages.  I volunteer three-four times a week, two hours each time in a local community college’s ESL classroom.  Each quarter we get old students graduating out of our class (it’s beginning elementary English) and get new students signing up for class.  I speak Spanish and Chinese, as well as English.\n\n\nI always take a special shine (even though I’m not supposed to) to specific students, and certain students really take a shine to me over some of the other classroom assistants.  I like to learn a lot about my students, and usually make an effort to get to class early and stay a little late to get to talk to the students outside of class.  \n\n\nBeginning of my problem:\nLast quarter I had a student, let’s call him Jeng.  He is a late-middle-aged Chinese immigrant, and his wife who I’ll call Xue is also in the class.  He was in our beginning level class, but he’s quite obviously NOT a beginning level English speaker.  He’s damn near fluent, but he just has trouble writing, so needed a quarter in a low level class to catch his writing up with his speaking.  Jeng was always so jovial.  He was very chatty with us, the teachers and the other students.  He always had the most to say, and sometimes could go off on random but entertaining conversation tangents.\n\n\nJeng was VERY complimentary.  To everyone, but I felt like he ‘picked’ on me a lot.  (I say picked but it wasn’t a bad thing, though it was sometimes awkward).  He started out just saying the usual, that I was smart, that I was a good teacher, that I was very helpful.  Then he found out that I speak Chinese, and he would compliment me on my accent, my pronunciation, my vocabulary choice if he ever heard me speaking it.  I’m not a very verbose Chinese speaker though, my vocab is pretty limited, so he would always offer to give me Chinese lessons after class.  \n\n\nThen the compliments got…strange.  He would compliment me on my ‘fair’ skin.  He found out I’m mixed race and then kept telling me I was beautiful and fair for my race (I am very light skinned for my mix but….it’s just a weird compliment to receive, it’s not something I usually take as a compliment but I knew he was just trying to be nice.)  Then he asked me about my ‘white’ side, and I said my ‘white’ side is Dutch, because I tell everyone this, it’s not a secret and I’m not bashful about it.  Then, the next class, he told me ‘You have a very regal air about you, like you could be a fair Dutch queen.’  \n\n\nHonestly I felt like this compliment was way over the top, but what was I supposed to do?  I just tried to deflect in my usual self deprecating way, but he kept insisting for days that I looked like a European queen, or European Princess, or ‘Aristocrat.’  But the thing is, his wife was with him every time he would compliment me, and she would smile and nod, though she wasn’t big on talking (her speaking level was lower than his.)  So, I always got the feeling that these kinds of compliments were somewhat normal to them, and not anything weird.  So I let it go, and chalked it up to a clash of cultures, which happens A LOT in ESL classrooms.  \n\n\nMy current problem:\nI always give out an email address to my students so that they can email me when I’m not in class for homework help, since I assign a lot of them specific homeworks.  But today I got an email from Jeng, who isn’t even in my classroom this quarter, and said he and his wife ‘really like me’.  He wrote ‘My son is coming from China and I think it is good that you meet him!  Then, maybe I can give you Chinese lessons!’ \n\n\nAm I overthinking this?  Is this weird?  Or is this just a little bit overzealously friendly?  I’ve never been to China myself, and so I don’t know if this is a common sort of practice?  My friend joked that maybe he’s trying to set his son up with an American girl but I don’t think that’s the case, I’m pretty sure Jeng told me once his son had a wife or girlfriend or something.  The thing is, if this were a white guy in his early 50s?  I’d probably report him to someone.  But it’s this sweet friendly old Chinese man and his wife, so I feel like there might be a cultural disconnect happening here.\n\n\nI just need someone to tell me ‘no you’re not crazy for feeling weird’ or ‘oh you’re crazy this is a totally normal type of interaction in the context of Northern Chinese culture’ I guess.  What do you ladies think?  I feel like my ‘lady defense’ shield is always up but maybe it shouldn’t be?",

    "text": "Should I continue to sleep with my friend? [Disclaimer: As of right now, I am 18 soon to be 19. If you read this post, you'll quickly figure out that I am quite young. I was slightly conflicted between posting this on here or r/Teenagers, but I remembered 13 year olds are over there. I understand that this is an adult issue, so I would like some adult perspective. I guess I am explicitly stating this because I don't want to be talked down to. I know sex comes with this clusterfuck of feelings and issues and conflicts, so on and so forth. I always use condoms, get tested regularly for STDs and I have Mirena inserted. I love having sex, but I want to hold on to the pretense of having a \"future\". I promise you that my Christian mother who had me at 22 has talked to me enough.]\n\nQuick background/rant, sorry:\n\nWe have been really close friends since 11th grade and by our senior year of high school, we had both been in relationships for over a year. But, after some talking, sexting, etc, for a few months, we decided to have sex. I think it was supposed to be a one time thing, but we have been seeing each other off and on since January of this year. I broke up with my boyfriend the day after the first time, but he has still been with his girlfriend. I think I kept seeing him the earlier half of this year because it made me feel less alone. Plus, it has different with him so far.. like sex is unbelievably good.\n\nThe last time I came home (Thanksgiving) he told me that his girlfriend wanted to sleep with someone else of a specific race, so they made an agreement that he could have sex with someone else as well. (If you think this is weird, trust me, so do I.) Since, we have already been seeing each other, he asked me if I wanted to, and of course I said yes. (MORE Background: I go to a university with 50,000+ students. I know I might find someone decent eventually.. but the guys I have been with so far suck in terms of sex.)\n\nMy senior year I felt really bad sleeping with him (+ guilty for cheating). Looking back now I think I was really jealous of his girlfriend and confused with why he was sabotaging his relationship. I know my self-esteem is wrapped up in this still; I am trying to figure out how. For one, I have never wanted to date him (obviously, he cheats, among other reasons). I have always felt jealous seeing them together at school, pictures of her on the internet, etc. Despite just getting out of a relationship, not wanting another one because I knew I was going off to college, maybe... I subconsciously wanted to be with someone?\n\nNow, I am a freshman in college. I have been back home twice and I saw him both times. I really like seeing him. Despite everything else, he is a really good friend of mine and I always have a fun time with him. I think early December while I was prepping for finals he told me that for sure he didn't want to do this anymore. (He has been extremely on and off this entire year.) I agreed because I have always let him decide. I think ONCE, I have texted him first. I really like seeing him and I know I'm going to have a good time, so why say no? But, whenever he would tell me that he wanted to stop, I respected that. Until November, we had seen each other maybe once a month up until August. We go weeks without talking, then he hits me up. I don't mean to be so easy with him, but it is such a chill situation.\n\nOn the other hand, I get bothered by this notion and the posts that circulate the internet that say something along the lines of \"Guys always cheat on a 10 with a 5\" and \"They do it because the 5 is easy to get\". Shit like this. I hate seeing it, because all I think is about this situation. His girlfriend is fucking gorgeous. I know I shouldn't compare myself to anyone, but it's hard. She is feminine, curvy, has beautiful longish dark, curly hair and pretty skin. I am mainly skinny (as a black girl, this isn't the most ideal shape) and look like a 12 year old boy. I don't like the idea of being that sorry \"5\". \n\nFurthermore, I have mixed feelings about him having a girlfriend. I like it because I feel comfortable knowing that this is merely a friends with benefits situation, but I feel bad for her. So many times I want to DM her and tell her that she is beautiful and (probably) smart and funny and talented and she should not be with this loser. (She is a senior in HS now.) I want to tell her that she deserves so much better and she has her whole life ahead of her and she has no reason to stay with this lame ass dude. She will eventually find someone that isn't so emotionally dependent on other people that they cheat when she needs time to herself. But, that \"loser\" is my friend and I can't do that to him. I know he loves her and is good to her, but still.\n\nNow, him and his girlfriend have decided to take a break after New Year's. For them, that means being \"basically single\". Naturally, he texted me and asked if I would be willing to see him and I said yes. But, now I am conflicted; being in college, I am too busy to care about any repercussions, because I see him, then I leave. HOWEVER, when I do care I feel ugly in terms of my personality and my personal appearance, like I'm that \"sorry 5\". I guess I'm asking should I remove myself from this situation permanently or should I continue see him?\n\nTL;DR - I've been the side chick of a good friend of mine for almost a year now. It kind of makes me feel shit about myself, but he is really good in bed and I enjoy the dynamic of our friendship. (No feelings, time in-between, optional, etc.) I'm in town for a few more weeks, should I see him  or should I stop seeing him for good?",

    "text": "New Cardiology NP - I think my salary was lowballed This is on a throwaway for privacy's sake, but I was just shown a contract for my current cardiology practice to transition from an RN (with them for 4 years thus far) to an NP. I graduated last May and held tight with promises that \"we are going to hire you.\" (FYI my practice was bought by a for-profit entity a year ago).\n\nFinally they threw a contract in front of me today to review. 25 PTO days a year (actually 16 after holidays are removed, and that includes sick leave and CME days), which do not accrue. It's a 3 year contract with a 24 month 10 mile noncompete. There's a bonus structure of cash collections x 50% - salary x 25%, which I figure will be miniscule if anything. \n\nThe salary is 85k a year. Oddly enough in the draft I was given Ninety Nine Thousand is written out next to the numerical figures. I was originally quoted 90k (which I thought was low but acceptable) by the CEO, who has since claimed she doesn't remember saying this. It's a draft copy and they keep verbally stating 85k, so I feel like the 99k written out on the contract was an oversight when they were putting new figures in.\n\nI like this practice and this place but I feel lowballed. I have 4 years of cardiac experience. I live in Missouri. I have wanted this job for months and administration *know* this, but the physicians in my practice have basically been demanding from corporate this job for me for a while. I know they lowball because they just hired a new RN for barely more than what I started out at floor nursing as a new grad, and several dollars an hour below what they started me as when we were owned by the nonprofit.\n\nI asked to have the salary revisited but I don't have a lot of hope they will raise it. If they don't, am I killing my future earnings with this contract? Do you guys see any red flags?\n\nNo call, no holidays. A mix of cardiology acute hospital care, clinic, and SNF consultations.",

    "text": "Need Career Advice - CPA & CFE With 8 Year of Experience Hi all,\n\nI’m looking for some career advice as to what I should do next. I’m a 29-year-old CPA and CFE (Just passed the CFE last week) with 8 years of experience. I was in public accounting for four years doing a mixture of tax and audit for two regional firms (Fuck the big 4). I was a senior accountant and analyst for a healthcare startup for 2 years. Currently, I’m a controller for a small private equity firm that specializes in commercial and residential real estate. It’s a property management company that oversees numerous properties that are held under 40 different taxable entities. Each entity has at least one bank account which means we perform about 75 bank reconciliations a month. Riveting, I know. Basically, I oversee and perform everything accounting and finance related. \n\nI was originally hired by the CFO but he quit in February 2017 to become a CEO for another company. I took over his role and had a coworker promoted to accounting manager. Now it’s me (Controller), an accounting manager, an AP clerk and an AR clerk with some other analysts and admin staff mixed in. \n\nThe CFO acted as a boss, a mentor and a friend. He was constantly teaching and training me. As a result, I learned a great deal of knowledge. However, since he has departed, my learning has flat lined and I’m essentially going through the motions and babysitting the company. I’m afraid that if I stay here much longer, I’ll get technically behind and never make that leap to be a CFO/COO/Executive somewhere else. I don’t know if I should try to get my MBA, CMA or another certification? \n\nThe primary issues are that it’s a family business that is never going to grow, they don’t treat or invest in their employees (everyone is disposable), taking days off is frowned upon and I’m essentially an adult baby sitter. Additionally, I don’t have much say in the decision-making process. I turn 30 in February and kinda freaking out ha ha.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Does anybody here have a sibling who contributes to the Black dating issues? I mean the typical issues like the idea that non Black women/men are better than Black people. My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

Now \"the party has a policy requiring any departing MLA to be replaced by a woman or 'equity-seeking candidate,' including racial minorities, Indigenous people, and members of the LGBTQ community.\"   One poor sap had to claim he was [bisexual](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/ndp-candidate-reveals-bisexuality-after-questions-over-party-s-equity-rule-1.3811299) to prevent losing his job.  \n\nThis is not \"justice\", social or otherwise.  This is just discrimination under a new name.   \n\nIn the UK, poor white males are now recognized as the most [disadvantaged](http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/34667100/poor-white-boys-get-a-worse-start-in-life-says-equality-report) group.  \n\nWhy wouldn't they be?  If you help every poor ethnic group *except* poor white people of course they'll become the most disadvantaged.  And despite feminist claims, men almost always occupy the very bottom rungs of society.   \n\nThe left has lost its way.  Whereas they used to focus on class and *overcoming* racial and sexual distinctions, they now seek to create maximum conflict between the sexes and races while the billionaires run laughing to the bank.   *Divide et impera* is the oldest trick in the book, and modern day leftists have fallen for it hook, line and sinker.",

    "text": "[Discussion] My industry seems to be hiring and promoting women more due to historical injustice. How is this similar and different than affirmative action in colleges? I just wanted to have an open discussion with y'all so let's try and hold back our biases. I should mention I am for 100% equality but do not think you should create inequality to do so, I'll explain.\n\nMy field has predominantly been male and moved female over the last couple of decades. Now it's fairly even, but the leadership is still majority men, like 70%. I feel this is due to history taking a while to run it's course, as you see the new entrants are fairly equal. Except now I hear the CEO of a certain employer is stating they want more women in leadership. It was not an official statement online but something we heard directly. I'm all for women leaders. But I am concerned with men losing out to these opportunities as a result. \n\nI find this argument similar to that of affirmative action for college admissions. I have mixed feelings but there is no doubt that I, a white guy in a small yet affluent town, had a totally better set of opportunities than say a black woman a few towns over who grew up poorer, etc. I feel that children (18 and under) have little ability to change their opportunities, so AA can help give people an equal footing their parents couldn't. It shouldn't be a kids fault they grew up in a worse place than I did. I didn't do anything to be so lucky. \n\nBut when it comes to workplaces, more so the promotions than the hiring, I feel that it's extremely unequal to promote a woman over me simply because they're making up for past injustices. I feel that if you have a college degree like mine and have the same job as I do, we are on an equal playing field. The promotion should be based on merit and work alone. It hasn't happened to me in any way, but I am wary because I'm seeing what looks like signs of gender preference at work. For what it's worth, I work with 70-80% women and am in fact the only male on my 15-person team. I am the minority which is an odd feeling. Not complaining however. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

    "text": "A Socialist Defense of Gender Roles Edit: wow.  I've never seen such quick downvotes.   Remember that this is supposed to be a discussion forum not an ideological purity contest.   Only downvote if you think this post has contributed nothing to the debate.   \n\nEdit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   \n\nUnusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  \n\nMRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "Got a strane email from an older male student but given the context I'm not sure if it's a red flag or not... Backstory for context:\nI am a University student getting my degree and certification in TESOL – Teaching English to speakers of other languages.  I volunteer three-four times a week, two hours each time in a local community college’s ESL classroom.  Each quarter we get old students graduating out of our class (it’s beginning elementary English) and get new students signing up for class.  I speak Spanish and Chinese, as well as English.\n\n\nI always take a special shine (even though I’m not supposed to) to specific students, and certain students really take a shine to me over some of the other classroom assistants.  I like to learn a lot about my students, and usually make an effort to get to class early and stay a little late to get to talk to the students outside of class.  \n\n\nBeginning of my problem:\nLast quarter I had a student, let’s call him Jeng.  He is a late-middle-aged Chinese immigrant, and his wife who I’ll call Xue is also in the class.  He was in our beginning level class, but he’s quite obviously NOT a beginning level English speaker.  He’s damn near fluent, but he just has trouble writing, so needed a quarter in a low level class to catch his writing up with his speaking.  Jeng was always so jovial.  He was very chatty with us, the teachers and the other students.  He always had the most to say, and sometimes could go off on random but entertaining conversation tangents.\n\n\nJeng was VERY complimentary.  To everyone, but I felt like he ‘picked’ on me a lot.  (I say picked but it wasn’t a bad thing, though it was sometimes awkward).  He started out just saying the usual, that I was smart, that I was a good teacher, that I was very helpful.  Then he found out that I speak Chinese, and he would compliment me on my accent, my pronunciation, my vocabulary choice if he ever heard me speaking it.  I’m not a very verbose Chinese speaker though, my vocab is pretty limited, so he would always offer to give me Chinese lessons after class.  \n\n\nThen the compliments got…strange.  He would compliment me on my ‘fair’ skin.  He found out I’m mixed race and then kept telling me I was beautiful and fair for my race (I am very light skinned for my mix but….it’s just a weird compliment to receive, it’s not something I usually take as a compliment but I knew he was just trying to be nice.)  Then he asked me about my ‘white’ side, and I said my ‘white’ side is Dutch, because I tell everyone this, it’s not a secret and I’m not bashful about it.  Then, the next class, he told me ‘You have a very regal air about you, like you could be a fair Dutch queen.’  \n\n\nHonestly I felt like this compliment was way over the top, but what was I supposed to do?  I just tried to deflect in my usual self deprecating way, but he kept insisting for days that I looked like a European queen, or European Princess, or ‘Aristocrat.’  But the thing is, his wife was with him every time he would compliment me, and she would smile and nod, though she wasn’t big on talking (her speaking level was lower than his.)  So, I always got the feeling that these kinds of compliments were somewhat normal to them, and not anything weird.  So I let it go, and chalked it up to a clash of cultures, which happens A LOT in ESL classrooms.  \n\n\nMy current problem:\nI always give out an email address to my students so that they can email me when I’m not in class for homework help, since I assign a lot of them specific homeworks.  But today I got an email from Jeng, who isn’t even in my classroom this quarter, and said he and his wife ‘really like me’.  He wrote ‘My son is coming from China and I think it is good that you meet him!  Then, maybe I can give you Chinese lessons!’ \n\n\nAm I overthinking this?  Is this weird?  Or is this just a little bit overzealously friendly?  I’ve never been to China myself, and so I don’t know if this is a common sort of practice?  My friend joked that maybe he’s trying to set his son up with an American girl but I don’t think that’s the case, I’m pretty sure Jeng told me once his son had a wife or girlfriend or something.  The thing is, if this were a white guy in his early 50s?  I’d probably report him to someone.  But it’s this sweet friendly old Chinese man and his wife, so I feel like there might be a cultural disconnect happening here.\n\n\nI just need someone to tell me ‘no you’re not crazy for feeling weird’ or ‘oh you’re crazy this is a totally normal type of interaction in the context of Northern Chinese culture’ I guess.  What do you ladies think?  I feel like my ‘lady defense’ shield is always up but maybe it shouldn’t be?",

    "text": "Should I continue to sleep with my friend? [Disclaimer: As of right now, I am 18 soon to be 19. If you read this post, you'll quickly figure out that I am quite young. I was slightly conflicted between posting this on here or r/Teenagers, but I remembered 13 year olds are over there. I understand that this is an adult issue, so I would like some adult perspective. I guess I am explicitly stating this because I don't want to be talked down to. I know sex comes with this clusterfuck of feelings and issues and conflicts, so on and so forth. I always use condoms, get tested regularly for STDs and I have Mirena inserted. I love having sex, but I want to hold on to the pretense of having a \"future\". I promise you that my Christian mother who had me at 22 has talked to me enough.]\n\nQuick background/rant, sorry:\n\nWe have been really close friends since 11th grade and by our senior year of high school, we had both been in relationships for over a year. But, after some talking, sexting, etc, for a few months, we decided to have sex. I think it was supposed to be a one time thing, but we have been seeing each other off and on since January of this year. I broke up with my boyfriend the day after the first time, but he has still been with his girlfriend. I think I kept seeing him the earlier half of this year because it made me feel less alone. Plus, it has different with him so far.. like sex is unbelievably good.\n\nThe last time I came home (Thanksgiving) he told me that his girlfriend wanted to sleep with someone else of a specific race, so they made an agreement that he could have sex with someone else as well. (If you think this is weird, trust me, so do I.) Since, we have already been seeing each other, he asked me if I wanted to, and of course I said yes. (MORE Background: I go to a university with 50,000+ students. I know I might find someone decent eventually.. but the guys I have been with so far suck in terms of sex.)\n\nMy senior year I felt really bad sleeping with him (+ guilty for cheating). Looking back now I think I was really jealous of his girlfriend and confused with why he was sabotaging his relationship. I know my self-esteem is wrapped up in this still; I am trying to figure out how. For one, I have never wanted to date him (obviously, he cheats, among other reasons). I have always felt jealous seeing them together at school, pictures of her on the internet, etc. Despite just getting out of a relationship, not wanting another one because I knew I was going off to college, maybe... I subconsciously wanted to be with someone?\n\nNow, I am a freshman in college. I have been back home twice and I saw him both times. I really like seeing him. Despite everything else, he is a really good friend of mine and I always have a fun time with him. I think early December while I was prepping for finals he told me that for sure he didn't want to do this anymore. (He has been extremely on and off this entire year.) I agreed because I have always let him decide. I think ONCE, I have texted him first. I really like seeing him and I know I'm going to have a good time, so why say no? But, whenever he would tell me that he wanted to stop, I respected that. Until November, we had seen each other maybe once a month up until August. We go weeks without talking, then he hits me up. I don't mean to be so easy with him, but it is such a chill situation.\n\nOn the other hand, I get bothered by this notion and the posts that circulate the internet that say something along the lines of \"Guys always cheat on a 10 with a 5\" and \"They do it because the 5 is easy to get\". Shit like this. I hate seeing it, because all I think is about this situation. His girlfriend is fucking gorgeous. I know I shouldn't compare myself to anyone, but it's hard. She is feminine, curvy, has beautiful longish dark, curly hair and pretty skin. I am mainly skinny (as a black girl, this isn't the most ideal shape) and look like a 12 year old boy. I don't like the idea of being that sorry \"5\". \n\nFurthermore, I have mixed feelings about him having a girlfriend. I like it because I feel comfortable knowing that this is merely a friends with benefits situation, but I feel bad for her. So many times I want to DM her and tell her that she is beautiful and (probably) smart and funny and talented and she should not be with this loser. (She is a senior in HS now.) I want to tell her that she deserves so much better and she has her whole life ahead of her and she has no reason to stay with this lame ass dude. She will eventually find someone that isn't so emotionally dependent on other people that they cheat when she needs time to herself. But, that \"loser\" is my friend and I can't do that to him. I know he loves her and is good to her, but still.\n\nNow, him and his girlfriend have decided to take a break after New Year's. For them, that means being \"basically single\". Naturally, he texted me and asked if I would be willing to see him and I said yes. But, now I am conflicted; being in college, I am too busy to care about any repercussions, because I see him, then I leave. HOWEVER, when I do care I feel ugly in terms of my personality and my personal appearance, like I'm that \"sorry 5\". I guess I'm asking should I remove myself from this situation permanently or should I continue see him?\n\nTL;DR - I've been the side chick of a good friend of mine for almost a year now. It kind of makes me feel shit about myself, but he is really good in bed and I enjoy the dynamic of our friendship. (No feelings, time in-between, optional, etc.) I'm in town for a few more weeks, should I see him  or should I stop seeing him for good?",

    "text": "Looking for comments/reactions to this incident that recently occurred at my school Very upsetting thing happened recently at the high school where I work and would like people’s reactions/thoughts because I really can’t wrap my head around it. It is a little long and detailed so bear with me.\n\nA teacher was non-renewed for next year. Although the full reasons are between this teacher and admin, I was told by another teacher who had talked to the non-renewed teacher, it was due to inappropriate relationships with students – nothing sexual, but texting, giving rides to students, being friends on social media, etc. of which this teacher who told me confirmed by showing me a snapchat of the non-renewed teacher’s story of a pic of the non-renewed teacher driving with a student in their car. Added to this, there were supposedly other issues as well with this teacher’s professionalism/practices. I don’t know the teacher personally and never really interacted with them other than a few polite conversations. \n\nThe day the teacher was told they would be non-renewed, the teacher broke down in front of their class, crying, explaining they had been wrongly terminated, it was unfair, unjust, etc.\nIn response to this, students got intensely upset and angry, deeming that there had been an injustice done as many really liked this teacher. This fervor grew throughout the day, although from my POV, I just held class as normal, hearing this and that through students from claims of racism (the non-renewed teacher was a minority) to students arguing back and forth over the cause of the teacher’s non-renewal of which they really could only speculate. I would shut these conversations down best I could, reminding them that speculating leads to rumors which hurts people and I just said we wouldn’t be discussing the issue. \nSeveral to many students were absent from every one of my classes. It turns out, they were staging a broken sort of protest; an attempted sit-in, talking about walking out, because of the perceived injustice that they thought occurred. After the fact, I learned that students were verbally assaulting administration (swearing, calling them names) and demanding the teacher not be let go. Large swathes of students were storming the guidance area to demand the teacher be allowed to come back and refusing to go to class. Although I didn’t see any of it, supposedly, social media was lit up by terrible comments aimed at the administration, specifically, the principal. The non-renewed teacher left after their first class so wasn’t directly involved. \nIt reached the point where, at the end of the day, the principal, obviously shattered and holding back tears over the intercom, tried to quell the situation by explaining that such comments led to him and others feeling very hurt and wanting to reassure others who weren’t involved that this wasn’t with the true culture of our school – it came off as an odd mix of heartfelt pain of being abused all day by students, and a weird balance of working to not directly condemn any students behavior at the same time. Basically, he just sounded exasperated and hurt and was pleading with students to try and contain their emotions and negative comments in-person and on social media.\nWe received an email the following morning asking us to be extra aware of student’s emotional state and allow them to skip class to head to guidance if they felt they needed to express their concern, anger, etc. Just a few students (in my classes at least) did this. The email also contained more admin speak about the culture of our school not reflecting the anger and rude things said on social media and that our duty was to first protect the emotional state of students during this difficult incident. Aside from a little more gossip about the issue and students arguing over it, I believe there were students trying to get signatures to reinstate the teacher, and groups of students were dressed up in certain colors in support of the teacher with hashtags written on them #FreeFIREDTEACHER. Class went on generally as normal but with more admin/teachers regularly in the halls - that’s about it.\nThe previous day, admin. allowed students to amass outside their doors and holler swears and insults at them all day, students were not told to go back to class, explaining to them that their feelings were valid and more or less accepting the idea that, yes, the teacher had been unfairly let go. From what I understood from other teachers talking about the issue, students believed that the teacher was non-renewed over a trivial issue, something involving making a poster for their door that some students didn’t like because they perceived it as offensive and the principal had the non-renewed teacher to take it down – this was months ago. \nFurthermore, no students were punished for either skipping class or their outrage/blatant disrespect toward admin. It seemed that teachers, myself included, just largely stayed out of the issue and watched in awe as students roiled over something they really had no idea or right to get so upset about – yes, this second year teacher may have been a favorite teacher of some, but they had no idea the real reason this teacher was let go and exploded in a rage that grew and grew throughout the day, initially spurred by the action of the non-renewed teacher and a mess of ugliness on social media.\nWhy I can’t shake this issue is – why did admin. let this occur and what does that say about the institution of our school, perhaps all schools, that this kind of thing was handled this way? Thoughts? Reactions? Has anything like this happened at your school? Do you think anything would ever happen at your school or would it be handled differently?",

I would also be teaching 2 AP classes.   I would be making 10% more money than job B and the cost of living is lower where this job is located.  I also would not have to move. The principal at job A is better his job and the school as a whole is better than the school in job B. I don't really enjoy living in this area though.  Not much to do and people are kind of closed off.  \n\nJob B: is teaching the same subject and grade (freshman English) that I taught last year.  I had great success and fantastic test scores last year.   Job B is located 8 hours closer to my parents and my best friend and his family lives in the area.  I would be moving 700 miles for this job.  I also would be living in a more urban area which I have mixed feelings about.  There is much more to do in this area and I have many more friends and acquaintances.  Less pay and higher cost of living and there will be much more time sitting in traffic.\n\nYour thoughts, oh wise sages of reddit?\n\nI can answer any follow up questions if needed.",

I've only taught ELA, but when something comes up regarding race and I say \"black\", someone will cheekily say \"it's AFRICAN-AMERICAN!\", or when I say \"African-American,\" someone will cheekily say \"Just say BLACK, I'm not from Africa!\"\n\nIn reality, I just mix it up based on what sounds better in the given sentence. I probably say \"black\" more because African-American is hard to say with a lot of syllables.

    "text": "Update to \"I think I'm in over my head\". So 6 months ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4xx4ac/i_think_im_in_over_my_head/\n\nHere's a summary of my first semester in my district's alternative program:\n\nWe were 4 teachers: 3 alternative certification (no teacher training or experience) and 1 long term sub. We also had one first year Behavior Management Specialist.\n\nWe had up to 75 students. These kids are in 6-12. They come to our program for 45-180 days after expulsion hearings or when they're released from the Department of Juvenile Justice. Some are the real deal, with violent criminals history, gang affiliation, fights in school and on the bus, and they're frequently in and out of jail. Some were caught with drugs in school (weed or xanax). Some just had too many office referrals. A few have IEPs, but most are unmedicated and their IEPs are only loosely followed at best. Many more have undiagnosed LDs. Only a handful come from decent homes. \n\nThe vast majority of them are loud and uninterested in school, but most are decent, respectful kids if you treat them like human beings. Some will curse you out, but I really like almost all of them. \n\nSo they end up with us for one reason or another. And we're supposed to run a very strict, structured, highly restrictive, punitive program. It's supposed to scare them straight. It's supposed to feel like jail. We have 4 blocks, 4 teachers, and 4  mixed classes. One middle school, one mixed middle and high, and two high school, all with kids in different classes.\n\nMy certification is for MS Social Studies and History and HS History (NOT Social Studies). I have students who are supposed to be doing everything from US History and Constitution to 7th grade World History. If they're actually assigned a social studies class. Many are supposed to be working on things like Health, ROTC, Spanish, Economics, Marketing, Law Education, Art, and Earth Science in my class. I don't speak Spanish. I'm not certified to teach any of those things. Even if I just follow the curriculum, I have 16 other kids in other classes I'm supposed to be teaching at the same time. Even when I have a couple kids in the same class, they're in vastly different places in the curriculum.\n\nThe kids all have tablets. They're supposed to work on Edgenuity, which aligns with the classes in their home schools and should keep them on track if they're self-motivated enough to keep up. None of them are. It's a boring, unengaging, tedious program that shows videos, asks questions, and then quizzes them. Endlessly. They do this in all 4 blocks every day, with a 20 minute break for lunch.\n\nThe principal says to do enrichment, too. Blended learning, she says. But I can't expect my social studies kids to be cool with a whole bunch of extra work that I'm not qualified to give to the Spanish kids. And I can't give enrichment that doesn't directly relate to the Edgenuity lesson each kid is currently doing. I can't take away from the time they could be completing their Edgenuity if I can't offer a direct substitute for the lesson. And I can't do that.\n\nSo we expect these kids to sit from 9 to 3. And I mean sit. They are not to get up. They are not offered any activity ever (which goes really well for the 7th graders). They are not to use their tablets for anything else, ever. They are **absolutely not allowed to listen to music, ever**. They have no freedom to move at all. They must be accompanied to the bathroom in twos, so I can't just take the whole class. They are not allowed water bottles, and cannot get water on their own.\n\nUltimately, it's a huge academic setback. The kids with minor behavior issues end up getting worse, and the kids with serious behavior issues don't get any better.\n\nThen there's our admin. Remember that were three first year alternative certification teachers, a LTS, and a first year BMS. We are very isolated, even from our principal. She's on the other side of the building, through the district office. Our AP was about 45 months pregnant all of last semester, and spent most of her time on the other side with the principal. This left us alone. Very, very alone. We do not do searches. Kids can't bring backpacks, but we don't search and there's no metal detector. Oh, we're also the only school in the district without a resource officer.\n\nWe were having discipline issues (surprise). Principal told us it was because we weren't doing enough, weren't doing our jobs, and she wouldn't do disciplinary stuff until we did. Ha.\n\nWe would call for help, and it would take 10 minutes, minimum, for someone to come help us. If the kids attacked a teacher and took over the class, nobody would know for at least 40 minutes, and up to 2 hours. Even then, what's our very pregnant AP going to do?\n\nWe've never had a fire drill. My room has only 1 door and no windows.\n\nOur SPED teacher is often off campus at the vocational school (which is attended by only the most hopeless students). This leaves IEP kids with IEPs that aren't being followed.\n\nWe've begged for PE. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a resource officer. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for radios. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a planning period. Nothing.\n\nThis program is a disgrace. It's a holding tank for the kids the district doesn't want on their expulsion record but doesn't want in real classes. They're waiting for these kids to drop out or get locked up. It's cruel and horrible, and I'm putting in for a transfer.\n\nBut I love the kids, and I love my co-workers, and I know I'm going to love a real classroom.\n\nSo that's it. It's awful, but not because of the kids, and not because of me.",

    "text": "Does anybody here have a sibling who contributes to the Black dating issues? I mean the typical issues like the idea that non Black women/men are better than Black people. My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

    "text": "A Socialist Defense of Gender Roles Edit: wow.  I've never seen such quick downvotes.   Remember that this is supposed to be a discussion forum not an ideological purity contest.   Only downvote if you think this post has contributed nothing to the debate.   \n\nEdit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   \n\nUnusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  \n\nMRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "How to deal with a \"sexual harassment\" claim you feel is false or frivolous? So we hired a new girl in the office, and she is pretty talkative. She often strikes up conversation about various topics with her fellow employees. We are a small office of 15. Every Friday we eat lunch together.\n\nDuring a recent lunch the girl decided to discuss the topic of \"discrimination in the workplace based on gender\", she talked about how she felt it was hard to land a job in the tech industry because she was a woman. That once she lands in the job that there is a very prominent wage gap.\n\nA fellow employee said he believed the age gap to be a myth and that being a woman in tech actually has quite a few advantages.\n\nThe entire conversation was casual, without any animosity shown from either side. Just a calm discussion. I was literally sitting right next to them. I heard the entire thing! But later that day this employee came to my office and demanded the employee be punished for his \"insensitive remarks\", I refused. She has gone over my head and has filed a complaint with HR. I am now under pressure from the home office to terminate this 3 year veteran because they wish to avoid any negative press that could come as the result of a lawsuit.\n\nThis man did nothing wrong in my eyes. This new hire brought the topic up, she engaged him, and at no point let him know that she felt uncomfortable about the subject matter. The employee they wish me to terminate is my best, most hardworking employee.\n\nWhat do I do?\n\n---\nI read a lot of these comments, and I'd like to clarify that context of this conversation. I had already attempted to recreate the conversation on my notebook, since I'm sure I'll have to comb through it. From my recollection this is about 99% accurate. Maybe not in the exact words used, but in tone.\n\n---\nTranscript of Conversation\n---\n\n**Woman:** \"Hey, what do you all think about gender discrimination in the workplace? I think its a big issue, and that it isn't fair that women get paid less than men for doing the same job. I mean why should a woman have to suffer in the interview process just because she isn't a man. You know what I'm saying. Its ridiculous\"\n\n**Man:** \"I actually think that the wage gap is a myth. If you look at the studies it appears that men as a whole make more than women, but they are comparing two genders as a whole, not the individual reason's why. Women don't actually get paid less than men, that is illegal, and ridiculous.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"But then why do men make more than woman?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, most men tend to work longer hours and collect overtime. This also tends to lead to more promotions which in turns lead to higher salary. For example, more women tend to work part time jobs than men, since they are family oriented. This also leads to them leaving the company more often than men, because many will leave their jobs to concentrate on motherhood.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"But that doesn't justify paying them less.\"\n\n**Man:** \"No I totally agree with you. What I'm saying is that they are not getting paid less at all. They are making the same pay, but due to more women working part time jobs and not receiving promotions due to putting in less hours, the studies numbers are off.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"How are the studies off?\"\n\n**Man:** \"The studies are correct in that they take the same amount of men and women with the same jobs, and add up their salaries, but its not relevant to proving a Wage Gap, since it does not take into account hours worked. Meaning, both are getting paid the same amount, but men simply work more hours, so the numbers are inflated.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Any type of discrimination is wrong, no matter how many hours a woman works, she should be paid the same.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Oh yes, I totally agree. But what I'm saying is that the numbers in the studies that's support the wage gap just appear higher on the men's side because more hours are worked. They are paid the same. Meaning, that if we are both hired for the same job, at the same time, for the same payscale and then I work 60 hours a week, and you work 40 hours, and somebody were to compare our paychecks and then ask why is my pay higher than yours, then logical answer is because I worked more hours.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Well not all women are hired on at the same pay.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, when that happens I surely doubt its immediately because of gender discrimination. It is usually because a person just negotiated a better salary during the higher process.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Why do men get to negotiate salary?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Everybody can negotiate salary. Being a good negotiator has nothing to do with gender. Maybe that person had more work experience, or simply had a better 3 month plan. So many factors its impossible to know. However, you will run into a lot of jerks that will discriminate based on a bunch of stupid things. I was once fit shamed out of a job, because I looked intimidating and made the developers uncomfortable. Or so I was told.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"That's terrible, did that really happen?\"\n\n**Man:** \"Yes, they asked me if I could wear baggier shirts to work, and when I asked why that's what they told me, so I quit. I've also seen discrimination work against men just as it does women. At several of my past companies some of the pig headed managers hired attractive, newly graduated college girls over more qualified applicants just so they could have something to look at. Or as they justified it, improve office morale.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"Wow, that sounds terrible. How often does that happen.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Quite a lot I believe. But either way anybody who discriminates is doing so because they are an asshole. Not because there is some widespread corporate conspiracy to suppress a certain race or gender. Some people suck, and others are cool. As is life. But honestly I would say that in today's current climate being a woman has its advantages. Many companies feel pressured to hire women just to avoid being classified as justifying the wage gap. Particularly in tech. When you start going to conferences you'll see at least a dozen different panels about empowering women in tech or the workplace. You wont find any of those for men. So, its a widespread agenda that companies need to hire more women, and that definitely will work towards your advantage.\"\n\n**Woman:** \"I don't think if I agree with that.\"\n\n**Man:** \"Well, eitherway I still think the Wage Gap is a myth that has been debunked with numbers and research, so rest assured, despite what the media tells you, you are always going to get equal pay. If not, then you can sue.\"\n\n**Woman shrugs and changes subject.**\n\n*This is a throwaway account",

    "text": "Help - Being \"Professionally\" Bullied at Work **Background:** I currently work in the advertising industry, specifically Digital Ad Operations, for a big-name company. My job is to work on the technical side of things, generating (not by hand) the code necessary to make ads display on websites (among other things) and then deliver them to contacts at websites such as Facebook, YouTube, etc. I've work in an office setting before, but this is my first job out of college. In my experience, and also in what I've read and seen, it's general a job that is \"tailored\" to straight-out-of-college employees. You are not expected to have any prior knowledge of the job, but you *are* expected to be competent enough to pick it up quickly. In other words, it's not something you study for in college. The job is request-based by nature, meaning you get an email with the task, confirm receipt, do it, and then confirm that it's finished. I've worked here for a little over 2 years now. \n\n-----------------------\n\n**The Issues:** Since I've been here, I haven't been promoted. I understand that this is something earned. However, going from entry level to Senior is not something particularly difficult. Half of it is about doing a good job, while the other half of it is just...a participation award, really. Meaning, just do your work and eventually you will/should get promoted. Since I've been here, I noticed that performance reviews are not a thing; in my over 2 years here, I have not had one. I've asked for one several times, and I've gotten mixed responses ranging from, **Director:** *\"Well, I've reached out to upper management about a formal process, but haven't heard back\"*, to *\"Eventually, we will get to that.\"* The problem with this is that since I've been here, I've barely gotten any positive feedback. I've seen waves of coworkers promoted (which is a $13,000 increase in pay), while I remain a entry level, despite overwhelmingly-positive feedback from other director and managers that I work with. Even those I've never met in person, and who I've only spoken with on the phone. I have a reputation for going above and beyond to resolve issues when I can help it. I won't lie and pretend that I haven't made any mistakes, but I would say that the majority of my work is objectively very good. I've lost track of how many times I've ended up in meeting rooms with my director and new manager (who was previously my supervisor and was promoted). The topics have ranged from:\n\n\n\n* **Lateness:** It is true that I had issues arriving on time way back when I started, but I've made great strides to arrive on time or even early. For reference, I work in NYC, and there are train issues almost every day. I've come to realize that this is my problem and mine alone, and that I need to work around this. However, what really bothers me is that I broke my wrist in February and notified my manager that I needed extra time to get ready in the morning. She said this was okay. I arrived in the office one morning sometime between 9:45 AM and 10 AM, and my director immediately called me into a meeting room. She opened with a rude and sarcastic remark, and then told me that she was reporting me to HR for arriving late so often. I showed her my broken wrist and she acted like she didn't know, which is impossible considering she and my manager speak often, even if she's never actually in the office. She asked me if I needed disability leave, and I said no. Eventually the meeting ended, and she still reported me to HR. I visited HR to explain my situation, and the woman understood.\n\n* **Unexplained absences from my desk:** This one has never really been elaborated on; it's just kind of tacked on with no examples. I get up to go to the bathroom, get a coffee or water, or just stretch my legs. I might go across he street to Starbucks or something, but it's not as if I'm gone for more than 15 minutes. My job is a desk job, and in the words of my previous manager, sometimes you need a break from the screen as the work can become a blur. My work still gets done in a timely manner. Additionally, we don't get paid during our lunch breaks, yet my manager told me that the director said *\"If you have time to take a lunch break, you're not busy.\"*\n\n* **\"Sitting\" on requests:** My director claims I sit on work before starting it, but that isn't true. My team and I CC each other on emails/work that involves us all, but not work that is specific to one person. When I have been busy with such work, I notify my team so they know that I'm working on something and can't assist them with anything else. \n\n* **\"Unnecessary pushback on work\":** Absolutely no idea where this is coming from. If we receive a request that isn't sent in the correct format, we kindly ask the person(s) sending it to resubmit it correctly. Again, not really sure where this is coming from. \n\n----------------------\n\n**Other Concerns:**\n\n* The environment is very much upper management looking after themselves. My director hires people who do little to no work to work with her/under her. She promoted a manager who is almost never in the office to an Associate Director position, a position which never existed until then. This Associate Director told us that her \"role is undefined\" when my manager asked her why she doesn't help us out\n\n* My director is a people-pleaser. She doesn't defend us at all; she lets our team take the fall for everything\n\n* My manager quit because she was thrown under the bus by my director and her name and reputation became tarnished in the company; another company that we pay to QA our ads let something pass QA that shouldn't have, and my manager got in trouble instead of representatives from that company. \n\n* My director hired *another* Associate Director rather than promote my manager, which roadblocked her career, which was the final straw for her and ultimately the reason she left. This new AD doesn't know how to do the work.\n\n* I've witnessed my director fire an employee of 10 years, who had an 8-month pregnant girlfriend, semi-publicly; he came out of a meeting room crying and was told to grab and his stuff and leave. The company hired him back the same day in another department. She did the same to another coworker, no bag or box provided.\n\n* We have lost 12 people in a year, on a team of about 20. I think we're about 8-10 people now. For every 3 or so people who leave, we get 1 new person. The team has been understaffed for a while, and it's a universal concern among my coworkers. We get the usual, \"We're interviewing\" from upper management, but it seems like they don't care about retention. This is a concern because training people to be able to do this job autonomously takes a lot of time and babysitting, for lack of a better term. Additionally the work becomes stressed and strained with the additional workload, due to the nature of the job\n\n* Previously, I had a senior (one who started 7 months after me, and who I had trained...), a supervisor, and a manager. All 3 of them have left the company for pretty much the same reasons. My team (meaning my immediate team) is just me and a new employee who started about 2 months ago, who I have been managing and training. I currently work on/own the biggest account that the company has (a huge consumer products company I cannot mention), as well as a second account, and my new AD has been trying to get me to help out on a third against my insistence that I cannot handle that workload\n\n-------------- \n\n**Current Situation/Why I'm Posting:** My director called a meeting between HR, the new AD (who has been there for about a month), and myself last week. She never told me HR would be there, but when I saw the woman come into the office I packed my things in anticipation of being fired (NY is an At-Will Employment State). While I was nervous, I thought that this would be the end of my sleepless nights, stomach issues from nervousness, and fear/hatred of coming to work. I had started looking for new jobs recently because I had given up hope of getting Senior and being able to apply with that on my resume.  I get into the meeting room, and I notice everyone has a 3-page paper in front of them. My director puts on the good cop impression and starts talking to me about the things I outlined above. I countered them and even provided printed emails from recently, going back two years of the contrary (especially about my quality of work and my reputation within the company). I even showed how she was on these email chains. She didn't care and said something to the effect of, \"While others outside of this department may think you do a great job, I don't.\" I also explained how I am carrying the workload of at least 3 other people/former employees. She still didn't care. The HR woman just sat there taking notes. Eventually she tried to shut me up by saying it was pointless arguing the past, and gave me this Performance Warning/Improvement Plan to look over and sign. It basically details the issues and how we're going to fix them (which are things I have already been doing). I was completely shocked, but took the paper without signing it. At the bottom is a blurb about how NY is an At-Will Employment state and how they can let me go at any time (I knew this already). \n\nOne of my coworkers who left to a competitor referred me at his new place, and I've completed the final round of interviews last week. I feel like I have a very good chance of getting it. I also have a lot of job opportunities/offers from friends and previous coworkers, totally unrelated to this situation. I'm afraid of being fired, but I **do not** want to sign this paper because I don't agree with what I'm being accused of. I've drafted counter-points to send back to the HR woman rather than the signed document, but I fully expect this to be a one-way street. \n\n**What is the correct thing to do in this situation?** I've felt bullied throughout my entire career here, and I feel like the negative feedback has really damaged me over time. It hurt my self-worth and made me feel drained of energy and on-edge/nervous all the time. That's why it took me so long to find the will to leave to another job. I know not to sign this document, but I'm afraid that I'm going to fired immediately. I also know that because I have more experience than most people here, and because I \"own\" the largest account the company has, they will be screwed if I leave on a whim (or even 2 weeks). So I'm kind of in this limbo, where I think they're trying scare tactics on me, but I'm not sure. Thus far, it's been a domino effect of people leaving, and a lot of people who left have shared similar sentiments.",

I was sitting at my desk when a lady walked up, wanting assistance to order checks. She was older, seemed nice.\n\nShe sat down and I was pulling up the check order system when she goes, \"thank god you're not one of those brown people.\"\nI was taken aback. I couldn't have heard that right. \"Excuse me?\" Was all I could even think to say.\n\"I can never understand those Mexicans. And they can't help me. Thank goodness you're not one.\"\nI take a lot of shit at work. But that type doesn't fly. I gave her back her debit card and told her that if she wished to speak like that she could leave. She continued while she tried to take out her ID card, which was expired anyways. I told her I would not be able to help her today, and that she would be welcome to come back when she could speak about other human beings in a respectful manner.\n\nI know it's not a big thing, but that...I can't tolerate that.\n\nThanks for listening.\n\nEdit: To clarify some things. I work at a bank, and my manager heard the conversation and backed me up. We have a no tolerance policy for hate. I was firm but polite, I did NOT demean her. She did not make a scene. She said okay and left.\nAlso, I am also brown. I am mixed and my husband and his family are Mexican.",

    "text": "My gynecologist diagnosed me with chlamydia in August of 2015 and I just found out yesterday. I'm freaking out. I'm about to word vomit all of my thoughts/feelings because I feel like there are very few real-life friends I can talk to about this stuff. TwoX has always been a supportive community in the past, so I'm hoping you all can talk me through this. I'm using a throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm going to start with what I think is some necessary background information. When I went away to college (2009), I made a vow to myself to get tested every year at my annual exam - which happens to always been in August. So August 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2014 - I was tested and confirmed negative for everything.\n\nIn September of 2013, I started dating a dude (K) and things got serious. We moved in together in January of 2014. Even though I was in a faithful, monogamous relationship, I decided to still get tested at my yearly exam in August 2014 and 2015. In 2014, my doctor called to let me know everything was fine. In 2015, I never heard anything from my doctor, but assumed \"no news is good news\" and went about my business. I had started graduate school and was working a crazy demanding job...so it was the last thing on my mind. I went again in August of 2016 and when they asked if I wanted to be tested, I declined. I had been in a serious relationship for SO LONG, there was no way I contracted anything and I didn't want to shell out the extra cash.\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I got the Nexplanon put in a week or so ago and went to the doctor for my follow up. My doctor is new to me (the last two gynecologists I saw have since moved offices), and was doing a review of my medical history with me. She asked, \"I see you never came in for a follow up for your chlamydia in 2015. Does that ever cause any problems for you?\"\n\nI stared at her. \"I've never had chlamydia.\" \n\n\"I could have sworn I just saw that on my chart! Let me double check.\"\n\nWhile she flipped through the system, I explained, \"Yeah there's no way. I was in a super serious relationship at that time, and if I would have tested positive - that would have definitely been a red flag and I'd CERTAINLY remember. We didn't break up until July of 2016, so there's no way. Plus I would definitely remember hearing that.\" I wasn't freaking out - I figured she just had me mixed up with someone else. I actually thought it was kind of funny and started texting a friend to tell her about the silly mix-up.\n\nThen she turned the screen to me and confirmed. Yup - I tested positive in August of 2015. It's now March of 2017 and this is the first I'm hearing of it. I tried explaining \"But I have none of those symptoms! I never have!\" She gently (and visibly uncomfortably) explained that a lot of times, chlamydia is asymptomatic. I couldn't stop crying as she quickly retested me and tried to calm me down. I could tell she felt awful for being the messenger. \n\nI was a hysterical mess. I spent my afternoon calling every supervisor, wondering how they could have managed to NOT let me know. I was choking on tears on second and screaming with rage the next. I was in the throws of a full-on panic attack at one point. Turns out, there was a typo in my phone number. They attempted to contact me 3 times, and when there was no response (WRONG NUMBER), they stopped trying. They called a prescription into my pharmacy, but they couldn't reach me either. Because the phone number was one digit off. \n\nI have gone to the doctor 5-6 times since then. No one's mentioned it. No one's checked. I even went once for a yeast infection. ITCHING AND BURNING! Shouldn't SOMEONE have glanced at my file and raised an eyebrow?! The head honcho at the doctor's office accredited the oversight to staff turnover. Since both doctors left, it just kind of fell through the cracks. She was mortified and profusely apologetic. I think she felt bad listening to me hyperventilate over the phone.\n\nAnyway. I had to have that difficult conversation with my new partner. He was incredibly supportive and understanding. What a perfect, beautiful man I've found. \n\nBut I'm really struggling. I understand chlamydia is very treatable and really \"not a big deal\"....but I feel absolutely disgusting. I feel filthy. I'm humiliated that my ex cheated (and didn't use protection) and I had no clue. I'm terrified that there are going to be long term consequences for having left this untreated for so long. Everything I read online says PID or cervical cancer. Fuck. Because of a typo in my phone number. \n\nI feel like I'm overreacting, but I cannot stop crying. I came to work today and I keep having to excuse myself to the bathroom to choke back tears. \n\nWhat should I do? How can my doctor make this right? Can they even do anything? How do I get over this disgusting tainted feeling that I have? Any advice is appreciated and desperately needed. \n\nI probably didn't explain myself well. I'm at work and venting on my lunch break. Please ask questions if anything is unclear. I'll be checking throughout the afternoon and when I get home later this evening.\n\nTLDR - I tested positive for chlamydia and went unnotified for almost 2 years.",

    "text": "I need some advice, possibly legal advice. I am the resident pediatrician for a small private hospital in Africa. I got into work today and found a situation. \n\nA 7 month old baby was brought in last night for cough and fever. The doctor prescribed amoxyclav and paracetamol suppository. Pharmacy for one reason or other dispensed pantoprazole 40mg oral tablet to the parents instead of the suppository. The parents read the prospectus and realised the blunder. They have made it known that they intend to sue the hospital. We don't know if the pantoprazole was actually given p.r.\n\nManagement has requested that I be there when the parents return all lawyered up. The hospital and pharmacist is clearly in the wrong here. How can I make this better for us, and more importantly, the child? Haven't been involved in any legal problems thus far, let alone medicolegal. How should I handle this as the pediatrician? What are some of the things I should be weary of?\n\nEDIT: The child was given the pantoprazole p.r. We have called our lawyer. We have called the parents as well to bring the child in for review and monitoring over the next 24 hours. They have agreed. Waiting for them to rock up. Hoping for an amicable conclusion to this. Admin will do as they please with the pharm tech.\n\nEDIT 2: Met the parents and child. They were very calm and amicable. No lawyers. Child was still febrile obviously since they had no antipyretic. On taking history the problem became a bit more clear. The pharm tech dispensed the brand name Panto-Denk instead of Para-Denk. What saved the day was that the mother managed to retrieve the tablet a few minutes after p.r. insertion when they realised it was a wrong medication. They showed it to me. It was pretty much intact. I gave them the correct medication, apologised and sent them home to return after 3 days for review. I hope that closes the case. Advised chief of pharmacy to address the actual problem at hand i.e. mix up of meds. \n\nThank you all for you advice and contributions.",

    "text": "I had a psychotic breakdown at work This will be a very long post. But I feel like it's worth reading. As fellow nurses, you all know that we stretch ourselves too thin. We work long hours. We have stressful shifts. We push our bodies and our minds over and over again. For our patients. For our coworkers. For our families. We all know that we should take care of ourselves. We all know we should eat better, exercise more, drink less. Stop saying yes to picking up extra shifts. Stop going without sleep so we can spend time with our friends and families on our off days. Of course we know all that. But we're nurses, it's just what our life is like. So we keep going. Until we break. This is my story about my break.\n\nI had worked 3 night shifts in a row. Nothing new. I've always worked nights. I hadn't slept well at all, also not new. I've been taking meds for insomnia for about 5 years. I was on call from 2300-0700 for night number 4. I had got somebody to cover the first 4 hours of my call because I wanted to go to a mystery theater dinner thing. The day after shift 3 I didn't sleep. At all. Just could not fall asleep, even with drugs.  I should have skipped the dinner and tried harder to get some sleep. But I was really looking forward to it so I got up an I went. And then of course I got a text saying they would need me at 2300. I was already so tired, my eyes were burning and my face was flushed. I was over emotional already. But they needed me so I had to go. \n\nI work in L&D. I've been at this unit for about a year. Before this I worked step down. I'm pretty comfortable in L&D now. Still haven't encountered a lot of things but for the most part I'm confident in my skills. When I get to work the unit is slammed. And there are 2 triages that had just come in that my charge nurse gives me. Both are rule out labor. As soon as I start working I realize I'm kind of off. I go to the supply room for something and totally forget what. I stare at a fetal strip forever before being able to analyze it. I forget where to go in our charting system to get to certain things. One of the triages is fine, going to be discharged. The other is 38 weeks and having contractions every 2-7 minutes. Her cervix is 2/60/-2. Her doctor happens to be on the unit for another delivery so I let her hang out on the monitors to wait to see what the doctor wants to do. So I start working on discharging the other patient. About half an hour or so later I've discharged the other patient and the MD gets out of the other delivery. She looks at the strip and says \"She's having lates. Why haven't you admitted her?\" I look at her strip (even though I'd been checking it regularly and it looked okay) and see she HAS been having deceleration. Go in the room and patient is obviously in pain. Recheck her she's 4/80/-1. I try to get an IV so I can start her bolus for an epidural. I'm flustered and scared, I have the volume on the monitor up and I can hear baby's heart rate keeps dipping. I can't get the IV. I go to get some help. The other nurse gets the IV quickly and I start a bolus, turn the patient to the left and put her on some oxygen. Strip still looks iffy but I just can't really get a good picture of what's going on. I don't know what to do. So I go out to the nurse's station and ask somebody else to take a look at it. \"Oh yeah, looks like she started having variables here. And then they turn into lates here. And now her variability is minimal.\" I start crying. It was like a faucet got turned on. I can not calm myself down and stop crying. Everybody surrounds me and keeps asking me \"How can I help you? What can I do?\" And I can't even think straight to know what to ask them to do. So my charge nurse switches around assignments and I give the labor patient away and get some post partum patients instead.\n\nThe next few hours are horrible. I keep crying randomly, my eyes are so swollen and my face is red. I can't concentrate on anything. I'm having a hard time keeping up with which patient needs what. All the nurses keep looking at me like \"You poor thing\" and being overly sugary and sweet towards me. \n\nAround 0530 thing start getting worse. I was looking at a nurse telling her something about the labor patient I had and I thought that I saw her eyes dilating and then contracting back. I kept staring straight into her eyes. I would tilt my head to left and then back to center over and over, all while looking into their eyes and seeing them dilate and contract over and over. I snapped out of it after about thirty seconds and was terrified. The nurse was obviously a little freaked out and kept asking if I was okay. I tried to shake it off and kept telling myself the shift was almost over. I'd be able to sleep soon. But then it happened again. My heart was pounding and I started hyperventilating. At this point all of the nurses are very worried about me. My charge nurse talks me into going to the ER. I try to call my boyfriend as my charge nurse walks me down to the ER but he doesn't pick up. Once in the ER ever person I interact with I think is in this little \"trance\" where their eyes glass over and dilate while I stare. I start to think that I'm somehow infecting these people when I look at them and making them go into a trance.\n\nThe get me back to triage quickly. My HR and BP are through the roof. I can hardly talk at this point. I'm trying to explain how I'm feeling to the triage nurse but every time I look at him he starts going into this trance. I really start panicking at this time. I keep telling the triage nurse to get help because I'm making him sick. I keep going over ACLS steps in my head because I think that either I'm about to code or this triage nurse is. My boyfriend calls me back at this point and I tell him to get to the ER because I feel like I'm coding. \n\nThey get me back to a room. Every single person that comes in I think is in this trance. They seem like they're walking slow and moving slow. Their eyes are glazed, pupils dilated. Speech is slow. The nurse and doctor step out at one point and I press the code blue button in the room because I'm certain I'm dying. My heart is racing, my chest is tight, I'm dizzy. And I see all these people in trances and I know I'm going to code and there will be nobody there to help me. I keep snapping in everybody's faces in hopes they will wake up. I'm screaming and crying. \n\nMy boyfriend shows up around this time. I look at him and even HE goes into this trance. I hit him in the chest trying to wake him up. I keep telling him I love him so much and that I'm sorry. I tell him he doesn't have a pulse and I'm so sorry that I've made everybody sick because nobody can help him. There are several nurses and techs and they're trying to hold me down and I'm fighting them. Hard. They try to get an IV but I'm moving too much. They then roll me to the side to give me an IM injection (Benadryl and Ativan). I'm screaming and fighting them because I don't understand what's going on and I think they're giving me something to kill me (because I'm making everybody go into this trance.) I get away from them and get off the stretcher. There are people in and out of the room constantly. They're trying to talk me down. At one point when there is nobody in the room and I sit against the door and try to barricade people from coming in. I manage to get my cell phone and I call 911. I tell them that everybody at my hospital is in a trance and they're trying to kill me. My boyfriend gets the phone from me and is trying his best to calm me down. I keep trying to drag him out of the room (I was trying to get out of the hospital because I thought 911 would be sending EMS). \n\nI start feeling weak and strange. I think that I'm starting to die from the injection they gave me. They're trying to get me back on the stretcher and into wrist restraints. I'm biting and kicking at this point. They try to put paper scrubs on me (I had taken my scrubs off by this point..dunno why). I think they're trying to put a hood over my head so I won't see when they kill me. They give me another injection (Haldol). I'm still trying to get up. Finally all the drugs start hitting me. I'm certain I'm slowly dying at this point. They tell me I've been PEC'd and start explaining things to my boyfriend. I think it's weird that they would bother with a PEC since they tried to kill me. I start feeling very drowsy and weak. They make my boyfriend leave the room since I'm PEC'd. He tells me he'll be back at 1300 for visiting hours. I told him \"Fine, but I'll be dead by then.\" The nurses slowly filter out as it becomes obvious that I won't need to be held down anymore. The leave a sitter in the room that looks terrified. I drifted in and out, at this point I have accepted the fact that I'm going to die and I'm just glad I'm going to be able to sleep. \n\nI sleep a bit on and off and slowly start coming to my senses. I realize I'm not going to die. I start getting scared that I've been PEC'd. My boyfriend comes back and I get him to tell me his side of things. Later that afternoon EMS come to transport me to a psych facility. By that time I'm pretty much back to my baseline. \n\nThe psych facility terrifies me. I'm on a general adult psychiatric ward. The first person to talk to me was a schizophrenic patient that was telling me that I was his daughter and was yelling at me because I took the elevator when he had told me to take the stairs. What in the fuck? I do not belong here. They start me on new meds for sleep (Seroquel). I sleep like a baby and feel fine other then being anxious about being in a psych ward. I think surely they'll let me go home after reviewing the PEC. I'm not a harm to myself or others, I'm not suicidal, I'm not depressed, I'm no hallucinating. Nope. I was there for 9 day. I don't know whether they held me so long because I was a nurse and they wanted to insure I was safe to go back to work. Or maybe because I had good insurance. I saw patients that were in for suicide attempts and active hallucinations leave before me. All medicaid patients. As a nurse, it was definitely enlightening to see this world from a patient side. I now have a very very negative view of short term inpatient psychiatric care. Now this could have been a bad example of typical units. I could write a book. Hell maybe I should.\n\nAnyway. I'm back to work now. Still on nights because I can't find an L&D day position. Thankfully we self scheduled on my unit so I've been able to make sure I don't work more than 3 shifts in a row. The Seroquel is helping with sleep, but I have already had to go up on the dosage for it to be effective. I'm terrified every time I work that I won't be able to sleep. I'm terrified that this will happened again. I never got an official diagnosis but I assume it was a severe panic attack with psychotic features. A small part of me wonders what if this was just a precursor to some psychological illness. All of the nurses on my unit have been so supportive. I still get weirded out at work sometimes, deja vu and what not. I still hate having patients in the room that that labor patient was in. I still feel weird around the nurses that were there that night. It was a terrible experience, I still remember most of it so vividly. The delusion of everybody being in a trance still seems so so realistic to me. I've talked to so many people about how it looked from an outside perspective. I wish I could understand exactly what happened. It's awful to have your mind betray you.\n\nThank you for anybody that read. It feels good to see all of this down in black and white. And please, take my experience as a warning. You are not invincible. You can not keep running your body into the ground. One day your body and mind will say \"Enough.\"",

    "text": "This is illegal, right? So I work in dialysis... this is a big-money field dominated by for-profit companies.  The company I work for is very numbers-oriented, which means that they are more interested in looking good than actually having good outcomes for patients.  Somehow this equates with getting more money from Medicare.  I don't know shit about this, and I don't care.\n\nThe current thing they are pushing:  Before the patient goes on dialysis, they weigh in.  We see how much weight they have gained between treatments (from not peeing out the fluid they take in), and we program the machine to remove fluid to get them to a \"goal weight\" or \"dry weight.\"  The dry weight is determined by the physician or NP as part of the patient's prescribed treatment.\n\nFor a few months now, management (i.e. non-clinical people) have been telling me that I need to change the patient's goal weight every day, so they come off treatment at their goal weight 100% of the time.  Four of the five docs I work with have asked me not to do this.  They want to prescribe the goal weight for their patients, which is fine with me.  I'm not a doctor, it's not my job to make this shit up.  The patients are seen once a week by their doc or NP, so there is plenty of opportunity to change goal weights when the patient is legitimately gaining or losing weight.\n\nToday I got an email from my boss saying \"You WILL start doing this by the end of the month.\"  The thing is, no, I will not start doing that.  Last time I checked, I'm a nurse, and I don't get to change physician orders without, well.... an order from a physician.\n\nWhen a patient is unable to reach their goal weight in a single dialysis treatment, it's likely because they drank too much and are fluid overloaded.  The docs want us to remove as much fluid as we can safely take off, and if it takes a week to get them to goal weight, so be it.  I tend to agree with this, since it is more likely to actually keep the patient healthy and out of the hospital.\n\nChanging weights from day to day just to make numbers look good makes no sense to me.  The docs and NPs are irate.  I have great relationships with them, and I showed the email to one of the NPs.  They do NOT want me changing orders.  I have been told that I \"need to educate these doctors.\"  Then I laughed so hard I almost fell off my unicorn.  My boss says that if I'm not comfortable talking to the docs about this, she will talk to them. Be my guest, I say.  I've had 4 bosses in the last year.  I have talked to the docs about it, and I heard what they had to say, and I agree with them.  The company is proposing a practice that is not good for patient outcomes, and it also violates my scope of practice.  I love my docs and they trust me; I have never felt so respected by physicians as I have by my nephrologists.  I refuse to do something they have explicitly said they don't want me to do.\n\nSo is there any recourse for nurses in this situation?  Obviously, I am looking for a new job in a new area of nursing, which is a mixed bag of emotions.  There are a lot of other things going on at this job that is making it suck, but asking me to risk my license by violating my scope of practice is the last nail in the coffin.  I'd hate to see other dialysis nurses get in trouble because they don't have the brass balls I have to look my boss in the eye and say no.  Is this something I can ask my state board of nursing about?",

    "text": "New Grad Fired from first Job M.24 and I graduated nursing school in August 2016. I applied for jobs as soon as I graduated, and I applied for my dream Job in the only level one trauma center in state. I had the job actually before I passed boards so the pressure was on to pass boards,  which I did. \n\nI start and everything was so exciting, I saw so much and I precepted with a really resourceful and knowledgeable nurse. The only downside to this was that during my orientation we did mostly administrative things, or we would help out other nurses with tasks like starting an IV or giving a med but we never had patients of our own. But as a new nurse I thought this was the normal orientation for a new nurse at my. I didn't know what I didn't know. \n\n4 days before the end of my orientation with this preceptor we start taking patients,  starting with two and eventually three,  with me of course needing help because this is my first actual week taking patients. \n\nThose 4 days pass and now I'm sent to orient on nights with and experienced but jaded nurse.  He was told that I could handle three patients on my own. And he soon found out that,  that wasnt the case. I then I had to try and play catch up,  because I was expected to know things I weren't taught. Also having to ask the experienced jaded nurse questions became  a shot to my confidence because the response was short and with a hint of annoyance. \n\nThe end of my orientation rolls around and surprise I'm not ready to get off orientation, so my manager decides to add a few more weeks.\n\nDuring those few weeks I learned more, but  the combination of not being able to ask my preceptor as much as I wanted(I would actually ask other nurses to avoid asking him questions)  being a new grad and the basic challenges that come with that, the general isolation from the coworkers ( I was the only male of my race in the entire department), I was not successful. The confidence I came in with dwindled with each passing day,  I felt more and more incompetent as I was expected to do and know things I didn't get a chance to learn first. \n\nSo recently my manager had a meeting with me and decided that this job wasnt a good fit for me.  And I felt it coming all along. Because once my confident was shot,  I didn't move as fast, I wasn't as eager to try new things,  as I was just trying to make it through the shift. I told my manager that I agreed and she assured me she would make sure I found a place that may be better suited for me. \n\nER nursing is the only nursing I ever wanted to do. I've never been drawn to anything else. Now with my confidence crushed, I'm supposed to pick up and look for another job,  interview and explain to the hiring manager why I'm so great for a position, which will most likely be one I really don't want. \n\nI wondered if nursing is for me. Was my experience just horrible and things will be better elsewhere?  Either way I'm at lost for ideas,  because the only thing I wanted I got, but things weren't like I thought they would be when I got there. \n\nAny advice on what to do next, how should I go about this, which steps should I take in continuing my journey, or should I stop here with nursing.",

    "text": "What are some tips for better time management in your unit/specialty? For ER, some I've come to utilize are:\n\nTry to do as much of your charting on your patient as you can at once, especially if you can in the room. If you're triaging a new EMS patient in the room, try to go ahead and do your assessment and chart it as well as any of the miscellaneous protocol charting necessary. In my experience, even though I may do my first assessment then, I may not remember to chart it for hours if I try to do it outside of the room since I often get distracted. Also, try to do as focused an assessment as possible. If your charting system utilizes charting by exception, don't waste time charting assessments that are typically irrelevant for the patient's chief complaint.\n\nIt goes without saying, but try to predict what will be needed. If you can protocol orders, even better. If a woman comes in with abdominal pain, get a urine, IV, and blood ASAP.\n\nPulling meds on multiple patients at once. Obviously this one comes with several stipulations and would likely be frowned upon by the higher ups/regulatory organizations, but can be a pretty big time saver if you're getting your ass kicked. Don't put the meds into the same pocket or container where they can be mixed up, don't take one patient's meds into another pt's room who is on isolation or may be contagious, don't pull controlled substances for multiple patients at once since pharmacy keeps a close eye on controlled dispense vs. administration times.\n\nTry to waste controlled meds at the time of drawing. Having to make an extra trip to the Pyxis just to waste is a bummer and having to return to work because you accidentally went home with a forgotten vial of unwasted controlled substance in your pocket is even worse.\n\nThis may just be me, but I like to prep meds (spiking bags, drawing up vials, mixing, etc.) as much as I can in advance of entering the room. In the room, I'm usually speaking with the patient which can slow down the process of drawing up/prepping meds and make me more distracted/likely to mess something up. I've talked to others who prefer to do it in the room specifically to be able to talk with patients more.\n\nI also ask because I'm interested in more advice on time management myself. I do travel nursing and while some ERs are relatively easy and more relaxed, I also get placement in ERs where I'm running nonstop and always behind.",

    "text": "Can't we all just get along? (Long, and rambling, I apologize) Little bit of a rant, and I'm gonna own that I'm also whining a bit, so bear with me. I'm a cath lab nurse, former ICU, CVICU, & ED. Love, love, love my job! I get to make people happy every day: either we fix em and make em happy, or we get to tell them that their heart is perfect, and make em happy (for the most part, we have a few, very, very few sad endings). And NOTHING feels better than saving a STEMI pt in the middle of the night, and making such a huge difference for them! I wish more nurses would join us, we are always short staffed.  Frankly, I think most nurses are too smart to give up their 3-12s for 4 or 5-10s, plus call ;-) I get it, I really do. And when we do get a new nurse, and get her (or him) trained up, they usually leave to do travel assignments and make buckets of money, because cath labs across the country are short staffed and need travelers, it's a vicious cycle. \n\nI'm on call this weekend, and it never fails: we get called by that one nervous ED doc, and cancelled before we finish parking. No pay for our time traveling, no pay for dropping whatever we're doing at home to zoom into work within 30 minutes (I was in my pj's for 2 of my 3 calls so far this weekend, but I feel like it was a win because I remembered a bra). Again, I get it, that's the job I chose. But often, it feels like we're the unloved step children of the hospital. Or, the cardiologist basically says 'screw it, we're here, let's just do the damned thing', and we're doing a basic cath that could've waited until Monday. It might not be life-threatening, but this patient was labelled as a STEMI, and now the floor is getting nervous that they're going to have a STEMI patient that we refused to cath. Even though it wasn't even a NSTEMI, but instead, a guy going through a cardiac work up last week who got nervous waiting for his diagnostic cath next week and had an anxiety attack.  Ugh. But it's not like we can be mad. That's our job...but not really. \n\nHere's what really chaps my hide: we have been working 5 days a week since last summer, trying desperately to find RNs to replace the 4 who left. We're finally back down to 12 days of call a month, from the 20 we were doing, yay we got a traveler!  We're tired. When we get called in 3 times over the weekend, it's hard not to get frustrated by units who refuse to bring a bed to us for when we're finished, or bring the patient to us if they're in-patient, nurses who refuse to take report when we call, and House Supervisors who insist that we recover the STEMI patient because there are 'no beds'. Like, COME ON PEOPLE! \n\nWhether it's 3 am on a weeknight, or 3 pm on a Sunday, we're alone waaaaayyyy out in the cath lab area. There's just our team, and we don't all arrive at once. We have to set up the room and be ready as soon as the patient arrives, because we have a time limit to meet. 90 minutes, door to balloon, and we've already eaten up however much time it took in the ED or on the floor to get things in motion, 30 minutes getting to the hospital, another 15-20 minutes turning on equipment, setting up the room, calling for a quick report, pulling drugs, mixing meds, and throwing the table. That doesn't really leave time to transport, get the patient switched over to our table, and re-do the ekg/cuff/ETCO2/and defib patches, because it all has to be different so as not to be in the way of the xray/sine pics. At this point, the Dr might only have 20 minutes left to get access and maneuver a guide and wire into a tricky spot and balloon it before the stent goes in. 90 minutes seems like a long time, but it's not, especially when the patient's life is on the line. \n\nAfterwards, we still have to be at work the next day, 7 am as always. Or we go home to be on call for the rest of our overnight or weekend shift. When we get called in at 530 am or pm, I know we might get lucky and finish within 2 hours, and I'm sorry that you're going to change shift at 7, but when I call at 650, please don't refuse report and make me wait until 720. My patient is cold and miserable, the family is anxious, and we just want to go home! We still have to clean and mop the room and get it ready for the next STEMI, and we can't start that until the patient leaves. And the patient can't leave until I give report. I'm a good nurse and I do cate about my patient, but a STEMI is a true emergency, and I probably don't know much. I know that the pt is stable, I can tell you what meds I gave, where his IV is, where his stent is, and maybe his allergies. I will probably have to look to tell you the gauge of the IV, because shit was hitting the fan, and I only cared that the IV worked, I didn't notice the size. I can tell you that he collapsed while waiting to catch the train home, and a police officer who knows good CPR was standing right next to him, and his wife is frantic waiting to see him. That's all I got. That's all I can tell you. I won't take 2 minutes of your time, and I can transport the patient, tuck him in, and take your 1st set of vitals by the time you finish shift change. I'll even go over orders with you, and remind you how to handle a TR band if its been a while. Or, I'll ask the Dr to place a seal in the femoral artery, so you don't have to pull a sheath (and I won't get paged in 4 hours later, because you're too busy to pull it, grrrr).\n\nAnd please don't treat me, or my techs, like we're dumb. The techs in the cath lab aren't \"techs\" in the sense of the word that they're nurse helpers. No, they kinda run the cath lab world. They are highly trained in cardiology, with an RT or XRay degree, plus extra CVT training (Cardio-Vascular Technologist), or they graduated from a CVT school. They can make more money than RNs, lol, and they are often 'in charge' or the manager. They take the same credentialing test as RNs, the RCIS, which gives them the right to circulate patients. They don't do conscious sedation, that's the only difference. They can handle all the drips and meds the ICU deals with. They are ACLS certified. The Dr's rely on them to be an extra set of eyes and hands. In some facilities, they get access in the femoral artery, seal arteries, and pull or place catheters. They may even be allowed to perform most of a diagnostic cath, though that is rare these days, but that's a big ol political thing I won't get into. Just know, they are safe and smart and highly educated. They can run circles around most nurses. They don't \"assist\" me. Techs are my teammates and my equals, with more cardiovascular knowledge in their little fingers than most nurses will ever hope to have (including me, but I'm getting there, lol). And just because I couldn't give you a full head to toe report, please don't roll your eyes. I did my job with what I had. I'm not a bedside nurse anymore, and I often don't have access or time to look for any of the information you need. I think *YOU* are awesome. Please recognize that I'm still one of you, but with an extremely focused job that requires something very different from what you're able to do as a bedside nurse. \n\nSo, long story short: please recognize that while we understand the difficulty of taking a report right at shift change, or the frustration of getting another admission, my job is sometimes 24/7, and I'm ready to go home and eat my dinner 3 hours late, or see my kids, or get 2 hours sleep, before I get called in again.  I don't want to hold a patient, all alone with 1 other nurse, in a recovery area that's shut down and empty for the night or weekend, for any amount of time (yes, I have those bad-ass techs on my team, but they don't count as nurses, they can't monitor a patient after the procedure is over, only *during* a procedure. They have to clock out and leave). I came in and did my job, now I want to clock out and go home, too, before it starts all over again. I swear it's not a dump and run. We know you've got this, please take it from here asap!\n\nI'd really appreciate it if you could find a little empathy for your cath lab brothers and sisters. We don't mean to be grumpy, or pushy. We don't mean to come across as abrasive. We're probably just tired, and feeling a little bit misunderstood, unappreciated, and unloved. And I suppose we make you feel the same way, sometimes, too! As for myself, I'm the nurse who's always smiling and joking with you, because dammit, we're going to make a nursing connection whether you like it or not, and you're going to be my buddy who 'knows me', and knows that I won't ever screw you over, because I was once in your shoes, and I totally get where you're coming from! How the hell do you think I ended up in the cath lab? Became friendly with the cardiologist, one of my favorite people, became *his* go-to post-cath nurse in the ICU, then became the STEMI nurse in the ICU when we went interventional, got bamboozled by the funny, nice cath lab folks, and *boom*, let them lead me down a path straight into the cath lab. Darn them all to heck! And now I'm the CCL educator, getting new nurses from the floor who shadow me every Wednesday. (Don't even get me started on new RNs, I love them so much, getting them on-board the cath lab train, to bridge a greater team work and understanding in the years to come, is so much fun and makes me look forward to Wednesdays!)\n\nIf you're still with me, thank you for hanging in there and letting me vent and blow off a little steam. It probably didn't help that when I tried to call report today, for the 4th time, the day nurse forgot to put me on hold while she and the night nurse complained about the cath lab. I do feel a bit petty, because I was once that nurse, I hate to admit. Always feeling put upon by the specialty areas who just couldn't wait one damned minute (or 40) for me to get settled into my shift! Anyways, please understand that I just needed someone to listen, and not judge too harshly, and I'm keeping this up, though I probably shouldn't because I'm not trying to ruffle any feathers or throw shade (though maybe I did a tiny bit). I want us all to show some mutual respect, is that too much to ask? I'm going to start with me, and say that I know I couldn't do what I do, without the nurses in the ED who start the process and the nurses \"upstairs\" who take over where my job leaves off. Thank you for every time you've taken a cath lab patient, and know that you ARE appreciated for the great job you do!  :-)\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: any patient scenarios are made up or exaggerated to protect identities, obviously ;-)",

    "text": "Dealing with burnout/career dissatisfaction I'm having a huge problem with my current job or career satisfaction.  I'm just burnout out, I guess.  The people I work with know it.  I know it.  I'm anxious about work-related things all the time but at the same time feel detached from situations, I haven't slept well in months and months, and I guess I am getting irritable or difficult to deal with.  So anyone that has experience in this area, how did you fix it?  Change speciality areas?  Leave the profession?  Go back to school and prepare for a new career?  I'm curious about other people's experiences with this type of situation. \n\nA little about my situation: \nI have been a nurse for 15 years, 100% of that time I have worked in a 40 bed mixed ICU environment (MICU/SICU/CVICU). I've been a team lead/charge nurse for about half that time. Now at age 40, I have reached that point in my career where I feel I can't do it anymore.  I can't talk to one more condescending doctor or be hung up on (I've worked night shift the whole time, this is fairly common amongst some of our docs), deal with one more family member that demands something jaw dropping, or more ridiculousness from management. I feel like every year I'm drowning in new RN's that just come in to get their 1 year of experience for CRNA/Travel nursing/move on to day shift.  My stress levels have reached the point to where I was actually hospitalized with chest pain two months ago (completely clear cardiac workup, ruled stress induced angina). \n\nMy review of other options like med/surg, ER, OR, dialysis, etc or changing hospitals just leads me to believe I am going to be walking into the same issues, anxieties, and dissatisfaction.  NP and CRNA paths aren't appealing to me (I feel like my current responsibility level is enough to deal with).  To top it off, I live in decently sized city (600,000+) but undergoing economic depression due to the energy bust and there are not exactly a plethora of career options around, making me feel really trapped into my current situation.",

    "text": "My first code blue - meanwhile my other patient leaves hospital campus with IV access.. help! **I've been an RN for a whopping 9 months. Today I experienced my first code blue and my mind is racing about all the things that I probably (most likely?? totally??) did wrong. I work on a med-surg floor where the ratio is 1:5. Everything happened so fast, I could barely keep up. Please help give your thoughts on what I could've done better..**\n\n**0830** I am talking to my walkie-talkie patient. 56M, admitted yesterday for cirrhosis/ETOH withdrawal. Hx of portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ETOH abuse. My patient tells me he is very nauseated. I get a CIWA score of 11 and go to the pyxis to grab PRN Zofran for nausea and PRN Ativan for the CIWA score. I come back and he told me he just went to the bathroom and vomited bright red blood.  I look in the toilet, it looks to be ~100c. I textpage the MD right away and a few minutes later she arrives. Vital signs are stable. MD puts in new orders for strict NPO, GI consult, IV octreotide & IV protonix infusion. She tells me she thinks he is bleeding from his varices - she looks worried.\n\n**0845** The new med orders are still being verified by pharmacy so I pass meds for my other patient, but I ask my relief nurse to place a second IV on my patient so I can start the IV drips as soon as the new IV is in and the meds are verified. The relief nurse tells me that my patient seems more sleepy. MD tells the relief nurse that she has decided to transfer the patient to stepdown. The relief nurse draws rainbow labs to anticipate whatever labs the MD might order.\n\n**0900** The resource nurse is on our unit to assess my patient and help with the transfer to a higher level of care. While the resource nurse is taking vitals, I start the IV drips. Crash cart is in the room. The patient becomes even more sleepy and harder to arouse. I see a long list of new orders including new orders for T&S (good thing I had rainbow labs) and PRBC transfusion.\n\n**0930** The patient suddenly has a HUGE volume projectile bright red blood emesis, maybe half a liter or more all over the floor. We suction the patient, put him on oxymask, and call an RRT (rapid response team) which immediately got upgraded to a Code Blue (despite patient still breathing/heart still beating) due to likely possibility of intubation. Once the Code Blue was started it was chaos, so many people were in the room, we were moving other patients' beds out of the room (it was a 4-patient room). I felt so helpless and incompetent so I was just running up and down the hall grabbing supplies (NS bolus, soft restraints for the intubation, preparing tubing for o-neg blood, etc). I called ICU to give report. **It was very busy but by 1015 the patient was intubated and on the way to ICU.**\n\n---\n**MEANWHILE, HERE'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH MY OTHER PATIENT!** After the Code Blue, I learn that my other patient had left the hospital with his IV in. Patient has history of meth abuse. No one had informed me that he had left until AFTER he was gone.\n\nHere's the story behind that: the day before, the social worker and doctor told me the plan is that he will have a 1-hour pass to go to the county jail to pick up some documents in person to verify he was incarcerated in order to collect SSI. I told my assistant nurse manager this, she straight up said no to this plan because it was against hospital policy to let patients leave like that. I passed this information onto the doctor and the social worker as well as the next shift nurse to have them follow up with that.\n\nI come into work the next day and that's still the plan. And since it's the weekend, the ANM is not on the unit. The charge nurse for the day says it's ok and the doctor is adamant in the plan. I once again tell the doctor that it's not okay with the ANM, so he tells me \"Ok so I will officially discharge the patient so he can get the documents and then he can come back through the ED to get admitted again.\" 15 minutes later the doctor tells me he's gone back to the original plan and as I protest he says \"Shh - let's not talk about it.\" The charge nurse ok's the plan and transportation (from an outside agency) is made for the patient to be picked up at 1000. Meanwhile my other patient is declining rapidly (this is just a few minutes before the Code Blue starts) and I don't protest anymore so I can attend to declining patient.\n\nThen the Code Blue happens. It's over at 1015. Someone tells me, \"Hey, your patient left with transportation to the county jail.\" I freak out - I was so caught up in the Code Blue that I did not remove his IV. I let the charge nurse know, and the charge nurse seems chill about this, saying \"The transport guy will keep an eye on him, he deals with transporting difficult patients all the time.\" The patient returns at 1100, vital signs are stable, IV still patent, and he doesn't look like he's under the influence of any drugs.\n\n**Anyway. I'm sorry if this is all word vomit. I just need to know your thoughts. I'm freaking out. I come back to work on Monday and most likely my ANM will find out what happened over the weekend and I'm preparing to write my incident report.**",

    "text": "Why can't I find a unit that works for me? TL; DR: Worked multiple units/hospitals/states since becoming a nurse over 3 years ago and can't seem to find my niche. What am I missing here?\n\nDR: Hey guys, regular here under a throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been an RN for over three years now and for the most part, I like my job. I work in PICU and peds and have since before school. I started off ICU and left my first job after 9 months because of toxic bitchy coworkers who talked smack about anyone outside their circle. Rest of the unit and acuity was great, but as a new grad in a stressful environment, I did not feel supported at all by my more experienced coworkers or management.\n\nWent from that job to 1 yr of primary care which was great except the clinic I worked at had never had a peds nurse and I didn't know wtf I was supposed to be doing and neither it seemed did the pediatricians. From there, went back to a small inpatient peds ward for another 1 year and constantly took care of post op OB patients which was interesting but not my forte. Changed states and did a slightly larger peds ward in an adult hospital, took up travel nursing 4 months later and did one 4 month assignment in gen peds before landing in what I hoped was gonna be my dream unit, back in a PICU. \n\nI've been at this place for almost a year now and dislike it a lot. The acuity is really mixed (traditional sick PICU kids and more step down/chronic kids alike), and I came in with experience yet seem to be getting the most boring, unchallenging patients day in and day out, despite emailing my primary charge and complaining to other charge nurses and my educator, all who say they'll work to get my higher acuity assignments, yet never do. I've asked multiple coworkers and management if my skills were prohibiting me from taking more complex assignments and everyone assures me that's not the case, yet the same people---new grads with less experience than I do--are taking more complex kids than me.\n\nNot only that, but the people on this unit, while polite are extremely distant and not really interested in becoming friendly with newer staff. This doesn't bother me as much; I seem to get along well with travelers, but those guys aren't going to be there forever.\n\nI am so fed up with changing hospitals and jobs but just can't seem to catch a break with any place that I get accepted at. Is/has anyone else experienced this or am I just looking for grass that's supposedly greener on the other side? \n\nThanks for reading!",

I am very excited but also pretty nervous as it is a much different type of nursing than I'm used to. I do very much look forward to the change of pace however--I have started to find myself getting bored with the monotony and predictability of med/surg nursing and I wanted to be proactive in switching up the scenery before my work ethic goes down from boredom. Would love to hear about other RN's transitions to ER from other specialties and what would be useful to know before I delve in! I am being a sponge for the next few months, I do not want to let any habits get in the way of me learning a new way of nursing.\n\nAlso, for those of you who left MED surg nursing for the ER, did you get flak from your coworkers about leaving? It seems I got mixed reactions from my coworkers. Some seemed upset that I'm leaving the floor, others seemed skeptical, superficially portraying support but then making it seem like I couldn't handle the faster pace or something. Oh well, haters gonna hate. At least my manager was fully supportive of me leaving.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

I've been told to arrange my desks in rows to start to establish order, and I've been told to arrange my desks in groups to establish the expectation that students are going to collaborate regularly.\n\nMy question is how does everyone begin their first days and continue through the first week, especially middle school teachers? I know a lot is based on school expectations and personal style, but I just want to get some opinions from others for me to consider as I continue to plan!\n\nEdit: I wanted to go ahead and add I've read The First Days of School and Tools for Teaching, but I want to get additional perspectives and suggestions from other professionals! 😊",

    "text": "[Inner city] [US History/8th grade] - Black vs African-American? I'm white. For the past four years, I've been teaching 8th grade in a school where 90% of the students are black. I've only taught ELA, but when something comes up regarding race and I say \"black\", someone will cheekily say \"it's AFRICAN-AMERICAN!\", or when I say \"African-American,\" someone will cheekily say \"Just say BLACK, I'm not from Africa!\"\n\nIn reality, I just mix it up based on what sounds better in the given sentence. I probably say \"black\" more because African-American is hard to say with a lot of syllables. But I have some sensitive students that take themselves pretty seriously, so I'm trying to avoid angry parent phone calls this year.\n\nThis is my first time teaching U.S. history so race is going to come up a lot. I want to explain from the start what I just said here, but I really have no right to tell them \"You shouldn't be offended by black!\" or \"Most of you aren't even from Africa, so I'm not using African-American!\"\n\nAny advice? Should I just accept there will be complaints either way and ignore them like I do with most petty complaints?\n\nOther info if it matters:\n\n* In a major northeast city\n\n* Most teachers are white\n\n* Right on the border of a very white neighborhood, so most kids are pretty racially desensitized\n\n* About two kids a year will angrily call me a cracker, so racism is still there a bit",

    "text": "Update to \"I think I'm in over my head\". So 6 months ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4xx4ac/i_think_im_in_over_my_head/\n\nHere's a summary of my first semester in my district's alternative program:\n\nWe were 4 teachers: 3 alternative certification (no teacher training or experience) and 1 long term sub. We also had one first year Behavior Management Specialist.\n\nWe had up to 75 students. These kids are in 6-12. They come to our program for 45-180 days after expulsion hearings or when they're released from the Department of Juvenile Justice. Some are the real deal, with violent criminals history, gang affiliation, fights in school and on the bus, and they're frequently in and out of jail. Some were caught with drugs in school (weed or xanax). Some just had too many office referrals. A few have IEPs, but most are unmedicated and their IEPs are only loosely followed at best. Many more have undiagnosed LDs. Only a handful come from decent homes. \n\nThe vast majority of them are loud and uninterested in school, but most are decent, respectful kids if you treat them like human beings. Some will curse you out, but I really like almost all of them. \n\nSo they end up with us for one reason or another. And we're supposed to run a very strict, structured, highly restrictive, punitive program. It's supposed to scare them straight. It's supposed to feel like jail. We have 4 blocks, 4 teachers, and 4  mixed classes. One middle school, one mixed middle and high, and two high school, all with kids in different classes.\n\nMy certification is for MS Social Studies and History and HS History (NOT Social Studies). I have students who are supposed to be doing everything from US History and Constitution to 7th grade World History. If they're actually assigned a social studies class. Many are supposed to be working on things like Health, ROTC, Spanish, Economics, Marketing, Law Education, Art, and Earth Science in my class. I don't speak Spanish. I'm not certified to teach any of those things. Even if I just follow the curriculum, I have 16 other kids in other classes I'm supposed to be teaching at the same time. Even when I have a couple kids in the same class, they're in vastly different places in the curriculum.\n\nThe kids all have tablets. They're supposed to work on Edgenuity, which aligns with the classes in their home schools and should keep them on track if they're self-motivated enough to keep up. None of them are. It's a boring, unengaging, tedious program that shows videos, asks questions, and then quizzes them. Endlessly. They do this in all 4 blocks every day, with a 20 minute break for lunch.\n\nThe principal says to do enrichment, too. Blended learning, she says. But I can't expect my social studies kids to be cool with a whole bunch of extra work that I'm not qualified to give to the Spanish kids. And I can't give enrichment that doesn't directly relate to the Edgenuity lesson each kid is currently doing. I can't take away from the time they could be completing their Edgenuity if I can't offer a direct substitute for the lesson. And I can't do that.\n\nSo we expect these kids to sit from 9 to 3. And I mean sit. They are not to get up. They are not offered any activity ever (which goes really well for the 7th graders). They are not to use their tablets for anything else, ever. They are **absolutely not allowed to listen to music, ever**. They have no freedom to move at all. They must be accompanied to the bathroom in twos, so I can't just take the whole class. They are not allowed water bottles, and cannot get water on their own.\n\nUltimately, it's a huge academic setback. The kids with minor behavior issues end up getting worse, and the kids with serious behavior issues don't get any better.\n\nThen there's our admin. Remember that were three first year alternative certification teachers, a LTS, and a first year BMS. We are very isolated, even from our principal. She's on the other side of the building, through the district office. Our AP was about 45 months pregnant all of last semester, and spent most of her time on the other side with the principal. This left us alone. Very, very alone. We do not do searches. Kids can't bring backpacks, but we don't search and there's no metal detector. Oh, we're also the only school in the district without a resource officer.\n\nWe were having discipline issues (surprise). Principal told us it was because we weren't doing enough, weren't doing our jobs, and she wouldn't do disciplinary stuff until we did. Ha.\n\nWe would call for help, and it would take 10 minutes, minimum, for someone to come help us. If the kids attacked a teacher and took over the class, nobody would know for at least 40 minutes, and up to 2 hours. Even then, what's our very pregnant AP going to do?\n\nWe've never had a fire drill. My room has only 1 door and no windows.\n\nOur SPED teacher is often off campus at the vocational school (which is attended by only the most hopeless students). This leaves IEP kids with IEPs that aren't being followed.\n\nWe've begged for PE. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a resource officer. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for radios. Nothing.\n\nWe've begged for a planning period. Nothing.\n\nThis program is a disgrace. It's a holding tank for the kids the district doesn't want on their expulsion record but doesn't want in real classes. They're waiting for these kids to drop out or get locked up. It's cruel and horrible, and I'm putting in for a transfer.\n\nBut I love the kids, and I love my co-workers, and I know I'm going to love a real classroom.\n\nSo that's it. It's awful, but not because of the kids, and not because of me.",

    "text": "[Southern USA] [Kindergarten] - Please help with class management! Throwaway account, because I'm paranoid of someone in my school finding me. Also posted in /r/ECEProfessionals \n\nI am a second-year teacher at a rural, 90% African American school in the southern United States. I'm having issues with classroom management. Last year, my assistant was very strong- she basically ran my whole classroom. Whenever the kids were being too loud, she'd sternly redirect them to pay attention. Sometimes she even yelled, but it worked. I am not a confrontational person and her methods worked, so I ran with it. She was African American, and told me that her ways were effective because the kids saw her as a mom/grandma figure and respected her. I believe this to be true. However, she has retired and I have a new assistant- an older white lady who is not as strong of a personality.\n\nIn this community, the norm is for children to be scolded/punished for doing wrong things. The ways that some of the other teachers talk to their students align to this method of child-rearing, because culturally they are similar to their students (again, the kids see the teacher as a mom/grandma). I should mention here that I am white. I have been told by the other kinder teacher (and several other friends within the school) that if I spoke to the kids the way the other teachers might, I would be in trouble because \"Black people don't want to see their kids yelled at by a white teacher\". That is a direct quote, please don't call me a racist or tell me that race doesn't matter.\n\nThe issue is that I cannot get the kids to stay quiet or pay attention, even if I raise my voice (which I hate to do). I also feel like they are goofing off when we are supposed to be working. My kids are turning in absolute crap- I know they are capable of better work. When I try to get them to be quiet, they still talk or play at their tables and do half-assed work. I would love to be able to allow them to whisper at their tables about what we are doing (and generally work together in teams), but it seems like the majority of them are always off-task. I try to plan active activities/group work/movement into our day. I also allow them to talk during breakfast and snack.\n\nWe have a school-wide management system using a 'green, yellow, red' behavior chart. If a kid misbehaves, I'll warn them. If they repeat, I'll change their color. I've thought about starting some kind of token-based economy, but at this point I'm not sure they'd be quiet or attentive long enough for me to tell them about it.\nI've tried all the positive behavior things we learn in college, like highlighting kids that are doing what is expected, etc. We made our class rules together. All the positive/reinforcing/'let's talk about your choices' stuff doesn't work. Changing their colors doesn't work. Having them practice walking in the hallway quietly (because we can't seem to do that correctly, either) doesn't work. None of it seems to work. I'm frustrated and upset and not sure what else to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Starting my 2nd year teaching English at an alternative school. Very anxious. Any advice? At the end of the month I will begin my 2nd year teaching English at an alternative school. The students I teach all have behavioral issues and most are on IEPs. My first year was a bit of a mixed bag in terms of my performance. I felt for the first three quarters of the year I did a somewhat decent job with classroom management and felt very comfortable with the curriculum. The last quarter was incredibly difficult for me as the students began to take advantage of my cool, calm, collected approach and while I do place some blame on myself, the school was incredibly unhelpful as just about every time I needed to send a student out of my classroom no one was around to A) receive my call or B) receive the student that needed to be removed. Eventually I had two physical incidents between students in my classroom very late in the school year. As a result I was called in for a meeting with some of the higher ups in my school/ program during the final week of the school year and was told I would be placed on a 60 day classroom management program where my progress would be evaluated. The details of which were painfully vague. I was also told that if I felt that this position wasn't for me that it would be a good idea to \"see what else is out there.\" I thought this decision was completely unjustified and the comment about seeing what else might be out there was very insulting. In fact I did see what other jobs were out there, specifically something in a regular school district, but my search hasn't yielded results. You can see why I might be a little anxious heading into this 2nd year.\n\nSome things that I have been doing so far this summer include reading The First Days of School by Harry Wong and Never Work Harder Than Your Students by Robyn Jackson. I'm really trying to focus on having a clean year in terms of classroom management. My goal by the end of this year is to be completely confident in my management style and successfully implementing the curriculum in my classroom. I'm looking for some general advice from other teachers in terms of classroom management and lesson plan ideas/ resources. I'm not so much anxious about the start of the year as I am about later in the year when the number of students we have at our school starts to get very high usually after winter break. I should also mention that I teach grades 6-12, though our number of middle schoolers seems to increase greatly with each year. I ran into trouble last year trying to balance what material to teach to what grades considering having separate lesson plans for my middle school classes, grade 9, 10, 11, and 12 can be very daunting when I'm doing something different with each class.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to any advice you can give!",

Throwaway because current coworkers know my reddit username.\nI am one year removed from graduating from a state university with a major in Marketing and a minor in Computer science. Internship experience during school focused mainly on IT with some marketing mixed in.\n\nCurrently, I am in a sales role at a marketing technology company in Boston. I make good money for what I do ($50k base), but it's not enough to make up for the dread I experience every morning waking up to go to work. This is going to be a bit of a vent session, so bear with me, lol:\n\nI love the company I'm with. Everyone I work with is intelligent and helpful and the product we make, although nearly impossible to sell, is interesting and useful.\n\nThat being said, I fucking hate sales, so, so, much. I can't stand how mind numbing prospecting is. I can't stand how even if I'm so very fortunate to get on someone's calendar, I'm always just the \"sales guy\". My time is never valued externally. Our sales cycle is 6-12 months. This creates an environment with very little gratification and constant head-banging.\n\nI am a person who likes to create, I like to DO things. I like to be busy. This may be pompous but I genuinely believe I'm too skilled and smart to be drafting 50 emails a day to people who couldn't be bothered to read them. Or reciting the same damn sales pitch every time I do get a meeting.\n\nWhen I want to get something tangible done, like when I'm modifying my car, or writing an essay, or even just cleaning my house, I work with passion and typically have and end result I can look at and be proud of. I can't stand coming into work, sending a myriad of emails, maybe taking a meeting or two, and having nothing to show for it.\n\nI feel my brain isn't being worked and I'm not learning new things, so I've been looking into moving on. While the idea of moving on excites me greatly, I have found it more difficult than expected to answer the question of \"so you've just worked a job you hate for a year, what would be a job that you would LIKE?\".\n\nThis paragraph should be where I go into a bit about myself: I'm a tinkerer, a creator, a builder. I like to get dirty and do the irregular and solve problems. I wanted to be an engineer but was never good enough at the math. Then I wanted to be a computer scientist but programming just didn't come naturally to me. I fell into marketing and came to genuinely enjoy analyzing and solving business problems.\n\nWhen I graduated, a marketing position seemed natural. But in Boston with a state school degree in town of Harvard, MIT, and the like, I found it near-impossible to land a decent entry-level marketing/advertising gig, so I settled for sales.\n\nI've learned valuable things about marketing technology, but the field, and sales, are something I could never be passionate about. I enjoy, and am good at, talking to people, but I just don't solve problems like I did in school. My brain feels like it's turning to mush.\n\nI've looked at business analyst roles, although those are very competitive. The same can be said about the marketing coordinator roles I've applied for. I hold out hope but need other options. I am passionate about renewable energy, the outdoors, sports, anything with an engine, writing, and fixing things. I'm hoping you were a saint enough to read down to here and give me some advice on some roles I should be on the lookout for that will allow me to have a more gratifying and impactful career, all while managing to still pay my rent every month.\n\nBoston is booming right now, and I'm hopeful because the opportunities are boundless. But that is both a blessing and an overwhelming curse. Do you have any recommendations for things I should be typing in that LinkedIn/Indeed search bar?",

I'm getting ready to graduate with a degree in engineering, and I've been pretty unhappy with it, so I've been looking for something else. I finally found a common theme in some of my hobbies/childhood interests and thought I'd see if anyone could help connect the dots and suggest some related career paths:\n\n1. When I was younger, I really wanted to own and manage a horse racing stable. The two things I liked most about it were the horses (I love animals) and the \"operations\" side of it. I like the idea of managing the schedules of the horses, training plans, travelling, etc.\n\n2. I play this computer game called \"Football Manager\" pretty avidly. (Google it if you aren't familiar with it, but it's a fairly realistic soccer-managing game.) I enjoy the spreadsheets, the data, managing/tracking players throughout their careers, etc.\n\n3. In the sports I play now, I'm not the best player, but I'm good at leading and almost coaching my teammates. I like helping others succeed like that.\n\n4. I really like the idea of being a small (or large) business owner someday. Just haven't figured out the field.\n\n5. I'm a very active person. I can't sit at a desk all day, but I also don't want to be in a manual labor position all day everyday. I'd like a career where every day looks a little different and there's a decent balance of teamwork, independent work, hands on, paper work, etc.\n\n6. I fully recognize that jobs almost always require sacrificing some of our \"wants\" and I'm definitely willing to do that.\n\nYeah, I don't know how helpful that is. I can answer questions that might help. Thanks for reading!",

    "text": "I think my boss is a fucking idiot and I'm not sure what to do Throwaway because my friends know my real account.\n\nAnyway, I started working for this company 3 years ago, when I first started working there I had a really nice and intelligent boss who taught me a lot. He taught me that coding style matters and there is much more to programming than just having a working binary at the end of the day. For reference, I was mostly just doing embedded C, C++, and a bit of python. \n\nHowever after a while I got bored of doing the same thing everyday, so a few months ago I switched teams. The new team was doing cloud development and I thought it would be an interesting area to get into. Shortly after I joined, the manager of the team left to be a manager for a different department at my company. My company has extremely low employee turnover, they generally try their hardest to keep everyone (and they also pay incredibly).\n\nThe new manager was the senior developer on the team and basically started the project as a demo a year ago. He basically wrote about 80% of the code, my company hired a few other developers 5 months ago, and I switched teams 2 months ago. Here's the lowdown on the project:\n\n* The majority of the code is written in Java, which is good in my opinion.\n* About 20% of the code is written in bash, mostly all the configuration parsing and deployment logic, basically everything that is not Java is bash (less than  5% of the code is non-bash and non-java). \n* Almost every variable in bash is exported meaning basically every variable is global and the code cannot be made modular at all.\n* There is absolutely no coding style, almost every file is mixed between spaces and tabs. The bash scripts and yaml files tend to be 2 spaces, java tends to be 4 spaces and tabs mixed. The other files (perl, python, ruby) seem to be mostly 4 spaces, but depends on who wrote them.\n* I asked my boss about coding standards during our daily meetings and he said we're supposed to be 4 spaces, but he continually commits files with tabs.\n* We have a bunch of junit tests which we manually run for integration/regression testing (which is good in my opinion).\n* He refuses to set up automated testing using those junit tests because he thinks it will take too long to setup. As a result I have to spend a few hours everyday figuring out who broke the build.\n* The automated tests routinely fail for no apparent reason and I blame that entirely on his reluctance to actually fix anything. If he is able to run the tests several times and they all pass at least once each, then he considers that to be a good load, despite having various tests routinely fail.\n* The other developers routinely commit stuff without testing all the cases and which sometimes breaks my workflow, but I feel this could be fixed with automated testing and better infrastructure.\n* He merges stuff without testing it, which results in everything being broken all the time\n* He gets mad at me for not knowing stuff despite nobody having given me the knowledge beforehand. My other coworkers generally don't know enough to be of any use in most cases.\n* He has occasionally commit files after merging that are only partially merged (literally full of >>>>> ====== <<<<<), and therefore unusable.\n* He was surprised when one of the bash input parameters, that was input as \"var=$VARIABLE_NAME\" came out as \"var=\" (I'll give you a hint, he doesn't know how to escape in bash properly).\n* He doesn't know how to write generic code, which results in him copying and pasting the same function about 20 times with slight differences.\n* He uses tons of magic numbers, never uses final (which is the java equivalent of const), never comments and rarely documents, uses strings for things that could be enums, and uses way too many public functions (in my opinion)\n* He thinks I waste too much time reading documentation and constantly gets mad at me for it. (maybe I spend 15% of my time reading documentation despite being new)\n* He doesn't like it when we try to improve our internal tools, since we don't sell those tools to customers and therefore they aren't worth making very good\n* As a result, our internal tools suck and constantly break which results in large amounts of wasted time. They also aren't remotely helpful if you do something slightly wrong (such as forget or misspell a parameter) which occasionally means digging through log files to figure out what you did wrong.\n* None of the internal tools have sane defaults, and to work they generally require all of: setting environment variables, changing a configuration file, and passing command line arguments\n* Whenever he runs into any timing issue he can't solve within a few minutes, he adds a bunch of sleeps. This results in everything taking forever and occasionally still not working because he didn't  actually fix the underlying problem.\n* He easily works 80 hour weeks (because he works nights and weekends) and I feel he resents us for not working as \"hard\" as him\n* His variable and function names are mixed between snake case (function_that_does_work) and camel case (functionThatDoesWork), even in the same file.\n* He \"checks up on me\" multiple times a day (and probably my coworkers too) which results in me feeling anxious all the time because he low-key guilt trips me about not working as much as him.\n* He constantly rushes us, despite us being ahead of schedule as far as I'm aware\n* Everyone else on the team works from home several times a week, probably to get away from him.\n* He constantly says the phrase \"time to market\" as if it will summon the god of capitalism or something\n* He admits there are problems but says we can fix them later, which results in me thinking he just loves technical debt since there is absolutely no plan to fix any of the issues.\n\nI'm not sure what to do. Should I talk to his manager about how horrible he is, or just find a new job? Or am I just a big whiner?\n\nIt's worth mentioning I've only had great bosses before this guy, maybe that's spoiled my opinion of software development management.\n\nMore minor things:\n\n* He touches my screen all the time despite me asking him not to\n* He points at my screen and says \"SEE WHAT THIS DOES\" despite me not being able to see because his hand is in the way\n* He gets mad because I can't read the code since his hand is in the way (no I'm not kidding).\n\nI think he's way too tired and he doesn't realize other people have a different perspective than him (literally and figuratively).",

    "text": "About to be an engineering manager at a young age. Any advice for me? Hi,\n\nBrief overview: been working in the SF Bay Area at various software companies for the last 5 years (started and finished university early). Currently a software engineer a private company with hundreds of employees that's growing fast.\n\nLong story short, been at this company a few years, I'm not an genius programmer but a good enough software engineer, good enough to deliver a few successful projects/products on time and with high quality. Built good rapport with everybody and my manager is telling me that he wants to move me into a management position. I'd have more than 5 reports (basically other engineers who had been my peers), possibly upwards of 10.\n\nI'm kind of overwhelmed because this would be my first management role, and especially because almost all my reports will be older and more experienced than me (though I have been at this company longer). Some of them have even been engineering managers themselves. We're all on good terms, and I have their respect now as a \"tech lead\", but still I feel intimidated.\n\nAny advice for me? Pitfalls to avoid?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the comments and advice. This role will probably be a mix of managing people and tech, and still doing some coding. Will definitely make an update in the future, hopefully it's a mundane one (things going well, nothing much to report).",

    "text": "My experience interning at a proprietary trading firm this summer This summer I interned at a pretty good (in my opinion) prop shop in the trading division. I'm a CS major at a decent school. Currently a rising junior. Won't say which firm for privacy reasons.\n\n**disclaimer: the thoughts below are based on my isolated experience at ONE trading firm this summer, and from talking to traders/upper management at the company **\n\n**Overall Experience**\n\nThe internship program at any good trading firm should have some mix of learning, trading, and side projects. We spent a few weeks sitting in a class room learning theory, products that the firm trades, mock trading, etc. As the teaching winded down, we got assigned projects for different desks to work on. Being a CS major I requested a more programming-focused project. Finally, we traded live on the market (CFTC, no Series 57 required).\n\n**Thoughts about the industry**\n\nTrading isn't for the feint of heart. The stuff I heard about high-pressure and getting fired if you fuck up are true based on my experience here. Even as interns we were constantly watched and assessed and criticized for getting things wrong. There was a day when one of the newer hires messed up and lost the firm quite a bit of money. It's an open office so you can hear across desks. I remember the head of the group that guy was in was going off on him. The next day he was gone. To be fair, the guy actually lost quite a bit of money. But to be chilling one day and then not have a job the next is pretty crazy - i don't think you see that much in the CS industry.\n\nIf you're good, you'll make lots of money. The firm I am at this summer pays very well. The first year comp is MUCH higher than the numbers posted on Glassdoor. The all-in comp for a first-year trader excluding performance bonuses is greater than the ones I've seen at any big-4 (except maybe the higher FB ones that the return interns get). If you are a high-performer, your all-in comp easily exceeds 200K+. What surprised me the most was how high the base salary was. I thought the base salary would be <100K but was surprised when I was told it  was well above that. (I didn't intern at jane street for those wondering)\n\nSome of the senior guys are making upwards of 500K to 1M per year. Keep in mind volatility has been extraordinarily low for the last year; apparently you make 2-3x more when the market goes to shit. Going to a trading firm during a recession is a gold mine because the firm makes so much more money.\n\nThe hours aren't bad either. As an intern I never worked more than 12 hours in a day, with the average being ~8.5 to 9 hours. Most traders also work pretty normal hours - you trade when the market is open, work on projects/chill after it closes, and leave. Some traders literally work 6 hours a day and fuck around the rest. If you're profitable no one cares how much you work, and you make a boatload of money with it.\n\n**thoughts about trading**\n\nYou might be wondering how you can get into this industry. To prepare for interviews I'd suggest getting really good at mental math, probability, pattern recognition, and brain teasers. Practice on arithmetic.zetamac.com and tradertest.org. I was surprised how much mental math you actually use on the job; if you get tested on that during the interview there's a good reason for it. Keep in mind this is for discretionary trading. Algorithmic and quant trading are different and require more programming and math skills.\n\nI'm happy to answer questions people might have - I know there's not a lot of information out there about prop trading.",

    "text": "Currently an SDET in training, getting paid extremely well. Worth it to quit and train to be an SDE? I've been working at a big software company for a few years now. PM type work, with a little QA mixed in. I'm getting paid ~150k after all is said and done.\n\nI've been interested in coding for a while and taught myself all the basics over the last 2 years or so. I expressed this interest to my manager, and since I already had background in our QA processes, he said I could take the open SDET position that recently became available. I took it, and maintained my current salary. I've been training/transitioning for the last month or so.\n\nFrom speaking to SDE friends at other companies, it seems like the SDET role, either in general or just at my company, kind of sucks in comparison. The training i've been getting is poor/non-existent. I've had to research everything myself, and it seems like SDET material is much more sparse than SDE material. I've been told that StackOverflow can answer almost any question I have, and if not it will be in some blog. Well I've been searching for questions related to the automation work i have to do, and there are often just no results. It's made it incredibly hard to learn.\n\nThe work itself also seems much less interesting. I really enjoy testing things, but the vast majority of work i've done is researching libraries/frameworks and setting them up. Coding the actual tests has been pretty straightforward and took much much less time than anything else. As an SDET, I hop around from project to project setting everything up. From what i've heard, in the SDE world this isn't the case until you get much higher up. My friends have said that for the first few years of work they spent the majority of their time coding, as the frameworks/libraries were chosen/setup by someone more senior, or just years ago before they started working on their project, since they tend to stick with a single project instead of hopping around.\n\nIf what i've heard is true, I think an SDE position is more interesting than an SDET role. The problem is, I have no idea how I would change. I could quit my job, take some classes/self study and find a new one, but i'd be going into it as a junior and would expect a 50% paycut. That's pretty steep. I could see about transferring internally, but the problems with that:\n\n* I just started transitioning to SDET. I think this would cause a lot of tension, since I already left my previous team to become an SDET which ruffled some feathers already. Trying to leave again would definitely cause some issues.\n* I have QA experience, but nothing relevant to an SDE role. I don't think I could pass the internal interview. I would need to spend time studying after work, but I don't have any time for that. I could push and find a little time, but it would take probably a year to learn enough to pass the interview (our SDE interviews are pretty tough, and they don't go much easier when doing so internally)\n\n\nI don't really know what advice i'm looking for specifically, but i'm hoping some people here have some for me. Are my assumptions about the differences between SDE and SDET correct? If so, what's the best way to transition to an SDE? Do I just need to suck it up and take a 50% pay cut?",

They can afford to stay up to 8-9pm and come back to work next day by 8am. They don't have kids, and if you got one, you're screwed. You have to compete with those, who have no obligations, who are crazy enough in their 20-25 to stay and work for long hours.\n\nIt's totally unhealthy for them, but seems like managers like it (of course they do).

I make $12/hr and work 20 hrs/wk, and I'm the only person in my department, which is a mix of marketing, graphic design, and web development (front and back end).*\n\n*I have a direct supervisor (in charge of all the interns, I'll call them B), an indirect supervisor (is an intern but gets paid more, works more, and has more responsibilities than the rest of us, I'll call them C), and the senior VP of the company (I'll call them A).*\n\nContinuing on that, I've just been assigned with redesigning the company website, strictly front end. After digging around the existing website, however, I managed to talk the company into getting a completely new website, front and back end (to be fair, the previous website was awful and I wasn't going to be able to make any changes to it). Shortly after this assignment, A left on business, and will be gone for two more weeks. Starting on this assignment, I've realized it's a lot more work than I thought. I wouldn't say I'm in over head, but it's far from $12/hr work.\n\nI have a couple of options at this point:\n\n* Ask for a raise. After speaking with C, he told me he asked for a raise when he took on more responsibilities, and was bumped to $15/hr, 30 hrs/wk. This is nice, and being a college intern I can't complain about $15/hr, but I feel it's not enough for the work I'm doing.\n    * I would have to wait until A gets back, meaning I would either do nothing for two weeks or do two weeks of underpaid work.\n    * If needed, I could probably bring an ultimatum to the table, but I enjoy working for the company and would rather not be a dick.\n    * Also, if needed, I could do the underpaid work and keep the site hostage, only offering to give them the work if I got the raise. Huge dick move though.\n* Ask for help. B is in charge of hiring new interns, and all it would take is my asking/recommendation to get more people in my department. Since this is an internship though, the coworkers I'd get would be college kids, and I think they may not be able to help as much as I'd like.\n* Reject the project? Not sure how happy people would be about that, but I'm an intern, and I think this is way above intern work.\n* Leave. Bad choice, not gonna happen, but it's an option, and there are other companies that are hiring that would hire me.\n\nOn top of all of that, C's put in their notice, and is in the process of leaving, moving to a different state. B has told me in secret that they're planning on leaving as well, moving to a different company if they get hired (A doesn't know about this). The company is small (maybe 10-12 people, and 4 of them were hired less than a month ago), and I feel like I might have a shot at B's job, but it's a cyber security company - not a web dev company, which is what I want to do. I'm not sure if I want to pursue a promotion at what I consider kind of a dead end job. One of the companies that I mentioned was hiring is a UX/UI company, hiring actual web developer interns. I think this would be a better job for me, but I don't want to screw over a company that I like and that has treated me well.\n\nSorry for ranting, I know it's a lot, but I'd appreciate any advice, on any part of it.",

    "text": "Need Career Advice - CPA & CFE With 8 Year of Experience Hi all,\n\nI’m looking for some career advice as to what I should do next. I’m a 29-year-old CPA and CFE (Just passed the CFE last week) with 8 years of experience. I was in public accounting for four years doing a mixture of tax and audit for two regional firms (Fuck the big 4). I was a senior accountant and analyst for a healthcare startup for 2 years. Currently, I’m a controller for a small private equity firm that specializes in commercial and residential real estate. It’s a property management company that oversees numerous properties that are held under 40 different taxable entities. Each entity has at least one bank account which means we perform about 75 bank reconciliations a month. Riveting, I know. Basically, I oversee and perform everything accounting and finance related. \n\nI was originally hired by the CFO but he quit in February 2017 to become a CEO for another company. I took over his role and had a coworker promoted to accounting manager. Now it’s me (Controller), an accounting manager, an AP clerk and an AR clerk with some other analysts and admin staff mixed in. \n\nThe CFO acted as a boss, a mentor and a friend. He was constantly teaching and training me. As a result, I learned a great deal of knowledge. However, since he has departed, my learning has flat lined and I’m essentially going through the motions and babysitting the company. I’m afraid that if I stay here much longer, I’ll get technically behind and never make that leap to be a CFO/COO/Executive somewhere else. I don’t know if I should try to get my MBA, CMA or another certification? \n\nThe primary issues are that it’s a family business that is never going to grow, they don’t treat or invest in their employees (everyone is disposable), taking days off is frowned upon and I’m essentially an adult baby sitter. Additionally, I don’t have much say in the decision-making process. I turn 30 in February and kinda freaking out ha ha.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.",

But, if you want to do consulting, there's no reason why you wouldn't want to do it at MBB.\n\n**What's the same**\n\n- The day-to-day work:  The gist of what you do is pretty much the same.  Solve problems, build models, deal with people.  For example, I built a model recently that was pretty much a duplicate of a model I built back at ACN.  I put together a deck on change management that is very similar to what ACN does and the Partner loved it.\n \n- The travel: Yeah, it still sucks.  Still flying economy, still staying at a Westin, still renting from Avis.  Per diem's a little more generous, but then again, I don't get to keep what I don't spend, so it balances out.\n\n- The starting pay is pretty much the same\n\n**What's better**\n\n- The projects: MBB has clients that at ACN we could only dream about.  Where we have the same clients, the MBB projects are with more senior clients, the projects themselves are more interesting, and the stakes are higher (on average, obviously).  The mix of projects is also more skewed towards interesting things like strategy, deals, marketing, etc.  More than at ACN, what you're doing is meaningful for the company and there is something major at risk based on your recommendations.  Best of all, there's ZERO IT implementation projects that some Partner is trying to disguise as MC.  I remember so many people being pissed off when they got bait and switch'd... one of my best friends at ACN quit when a \"Product Strategy\" gig turned into managing the error resolution log for some shitty tablet.  Also, I never had bench issues at ACN, but know that a lot of people did - this isn't an issue at MBB.  Also, never have I felt like I was rubber stamping something.  Never have I had a partner push us to try to change numbers so he could go sell some other project.\n\n- Client relationships:  I feel like at ACN, we were mercenaries and hired guns.  For a lot of clients, we would come in, do some work, leave and have no idea when we would come back (on the Strategy side, obviously on the tech side it's different).  Even on the diamond clients.  MBB really feels like partners with the client.  In a weird parasitic way.  I guess because the clients are often higher up, but we've been working with some people for years and years on different topics.  We really have a pulse on what's going on in a company, the problems they're going to face, and because of that, there's a level of trust that I never saw at ACN.\n\n- Grunt work: there's just no comparison.  You can tell that MBB has been doing this for decades.  At ACN I spent hours and hours of my day doing research, trying to find free excerpts of research reports because the team was too cheap to buy them, Googling images of charts that hopefully appeared in a newspaper or something.  Now?  there's a whole team that does the research for me.  If I see a report I need, I can just buy it.  And don't get me started on comparing ACN's garbage fire of a KX.  Or slide creation.  At ACN I spent so much time making slides, tweaking slides, making them client ready.  QPT or whatever they call it now is shit.  At my firm now, I just draw stuff out, send it to the slide people, and beautiful slides the next morning.  It's incredible - hours and hours of my day freed up just from these two things.\n\n- The pay scale: it's a lot steeper at my MBB than it would have been at ACN.\n\n- Exit opportunities: I can't think of any of my ACN friends leaving to jobs where I'm like, \"damn, I wish I got that.\"  That happens weekly here.  \n\n**What's worse**\n\n- Hours: I probably worked 50 hours at ACN, now I work 60 hours.  I guess 10 more hours doesn't sound like much, but you really feel it.  Plus, it's always gogogogo... at ACN you could easily just take a break here and there - now I feel like there's just no downtime.\n\n- The competition: At ACN, I felt like I could put in 70% effort and still do really well.  Now, I feel like putting in 100% is just average.  On average, the people at MBB are just smarter, or work harder, or worse, both.\n\n- The 'kool-aid': At ACN, I never did any extracurics and it didn't make any difference - still got high ratings.  Now, I feel like I *have* to do stuff like help plan the holiday party or do white papers, etc.  It's not work, but it's still work.  It's time I rather use for something else.",

    "text": "Going for shorter sexier projects or longer more stable projects EDIT: Thanks for your advice so far. Should have been more clear in the post, but I agree the best option would be a good mix of the two paths. However, my office is not big, and people tend to stick to one of those two types of projects here, hence I feel like once I start \"choosing\" one path or another, it will lead me to kind of specialize in one area. So i can either be a true strategic consultant in a way that business school students dream about but get incredibly stressed out in the process, not to mention higher chance of getting bad reviews and not making it to the next level, or find longer term projects that are significantly more boring but more confidence that i can be a consistent high performer. \n\nI know it all depends on my risk tolerance, how long i would like to stay in consulting and others, but would love to hear opinions based on personal experience, from people who have been at similar crossroads. Gracias!\n\n=================\n\nWould like advice on the crossroad i am at right now. \n\nBackground: Joined an mbb office (non-US) right after undergraduate program, and i have been working at this firm for more than two years now. I have worked with two types of projects since i joined... Shorter highly strategic projects which usually involve increasing revenue / sales, vs. longer projects that are very structured, functional, like transforming a supply chain system top to bottom. Senior managers and colleagues tend to \"specialize\" on one type of projects, and i am at a position where i know people from both aisles pretty well, and have some control over where i would like to take my career. The two options come with pros and cons:\n\nPath one - shorter strategic work\n\nPros: problems i am solving are cooler. C-level execs of my clients recognize my face. Experience is very diversified, i have lots of cool stories (and meaningful impact driven bits) to talk about with colleagues and interviewers. Would most likely lead to cooler exit options. \n\nCons: hours are bad and unpredictable. Higher ups on these projects tend to have little patience and regards for personal life. I get worse reviews on these projects than the ones i get from longer projects since expectation is higher. Work is a lot more stressful in general. People who sell these projects have tons of proposals going on, so being part of this group means i have to put in a ton of efforts on non billable work like proposals. Projects also feel high risk, as screwing one thing big can screw a career over. \n\nPath two - longer projects focused on functional expertise\n\nPros: hours are manageable. People smile more and are pleasant under each other more often due to lower level of stress. I get better reviews since expectation seems lower. I develop knowledge that is very tangible, something that i can talk about for hours. People in this group look to be open to staying in the firm longer, unlike Group A where a lot of burnt out people take exits all the time. This group seems to have more people who truly care about others' development vs. the other group which has more competitive gunners. \n\nCons: projects can sometimes be boring. May be a bit slow and uninteresting. Seems superstars of my firm are mostly aligned to the other group... Exit options out of this group seem worse. \n\nThank you for your advice.",

    "text": "Building out our startup's COO level planning, process and people architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.) Hey y'all. \n\n**Quibbl is an early stage startup.** We are trying to make a big dent in the news aggregation space by borrowing from fantasy sports adn markets to create user-sourced aggregation system that uses a competitive game like dynamic where users compete to earn credibility by correctly predicting the outcomes to news events and trends, allowing us to use credibility as the basis for crowd sourcing. \n\nCheck it out. Quibbl.me - go make your bets on Game of Thrones, ACHA & sports stuff\n\n\n**Fair enough**\n\nWe were Y Combinator finalists this year, and though we have a long ways to go, we have been making great strides building out a top-notch tech team, going to our users and collecting massive product feedback & building out a media & content team that is beggining to produce some really cool stuff.\n\nThere's just one problem. We are growing too fast and our organizational infrastructure is a mess.\n\n**Personally, i would feel like we were in a good place if we had the following locked down:**\n\nVision:\nTeam formation & team context:\nProcesses / playbooks\nProcedures \nWorkflow management\nKnowledge library / file storage\nTalent library (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.)\n\n**However this is the current state\"**\n\n\n**Vision:** we have a pretty clear verbal roadmap, some basic power points that convey it. I think for onboarding the team and keeping people in sync at the org levle, we are pretty okay. HOWEVER, for places where the devil is in the details (the specific tradeoffs we want to make for user acquisition strategy, detailed requirements for our analytics engine and detailed product feedback requirements, those exist in various documents, are subject to interpretation and the subject of a lot of unnecessary friciton and guessing. In won't come over night, but i'd like to have a clearer book of \"standards\" (could basically function as a 10 page appendix of 1 page memos covering our \"vision standards\" to a level of granularity that reflects what's needed to make our typical business decisions and ensure good integration across teams\n\n**Team formation & team context:** as we onboard new teammembers, we have a pretty good oral process, that gives a good overview of the teams, their book of work, how they fit together etc. But it's inefficient (relies on me to tell each person what's going on in the company, and subject to me being on and their recall). Starting to flesh out the core onboarding document to give a 2-3 page overview of each team's responsibilities, current context and book of work. Meantime, trying to develop a more granular and standard questionnaire so every month i meet with a team we use it as a forcing mechanism to get everyone in sync on what we are doing and how pieces fit together.\n\n**Processes / playbooks:**  one of the biggest problems with onboarding new people is people run into walls and don't know what to do. I am the key man / only one who knows how to do a ton of things in the company, from working analytical prototypes to how to manage our social media accounts. I don't have capacity or mental energy to hand these off in a good way, and i feel like if we just had a list of the top 10 most painful processes, and an organized dashboard to start storing them down, batch by batch, we could get out of the mess. \n\n**Procedures** - see above \n\n**Workflow management** - we are putting work into the workflow system asana and that seems to help. But things get put in a non-standardized way, assignments are often incomplete or misentered. If we could get the book of procedures tight, we could that automate the workflow for most types of deliverables, which would massively reduce confusion, bottlenecking and the overhead of having to retrain people because their is no standard body of knowledge \n \n**Knowledge library / file storage** - our files are totally fucked up. So much good work, spread over so many different files, some of which have brilliant gems, but across a chaois of brainstorming that represented the last year. We scrap our document library we lose a ton of good work and criticial thinking that was done to shape our product to date (prototypes that haven't landed in our core code), procedures that are mixed in with people's personal notebooks, etc. But i lack the bandwith to go organize it all myself. If i could get an nice clean inventory of all the documents, i could start tagging, sorting them and identifying like documents taht could be sorted, organized and archived, but i need the right tool / inventory design and that takes thinking.\n  \n**Talent library** (who are our people, contact info, expectations, legal docs, individual expectations, training, key meetings they need to attend, etc. - also what our our current talent gaps, where are the bottlenecks and what roles do we have unfilled, etc.) \n\nIf i could have a top down scan of my peoople, have quick and dirty weeekly metrics (who has their individual charters / responsibiilities setup, when was the last time their documents were audieted and kept to standard, are they in the right meetings, etc?) that would go such along way to get us from bad to good.\n\n**current focus:** buidling out some k level versions of these tools and populating them by end of week. That said, i can't help but think i'm not the first person to have to go build an organization from scratch. are their any good tools out there that are designed to prompt this work, capture it in an organized way, etc. etc.\n\nsome sort of template or tool that already exists in excel would be great. i know the answers, i just need a good enough tool that will put it all together and i don't want to reinvent the wheel on tired eyes\n\n\n**Any suggestions for easy templates / existing spreadsheets to build out my startup's COO level architecture (process mapping, inventory of my people, pillar by pillar metrics, etc.)**\n\nWe have about 3 core teams, about 2-3 groups of people per team, and about 25 project contributors. This seems too complex to manage via weekly memo, without the right structure underneath it. Or at least, i'm finding i need some more structure.\n\n**Any other ideas? How would you go about solving this wonderful mess?**",

    "text": "Does anybody here have a sibling who contributes to the Black dating issues? I mean the typical issues like the idea that non Black women/men are better than Black people. My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

    "text": "I'm just wondering if there are any LEO's, Prosecuting Attorneys, Judges or politicians/bureaucrats that lurk or post here. I only ask because if there are, how, exactly do you function in your job knowing what you read in this subreddit? Do you work to change any of it? Do these things being expressed by us seem ok to you somehow? Do you feel powerless to change it? Are all these men and women simply wrong about how the world works and what should be done to change it?\n\nI've been working for the past few years to finally do whatever it takes to overcome the abuse, addiction, trauma, depression and feelings of abandonment I've had to suffer these past 56 years. I tried and failed over and over again despite being as diligent and persistent as I could.\n\nI've risen and fallen so many times I can barely remember some of them. If you are one of the people I mentioned in the title, do you understand that there are tens and HUNDREDS of thousands of men like me? Do you feel you bear NO responsibility to us? Do you ever ponder what will begin to happen if you keep doing what you do?\n\nEvery day. Every. Single. Day. In spaces like this and others you read, see and hear about male imprisonment, alienation of fathers, butchering the genitals of male infants, VAWA, the Duluth Model and the attendant arrest policies and training for LEOs. The educational and academic crises boys and men are facing. Terrorizing men in the workplace, in social situations, hell, at the PARK ffs... I swear, I could go on forever with this list.\n\nAre you all afraid to address these things? Do you just not understand them and so feel you can't do anything about them? Are you all stupid, or just malicious and indifferent? Regardless of how you answer those questions, do you have any concern for what will happen if you DON'T address them? If your answer to THAT question is no, then I'll have to conclude that you are stupid... Because there are many, many more of us thrown away men EVERY DAY. We're giving up. We're killing ourselves (either quickly with guns, ropes and other forms of violence or slowly with drugs, alcohol or other self-destructive behaviors).\n\nThe hell of it is, society is telling us NOT to give up! I hate to be the one to bring this up, but what do you suppose will happen if we DO stop giving up and killing ourselves...? Do you honestly believe we will simply accept our lot in life and remain quietly on the garbage pile you've put us on? Again, that's just willful blindness and ignorance.\n\nAnd whom do you point us to in the social sphere...? Men like Jackson Katz, Michael Kimmel & Michael Messner? Women like Amanda Marcotte, Jessica Valenti and Clementine Ford? Jeezus, the most honest example of a woman even recognizing the humanity of ordinary men is Brene Brown.... She's a protege of Oprah Winfrey!! Sorry, but that's just not gonna cut it.\n\nDo you all in the public sector just not understand the forces you're playing with? Don't you get it?\n\nWhat the hell is going to happen when this all leaks out into the streets and you have open, violent unrest and conflict... Not between classes, or races or politics or religion, but among the genders? How the hell are you going to manage that? Really. I'd love to hear the contingency plan for open, violent conflict between men and women breaks out.\n\nLike I said, tens and hundreds of thousands of us now, and more every day. Just lately we either kill ourselves or just ghost to one degree or another.\n\nYou all do NOTHING about this other than more draconian laws, more anti-male policies for employers, educators and healthcare providers, the outright embarrassment that is social support for victimized men and boys and more and more aggressive, brutal and punitive law enforcement and courtroom policies aimed solely at MEN.\n\nHow long do suppose we're going to put up with this...?",

    "text": "A Socialist Defense of Gender Roles Edit: wow.  I've never seen such quick downvotes.   Remember that this is supposed to be a discussion forum not an ideological purity contest.   Only downvote if you think this post has contributed nothing to the debate.   \n\nEdit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   \n\nUnusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  \n\nMRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Minor issue I had in person with a feminist. (Not anti-feminism) First off, apologies if this is not the right kind of subreddit for this post, I am just wanting to have a little vent so feel free to delete or whatever if it doesn't fit.\n\nA little background; I am an Assistant Manager at a pub in a large town in England, and have worked there nearly 4 years now. We are just outside of the centre so rarely get any crazy customers, however last Saturday was an exception.\n\nTo set the scene, I was barely 20 minutes into my shift when I had to call down the landlord to deal with some customers (a couple, male and female) who were complaining. He told them basically exactly what I did, they were not happy about it and ended up getting arrested for assault on him and another member of staff.\n\nWhilst the landlord and other member of staff were at the police station giving their statements, a fairly drunk customer tripped outside and had a gash on his nose. Being the designated first-aider I dealt with that and he was a great sport and his friends were taking the mick out of him.\n\nNo sooner had I dealt with that then I was told of a customer who was harassing some other customers. So I went to see what was going on, got the guy away from the people he was harassing and was chatting to him to ask what happened. The jist of it was that he is a bigoted anti-feminist who was spewing a bunch of insults at a group of customers, specifically at the two women in that group. He was taken away by his more sober and reasonable friend and I went to go talk to the group he harassed to get their side and smooth things over.\n\nThis is where the actual reason for this post lies. The rest was just showing that it has been a hectic night and by this point I haven't been behind the bar to serve people for the past 2 hours as I have been dealing with these incidents.\n\nSo I am letting these women rant about this guy and it was obvious that he was the instigator and the issue. Part of which was him accidentally knocking over one of their £19 bottles of beer they had barely had any of. Once they have finished with their story I feel like the best way to smooth this over is to apologise for his behaviour and offer them a replacement bottle and a round on the house. \n\nSo I say something along the lines of \"... so I would like to get you guys another bottle and a round on us.\" And before I could say anything further the larger of the two women puts her hand outstretched towards me and said:\n\n\"I've got to stop you there, I don't like the way you referred to us as 'guys', we are ladies and would like to be referred to as such. Maybe in future think of using something like 'folks' when referring to people as that is a non-gendered word.\"\n\nI was just so taken aback by this statement, these customers have been present since before the aforementioned arresting incident and must have some idea of how stressful and hectic this shift has been. I am here offering them a lot of free drinks and this woman has the audacity to tell me off for using what I think of as a fairly generic term for a group of people. I do understand that 'guys' is a gendered term, however in the context there was no gender attachment required.\n\nOut of all the things that happened that night (as that was not the last incident either, must have been a full moon or something...), this one snippet has bothered me the most over the past few days. And that statement by her was followed during my stunned silence by her asking if I was okay to authorise giving away so much beer, asking me where the manager was.\n\nNow the structure of staff at the pub is; Landlord/Owner and his wife, then myself and another Assisstant Manager, then the rest of the bar staff. Meaning that whilst the Landlord was away giving a police statement, such decisions to give away beer by way of apology is well within my right.\n\nI am a white male at a fairly average height with a slimish build, and I am 21. So I can kind of see where she is coming from as usually you would expect someone older to be managing a pub, but to voice it as condescendingly as she did, right after telling me off for saying 'guys' is in my eyes, very insulting and extremely hypocritical. I was tempted to just tell her to sod off and walk away, but unfortunately I decided keeping some semblance of professionalism was the easier route.\n\nSorry for the rant, this went on longer than I expected. And sorry if this is not the right content for this subreddit.\n\ntl;dr - feminist tells me off for referring to their mixed gender group as 'guys' whilst I was offering them free stuff, and then proceeds to assume I didn't have the authority to give stuff away anyway.",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",

    "text": "\"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters - The religious roots of feminism Excerpt from \"Feminism: A Very Short Introduction\", by Margaret Walters \n\n[Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Short-Introduction-Margaret-Walters/dp/019280510X)\n\n\n***\n\nSome of the first European women to speak out for themselves, and for their sex, did so within a religious framework, and in religious terms. It is perhaps not always easy, in our secular society, to bring them back to life: to recognize fully their courage, or to understand the implications, or the extent, of their challenge to the status quo.\n\nFor centuries, and all over Europe, there were families who disposed of ‘unnecessary’ or unmarriageable daughters by shutting them away in convents. For some, this must have felt like life imprisonment; but for others, conventual quiet seems to have facilitated genuine fulfilment: it allowed some women to develop a talent for organization, and some were able to read and think, and discover their own distinctive voices. Hildegard of Bingen, who was born at the end of the 11th century and became a nun, and later the abbess, of a small Rhineland convent, has long been known as a remarkable and impressive writer; recently, her great musical talent has been rediscovered and celebrated. But she was sometimes plagued with doubts about her ‘unfeminine’ activities, and wrote to one of the leading churchmen of the time, Bernard of Clairvaux, asking if she – an uneducated woman – should continue with her writing and with composing. He encouraged her, and within a few years she was known and honoured all over Europe. When she was 60 years old, she embarked upon preaching tours all through the German empire, even though at that time only priests were allowed to preach.\n\nLike other medieval women, when seeking to imagine the almost unimaginable, and to communicate her understanding of God’s love, she turned to womanly, and specifically maternal, experience, and wrote of the ‘motherhood’ of God. ‘God showed me his grace again’, she writes, ‘as . . . when a mother offers her weeping child milk.’ Some religious women imagine, with maternal tenderness, the infant Jesus. A Flemish Beguine meditates on what the mother of God must have felt:\n\n>for three or more days [she] held Him close to her so that He nestled between her breasts like a baby . . . sometimes she kissed him as though he were a little child and sometimes she held Him on her lap as if He were a gentle lamb.\n\n‘Just because I am a woman, must I therefore believe that I must not tell you about the goodness of God . . . ?’ asked the Englishwoman Julian of Norwich in the early 15th century. She marveled that ‘he who was her Maker chose to be born of the creature that is made’. Moreover, she argued:\n\n>our Saviour is our true mother in whom we are eternally born and by whom we shall always be enclosed . . . We are redeemed by the motherhood of mercy and grace . . . to the nature of motherhood belong tender love, wisdom and knowledge, and it is good, for although the birth of our body is only low, humble and modest compared with the birth of our soul, yet it is he who does it in the beings by women it was done.\n\nWhereas other women had made the analogy briefly, Julian of Norwich goes on to spell out the comparison very directly. Christ is like\n\n>the kind, loving mother who knows and recognizes the need of her child, and carefully watches over it. The mother can give her child milk to suck, but our dear mother Jesus can feed us with himself, and he does so most generously and most tenderly . . .\n\nMargery Kempe, a contemporary of Julian’s who travelled from her Essex home to visit her, produced an account of her own life – probably dictated to a scribe – that has been described as the first autobiography in English. Her life story reveals, only too clearly, why her self-preoccupation and her melodramatic acting out of her own miseries infuriated so many people who came into contact with her. But her story is also, unexpectedly, a deeply touching one; and more than that, it is impressive simply because she insists on taking herself and her experiences seriously. Margery came up against the painful and terrible aspect of the motherhood that had inspired the celibate Julian. She was miserably ill all through her first pregnancy, and after a prolonged and very painful birth, was left exhausted and depressed: ‘what with the labour she had in childbirthing and the sicknesse going before, she despaired of her life’. At times, she came near to killing herself. She was comforted, she recalls, by a vision of Christ, in the form of a handsome young man sitting at her bedside; he informed her that ‘you may boldly, when you are in bed, take me to you as your wedded husband’. But it was only years later, and after 14 pregnancies, that Margery finally managed to negotiate a deal with her demanding mortal husband: if he stopped insisting on sex, she would pay off his debts, and forgo her strict Friday fast to eat and drink with him. He agreed, though with a hint of sarcasm that echoes nastily across the centuries: ‘May your body be as freely available to God as it has been to me.’\n\nWith remarkable energy and determination, Margery then set out across Europe on a pilgrimage, and though her constant weeping and wailing so infuriated her fellow pilgrims that they abandoned her en route, her courage – and obsessive determination – enabled her to reach Jerusalem, and eventually to get as far as Constantinople.\n\nBy the late 16th century, increasing numbers of women were beginning to argue their case more consistently and more aggressively, though still within a religious framework. The Reformation enabled more women to receive an education. In\n\n1589, in what one historian has called ‘the earliest piece of English feminist polemic’, Jane Anger took up a challenging position by insisting that Eve was superior to Adam: a second, and hence improved, model. Whereas Adam was fashioned from ‘dross and filthy clay’, God made Eve from Adam’s flesh, ‘that she might be purer than he’, which ‘doth evidently show how far we women are more excellent than men . . . From woman sprang man’s salvation. A woman was the first that believed, and a woman likewise the first that repented of sin.’ Anger then descends crossly, and comically, to everyday domestic life. It is women, she reminds us, who make sure that men are fed, clothed, and cleaned: ‘without our care they lie in their beds as dogs in litter, and go like lousy mackerel swimming in the heat of summer’.\n\nBut any woman wanting to defend her sex had to tackle powerfully negative scriptural images of women: Delilah was treacherous, Jezebel murderous, while Eve was directly responsible for the Fall of the human race: ‘the woman tempted him and he did eat’. Saint Paul was regularly invoked against any woman who spoke out, or asked awkward questions about the Church’s attitude to women: ‘Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted to them to speak’, he instructed the Corinthians. And again, in the epistle to Timothy, ‘if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home: for it is shame for women to speak in the church’.\n\nGradually, a few women found the confidence to defy these scriptural prohibitions. Some offered dissenting interpretations of Genesis, arguing that Adam was, after all, as much to blame for the Fall as Eve. So, in 1611, Aemilia Lanyer reminded her readers that Christ\n\n>was begotten of a woman, born of a woman, nourished of a woman, obedient to a woman . . . he healed women, pardoned women, comforted women . . . after his resurrection, appeared first to a woman.\n\nAnd Rachel Speght sardonically remarked in 1617:\n\n>If Adam had not approved that deed which Eve had done, and been willing to tread the steps which she had gone, he being her head would have reproved her, have made the commandment a bit to restrain him from breaking his master’s position.\n\nOthers insisted that God had signalled his forgiveness by making Mary, a descendant of Eve, the mother of Christ.\n\nIn the course of the troubled 17th century, particularly among the sects, the many and various small groups that rejected the established Church in favour of purer forms of worship, women found more freedom. Some, at least, felt inspired to preach or to prophesy. Modern historians have pointed out the important role of women among the religious separatists who fled persecution in late Elizabethan England by emigrating to America or to Holland, as well as their activity as preachers. Women were active, too, among the small dissenting groups that managed to survive underground in England, until, during the Civil War and\n\nInterregnum, they emerged dramatically and vocally. Keith Thomas lists some of these independent congregations: Brownists, Independents, Baptists, Millenarians, Familists, Quakers, Seekers, Ranters. Whatever their theological differences, they all believed the necessity for spiritual regeneration in every individual. The experiencing of what Quakers called the ‘Inner Light’ was more important than external observance – and that light knows no sexual distinction. As one contemporary writer claimed, ‘one faithful man, yea, or woman either, may as truly and effectually loose and bind, both in heaven and earth, as all the ministers in the world’.\n\nVarious independent congregations had, for some time, been allowing women to debate publicly and to vote on matters of  Church business; by the 1640s some, particularly among the Quakers, were going further. In 1659, the Quaker Fox argued that ‘Christ is in the male as in the female, who redeems from under the Law . . . Christ in the male and female, who are in the spirit of God, are not under the Law.’\n\n‘Might not the spirit of Christ, that is begotten of God in the female as well as the male . . . speak?’ asked Katherine Evans and Sarah Chevers. Increasingly often, women felt moved, divinely inspired, to speak in meetings and even at service, though they were often greeted with bitter opposition. They were criticized for being ‘puffed up with pride’ and ‘vainglorious arrogance’, and even worse, for ‘usurping authority over men’. In 1646, for example, John Vicars complained bitterly about ‘bold impudent housewives . . . without all womanly modesty who take upon them . . . to prate . . . most directly contrary to the apostle’s inhibition’.\n\nJohn Bunyan was totally opposed to this active participation by women, arguing that Satan, inevitably, tempts the weaker Eve, rather than Adam: ‘the man was made the head in worship, and the keeper of the garden of God’. He referred to women as ‘that simple and weak sex’. Citing the first epistle to the Corinthians, he argued that women are ‘not the image and glory of God as the men are. They are placed beneath.’ He disapproved of separate women’s meetings, which did nothing but encourage ‘unruliness’. ‘I do not believe they [women] should minister to God in prayer before the whole church,’ he insisted, adding sarcastically, ‘for then I should be a Ranter or a Quaker.’ In any public gathering, ‘her part is to hold her tongue, to learn in silence’\n\nEven in the 1670s, that courageous Quaker Margaret Fell still felt the need to defend women’s independence of conscience, and their right to play an active part in worship. In a tract called Women’s Speaking Justified, she argued emphatically: ‘Those that speak against . . . the spirit of the Lord speaking in a woman, simply by reason of her sex . . . speak against Christ and his Church, and are of the Seed of the Serpent.’\n\nThe prophet Joel was sometimes cited as an answer to Saint Paul’s prohibition spirit upon all flesh:\n\n> . . . and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions: And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit. And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.\n\nJoel’s ecstatic vision seemed, to many, particularly relevant during the great upheavals caused by the Civil War and the Interregnum; there was a widespread feeling that apocalypse was, indeed, imminent. The sect who styled themselves Fifth Monarchists, for example, believed that the world’s four great secular empires – Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome – having passed away, the fifth – Christ’s Kingdom and the rule of the saints – was close at hand. In this feverish and volatile climate, prophets, many with revolutionary ideas, flourished.\n\nIn this area, a woman’s supposed passivity, her receptivity to outside influence, could, ironically, be claimed as an advantage: she might prove more receptive, more open, to becoming a channel for the voice of God. The Belgian prophet Antonia Bourigue, who was widely read in England, produced a disconcerting and double-edged justification: ‘they ought to let God speak by a woman, if it be His Pleasure, since he spoke in former times to a Prophet by a Beast’.\n\nBut the line between prophetic inspiration and lunacy, between possession by God and by the devil, was a narrow one. In 17th-century England, women were still being tried for witchcraft. Moreover, female prophets could easily be dismissed as merely crazy. Lady Eleanor Davis, for example, had been claiming divine inspiration for years; early one morning in 1625, she heard ‘a Voice from Heaven, speaking as through a trumpet these words, There is nineteen years and a half to the Judgement Day’. She went on to publish tracts that were interpreted as predicting, amongst other things, the death of Charles I. Her husband burned her books; and she was often the butt of jokes. An anagram of her name – Dame Eleanor Davis: Never so mad a ladie – was gleefully circulated. But her visionary fervour put her at real risk; even her rank could not protect her from charges of treachery. In 1633, after being charged before the High Commission that ‘she took upon her (which much unbeseemed her sex) not only to interpret the Scriptures . . . but also to be a prophetess’, she was fined and imprisoned in Bedlam. But she came into her own during the Interregnum, when many of her prophecies seemed to have been realized. She went on to publish at least 37 tracts between 1641 and her death 11 years later.\n\nAnother prophetess, Anna Trapnel, experienced some kind of revelation at a Baptist church in London. By 1652, she had joined the Fifth Monarchists, and in 1654, she accompanied a male preacher to Whitehall, where she fell into a trance that lasted for 12 days. Crowds gathered to hear her prophecies – and her harsh criticisms of Oliver Cromwell and his government – which were recorded in Strange and Wonderful News from Whitehall and The Cry of a Stone. She insisted – in verse – that God’s message was addressed to women as well as men:\n\n>John though wilt not offended beThat handmaids here should sing, That they should meddle to declare The matters of the King . . . .\n\nThe authorities labelled her as mad, but still brought her to trial. ‘The report was that I would discover myself to be a witch when I came before the justices, by having never a word to answer for myself’, she said. But her sheer volubility defeated the court, and she continued, undeterred, with her prophecies. Cromwell’s government undoubtedly took this kind of prediction seriously; several times, he and his council were interrupted by, and seriously listened to, prophets, several of whom were women.\n\nThe appeal to divine inspiration was probably of limited value as a means of female emancipation; the feminism of the future would depend less on the assertion of women’s spiritual equality and more on natural rights, and a denial that there is any intellectual difference between the sexes.\n\nBut there were political implications to this outburst of religious fervour. In the 16th century, the Anabaptists had recognized women as equal to men, and allowed them to pray and speak in meetings. Women from the congregations who styled themselves Levellers seem to have been particularly active on a larger stage, and showed considerable political shrewdness. The sect encouraged women’s activity, believing in the equality of all ‘made in the image of God’. In the 1640s and early 1650s, when many of their husbands were in prison, Leveller women repeatedly turned up en masse at\n\nWestminster – staging what sounds very like contemporary ‘demonstrations’ – to demand freedom for their husbands, but also to complain bitterly about their own, consequent hardships. They were usually treated harshly, and rebuked for meddling in things beyond their understanding. The crowds of women who petitioned for peace in 1642 and 1643 were dismissed contemptuously as ‘Whores, Bawds, Oyster women, Kitchen maids’. Three hundred women, who presented another petition to the House of Lords, were rejected out of hand by the Duke of Lennox. ‘Away with these women,’ he exclaimed, adding, with a jeer, ‘we were best have a Parliament of women.’ In May 1649 yet another petition for the release of the Leveller prisoners was turned away sarcastically: ‘It was not for women to Petition, they might stay at home and wash the dishes.’ To which the women, unabashed, retorted, ‘we have scarcely any dishes left us to wash’.\n\nLater in that year, they tried again. As many as ten thousand women signed yet another petition, asking:\n\n>We cannot but wonder and grieve that we should appear so despicable in your eyes as to be thought unworthy to petition to represent our grievances to this honourable House. Have we not an equal interest with the men of this nation in those liberties and securities contained in the Petition of Right, and other good laws of the land? Are any of our lives, limbs, liberties or goods to be taken from us, no more than from men, but by due process of law . . .\n\nA thousand women carried it to the House with sea-green ribbons pinned to their breasts. Once again, they were dismissed scornfully.\n\nBut among the Quakers, particularly, women found the chance to develop their skills as administrators. Regular women’s meetings were set up alongside the men’s meetings in the 1650s; and though, from the beginning, women seem to have concentrated on traditionally feminine areas, such as welfare and moral problems, they had the chance to develop their own, very effective organization, which in fact handled considerable sums of money. However, historians have suggested that there was a gradual reduction in the scope of their concerns; by the 1680s, they were confining themselves to ‘womanly’ matters. In these later years, they concentrated on ‘such things as are proper to us, as the poor more especially and the destitute amongst us’. These included helping young men to find apprenticeships or work, and instructing younger women ‘to all wholesome things’, which included looking after their husbands, children, and homes, and always behaving in a manner that was ‘discreet, chaste, and sober’.\n\n***\n\nImage from the chapter: http://i.imgur.com/16cTngI.png\n\n*\"The scene is viewed with a hint of satire – though is it directed at the earnest speaker or at the inattentive audience?

    "text": "Help - Being \"Professionally\" Bullied at Work **Background:** I currently work in the advertising industry, specifically Digital Ad Operations, for a big-name company. My job is to work on the technical side of things, generating (not by hand) the code necessary to make ads display on websites (among other things) and then deliver them to contacts at websites such as Facebook, YouTube, etc. I've work in an office setting before, but this is my first job out of college. In my experience, and also in what I've read and seen, it's general a job that is \"tailored\" to straight-out-of-college employees. You are not expected to have any prior knowledge of the job, but you *are* expected to be competent enough to pick it up quickly. In other words, it's not something you study for in college. The job is request-based by nature, meaning you get an email with the task, confirm receipt, do it, and then confirm that it's finished. I've worked here for a little over 2 years now. \n\n-----------------------\n\n**The Issues:** Since I've been here, I haven't been promoted. I understand that this is something earned. However, going from entry level to Senior is not something particularly difficult. Half of it is about doing a good job, while the other half of it is just...a participation award, really. Meaning, just do your work and eventually you will/should get promoted. Since I've been here, I noticed that performance reviews are not a thing; in my over 2 years here, I have not had one. I've asked for one several times, and I've gotten mixed responses ranging from, **Director:** *\"Well, I've reached out to upper management about a formal process, but haven't heard back\"*, to *\"Eventually, we will get to that.\"* The problem with this is that since I've been here, I've barely gotten any positive feedback. I've seen waves of coworkers promoted (which is a $13,000 increase in pay), while I remain a entry level, despite overwhelmingly-positive feedback from other director and managers that I work with. Even those I've never met in person, and who I've only spoken with on the phone. I have a reputation for going above and beyond to resolve issues when I can help it. I won't lie and pretend that I haven't made any mistakes, but I would say that the majority of my work is objectively very good. I've lost track of how many times I've ended up in meeting rooms with my director and new manager (who was previously my supervisor and was promoted). The topics have ranged from:\n\n\n\n* **Lateness:** It is true that I had issues arriving on time way back when I started, but I've made great strides to arrive on time or even early. For reference, I work in NYC, and there are train issues almost every day. I've come to realize that this is my problem and mine alone, and that I need to work around this. However, what really bothers me is that I broke my wrist in February and notified my manager that I needed extra time to get ready in the morning. She said this was okay. I arrived in the office one morning sometime between 9:45 AM and 10 AM, and my director immediately called me into a meeting room. She opened with a rude and sarcastic remark, and then told me that she was reporting me to HR for arriving late so often. I showed her my broken wrist and she acted like she didn't know, which is impossible considering she and my manager speak often, even if she's never actually in the office. She asked me if I needed disability leave, and I said no. Eventually the meeting ended, and she still reported me to HR. I visited HR to explain my situation, and the woman understood.\n\n* **Unexplained absences from my desk:** This one has never really been elaborated on; it's just kind of tacked on with no examples. I get up to go to the bathroom, get a coffee or water, or just stretch my legs. I might go across he street to Starbucks or something, but it's not as if I'm gone for more than 15 minutes. My job is a desk job, and in the words of my previous manager, sometimes you need a break from the screen as the work can become a blur. My work still gets done in a timely manner. Additionally, we don't get paid during our lunch breaks, yet my manager told me that the director said *\"If you have time to take a lunch break, you're not busy.\"*\n\n* **\"Sitting\" on requests:** My director claims I sit on work before starting it, but that isn't true. My team and I CC each other on emails/work that involves us all, but not work that is specific to one person. When I have been busy with such work, I notify my team so they know that I'm working on something and can't assist them with anything else. \n\n* **\"Unnecessary pushback on work\":** Absolutely no idea where this is coming from. If we receive a request that isn't sent in the correct format, we kindly ask the person(s) sending it to resubmit it correctly. Again, not really sure where this is coming from. \n\n----------------------\n\n**Other Concerns:**\n\n* The environment is very much upper management looking after themselves. My director hires people who do little to no work to work with her/under her. She promoted a manager who is almost never in the office to an Associate Director position, a position which never existed until then. This Associate Director told us that her \"role is undefined\" when my manager asked her why she doesn't help us out\n\n* My director is a people-pleaser. She doesn't defend us at all; she lets our team take the fall for everything\n\n* My manager quit because she was thrown under the bus by my director and her name and reputation became tarnished in the company; another company that we pay to QA our ads let something pass QA that shouldn't have, and my manager got in trouble instead of representatives from that company. \n\n* My director hired *another* Associate Director rather than promote my manager, which roadblocked her career, which was the final straw for her and ultimately the reason she left. This new AD doesn't know how to do the work.\n\n* I've witnessed my director fire an employee of 10 years, who had an 8-month pregnant girlfriend, semi-publicly; he came out of a meeting room crying and was told to grab and his stuff and leave. The company hired him back the same day in another department. She did the same to another coworker, no bag or box provided.\n\n* We have lost 12 people in a year, on a team of about 20. I think we're about 8-10 people now. For every 3 or so people who leave, we get 1 new person. The team has been understaffed for a while, and it's a universal concern among my coworkers. We get the usual, \"We're interviewing\" from upper management, but it seems like they don't care about retention. This is a concern because training people to be able to do this job autonomously takes a lot of time and babysitting, for lack of a better term. Additionally the work becomes stressed and strained with the additional workload, due to the nature of the job\n\n* Previously, I had a senior (one who started 7 months after me, and who I had trained...), a supervisor, and a manager. All 3 of them have left the company for pretty much the same reasons. My team (meaning my immediate team) is just me and a new employee who started about 2 months ago, who I have been managing and training. I currently work on/own the biggest account that the company has (a huge consumer products company I cannot mention), as well as a second account, and my new AD has been trying to get me to help out on a third against my insistence that I cannot handle that workload\n\n-------------- \n\n**Current Situation/Why I'm Posting:** My director called a meeting between HR, the new AD (who has been there for about a month), and myself last week. She never told me HR would be there, but when I saw the woman come into the office I packed my things in anticipation of being fired (NY is an At-Will Employment State). While I was nervous, I thought that this would be the end of my sleepless nights, stomach issues from nervousness, and fear/hatred of coming to work. I had started looking for new jobs recently because I had given up hope of getting Senior and being able to apply with that on my resume.  I get into the meeting room, and I notice everyone has a 3-page paper in front of them. My director puts on the good cop impression and starts talking to me about the things I outlined above. I countered them and even provided printed emails from recently, going back two years of the contrary (especially about my quality of work and my reputation within the company). I even showed how she was on these email chains. She didn't care and said something to the effect of, \"While others outside of this department may think you do a great job, I don't.\" I also explained how I am carrying the workload of at least 3 other people/former employees. She still didn't care. The HR woman just sat there taking notes. Eventually she tried to shut me up by saying it was pointless arguing the past, and gave me this Performance Warning/Improvement Plan to look over and sign. It basically details the issues and how we're going to fix them (which are things I have already been doing). I was completely shocked, but took the paper without signing it. At the bottom is a blurb about how NY is an At-Will Employment state and how they can let me go at any time (I knew this already). \n\nOne of my coworkers who left to a competitor referred me at his new place, and I've completed the final round of interviews last week. I feel like I have a very good chance of getting it. I also have a lot of job opportunities/offers from friends and previous coworkers, totally unrelated to this situation. I'm afraid of being fired, but I **do not** want to sign this paper because I don't agree with what I'm being accused of. I've drafted counter-points to send back to the HR woman rather than the signed document, but I fully expect this to be a one-way street. \n\n**What is the correct thing to do in this situation?** I've felt bullied throughout my entire career here, and I feel like the negative feedback has really damaged me over time. It hurt my self-worth and made me feel drained of energy and on-edge/nervous all the time. That's why it took me so long to find the will to leave to another job. I know not to sign this document, but I'm afraid that I'm going to fired immediately. I also know that because I have more experience than most people here, and because I \"own\" the largest account the company has, they will be screwed if I leave on a whim (or even 2 weeks). So I'm kind of in this limbo, where I think they're trying scare tactics on me, but I'm not sure. Thus far, it's been a domino effect of people leaving, and a lot of people who left have shared similar sentiments.",

    "text": "I didn't tell my future employer about my second job. Need advice. UK Hi there all! \n\nFirst I would like to thank this amazing community for all the tips and tricks about job hunting and interview process - it helped A LOT, you are THE BEST!\n\nI am looking for a job in marketing and just had two good interviews with two different companies. \n\nIt will be one of these long posts.\n\n\nBackstory:\n\nI have a uni degree in business related field. Graduated almost 4years ago, but I have started any degree related work in marketing only over a year ago. \n\nWhen I was out of uni I didnt have a clue what to do next, so I wasted a couple of years and made some strange decisions, tried to get to film school, didnt succeed.. oh well it happens.\n\nI found myself on the edge in Summer 2014, I had no money and nowhere to go apart from my parents' house. I was lucky my girlfriend was there for me (we are still together, I love her to bits).\n\nSo my gf offered we can move to her mums place and her step dad will sort us jobs as security guards until we get on our feet financially. (He also lended me money so I could do the course for security guard licence). It was a strange job for a geek like me, it was also long hours and days/nights. Obviously not much professional/personal development involved in any duties.\n\nAfter 8months of working hard, a lot of hours etc. we managed to save a nice sum of money for our new start, we also bought our fìrst car with a portion of that money. It was amazing to get my own car, I still drive it.  So we have moved together to a major city. My gf quickly found herself an ok job in an office. I decided to carry on with my security job part time and really wanted to make the best out of this new start. I went through some deep analysis of myself and decided I will make a great marketing guy, I felt this is something I can be really good at and something that will fullfil me. \n\nI started heavily educating myself on the subject, learning about copywriting, digital tools, strategies, tactics and different concepts on my own. I got some essential knowledge and skills and wanted to find an entry level job in marketing and leave this security job. \n\nI have managed to find a job as admin/marketing guy, for this small office dealing with finances. Working desk to desk with the director of the company. He also was the guy who interviewed. At an interview he said that he can offer me around 3 days a week at minimal wage for start, but promised there will be bonuses and more days of work in a few months. I took this job and was happy I made any step towards my goal, proper career. I thought it will look good on my CV in the future, when I wilk want to get this real job in marketing.\n\nHERE'S WHERE THE PROBLEM STARTS\n\nI have been working in this office as marketing guy 3days a week for minimal wage and then work 2-3days in my security job as cover guard (part-time) it was the only way to support myself financially at the time. \n\nI have been working these two jobs simultaneously for over a year now. \n\nMy office boss made some promises to me at an interview, but never bothered to actually make my job  full time or increase my pay. I didnt care, I was getting some hands on experience on how to run a business and how to talk to clients. My security job was paying my bills. From many things I have learned myself was Wordpress so I started also freelancing making websites and doing photography gigs. So I have 2 part time jobs + freelancing gigs. I often work 6days a week and there's always some project going on. \n\nIt got to the point now that my security licence expires in a few months and my office job taught me a lot but there's no more room for any development and financially it sucks and my boss doesnt care. \n\nI decided I dont want to renew my security licence and I should finally try getting a real job in marketing, full time with a decent pay and normal management.\nAs this mixed lifestyle of being a jack of all trades doesn't really make me feel fulfilled or happy. I feel like I am slipping through life.\n\nI put my CV together and made it look that my only job is the one in marketing as the rest was really irrelevant. I wanted to look more credible, avoid questions about my second job etc.\n\nTHE ACTUAL PROBLEM:\n\nSo I had two interviews that I feel went great. Especially the second one I had, I liked the company, its ethics and the environment. \n\nBefore the interview they asked me to make a presentation about my marketing process in my current job and gave me a task to draft a marketing plan for their company, it was on a very short notice, I had to literally put it together overnight. \n\nI went to the interview in a suit feeling confident (fake it till you make it) and I gave the presentstion that was recieved with a very positive feedback, I was also able to answer all their questions without any bigger problems. It was a looong interview and they asked me a lot of questions regarding my skills, knowledge, aspirations and life in general. Real X Ray scan.\n\nOne of the questions by the end of this interview was about my current salary, I avoided it by telling them that if they want to talk about the money now, all I have to say is that the salary range they are offering suits me and I am sure we will work something out.\n\nI felt I totally nailed this interview, so proud of myself, regardless of the fact they hire me or not. I really kept my shit together and was confident. They also gave me some positive feedback about my presentation and were impressed that I have managed to put it well together on such short notice.\n\n\nAt the very end the HR manager asked everybody to leave and started telling me in detail about their package, benefits etc. and he asked me again about my current salary, as he wanted to see if they match it with their package. I told him how much I made in total last year (didnt mention the fact that my total income includes other job and freelancing). \nAnd that was it.\n\nI am waiting for a call back from them.\n\n\nI started thinking if they decide to hire me (or any other company really) I will have to give them the tax documents from my previous employer, here in the UK it is P45. But if I give them the P45 from my marketing role it will only show them a little fraction of total sum I have earned in my office job and will exclude other sources of my income. This will obviously be a kind of red flag for them and they might get suspicious why is it so low.\n\nI am thinking what are my options here. \nNobody really asked if I have any other jobs at the moment and I never thought to tell them. \n\nI am thinking how can I hide my previous income from my future employer or solve it in any other way. \n\nShould I talk directly to the Tax Man (HMRC)?\n\nI had no bad intentions not telling them about my other job and freelancing, just wanted to look more credible and focused on marketing, as this is my ultimate field of interest. The moment they decide to hire me I will resign from both previous jobs and cut down freelancing.\n\nI am really fighting here for my dreams and manouver throughout my life so I can reach them.\n\n\nWhat do you think Reddit?\n\nI know it's a looong post, but appreciate if anybody made it all the way here :)\n\nMuch Love!",

    "text": "My late term abortion experience Warning this is super long, but thank you in advance if you actually get through it.\n\nHello there. I'm new to the site and thought I'd introduce myself. For now, I'll just go by Siola. That's not my real name. I actually have a pretty uncommon name, and I'd like to keep my abortion pretty much a secret. My husband and I only told my parents, my brother and his wife, and a few close friends. His side of the family does not believe abortion is the right thing to do, so we just thought it would be for the better to say we had a miscarriage. That part hurts. I hate lying to his mom and dad, and other friends. I want to openly support others via Facebook and other social media outlets, but I can't. But, I guess I can here, so that's really nice.\n\nWell a bit more about me. I turn 30 in a couple weeks. I've been with my husband eight years, married almost four years. We have a three year old son, a dog, and two cats. I'm a stay at home mom for now. One day I'd like to go back and finish my bachelors degree in child psychology. Unfortunately during college I had a set back from PTSD, but that's for another place and time I suppose. Well I've struggled with major depressive disorder, anxiety and panic disorder, and like I said before, PTSD for most of my life. Ever since having my son, therapy, and a slew of medications life's been looking up. Until the past year.\n\nLast year (2016) this month (April) I found out I was pregnant with my second child. We were excited, scared, and very happy. Every emotion you could probably feel, my husband and I both felt it. Unfortunately, pregnancies are very rough on me. My last pregnancy I suffered severe Hyperemesis, and this second pregnancy was no different. It felt harder this time, struggling with a crazy toddler. Some amazing timing happened. One of my great friends was far along in her first pregnancy, my best friend in the whole world was expecting her first baby as well, and wouldn't you know it, my sister-in-law was expecting her first baby as well. Our due date was only a month apart. We were excited to have cousins so close in age. Time passed like normal. I remained healthy, baby remained healthy. \n\nDue to my hyperemesis, I always had extra tests done, extra pokes and fluids. To me, that felt normal because of my last pregnancy. The routine fetus ultrasound exam was done a couple weeks ahead at 18 weeks instead of the typical 20 weeks. In retrospect, I'm glad it was. We found out we were going to have a girl. We were beyond thrilled. A boy and a girl. It felt almost like a dream come true. But I noticed the ultrasound technician was spending a lot of time around the head and neck of the fetus. When I asked the doctor when he came in, he said there were some concerns with the nuchal fold aka the neck fat. The neck was measuring larger than normal, sometimes an indication of T21 or Down's syndrome. That was the only indication of anything wrong. At that point, we opted for the Amnio test that checks for chromosomal defects. There was less than 1% indication for anything to go wrong.\n\nTwo weeks past before we heard back from the geneticist. When we did, they wanted us to come in. I immediately knew something was wrong. My husband and I talked beforehand and decided that if the baby did in fact have T21, we would have an abortion. We waited in a large room for what seemed like hours. The geneticist came in with a few pieces of paper in her hand. She sat down and told us our baby had a partial duplication of the 3rd chromosome's right arm. The piece of paper had the exact numbers. I still have them written around somewhere. She told us some basics about children born with T3, a very, very rare disorder, ranging in difficulties for children. But the way she spoke, almost made it seem like no big deal.\n\nThat was until the doctor came in. He two articles on the disorder. The only two he could find about the fetus' certain duplication. In fact, there was only one other case out there all the way in Italy, and only four others since 1978. He was more honest in the rarity of the T3. He encouraged us to do our own research at home. He made appointments upon appointments for the future. An ultrasound every two weeks or so until birth, a referral to major geneticists in the big city. It was all so overwhelming. At that point, we hadn't made any kind of decision on an abortion. All I knew was I was scared and felt so hopeless.\n\nI did a lot of research. Too much research. Here are some examples of the deformities a person with T3 can be born with. Excessive hair on the face, arms, and back. Stunted growth of arms and legs. Sometimes the inability to ever walk or even hold a cup. The average IQ of 65. Heart defects. Genital deformities. Very short lifespan, as early as two years of age. The list really keeps going and going. With the help of my husband, my mother (who had an abortion many years before I was even born), and my best friend, I decided to have an abortion. I felt like I was making this decision for me, my family, and the baby. I didn't feel like that was a life. She wasn't going to be a constant experiment for doctors.\n\nNow it's October. I'm almost 21 weeks along. I need my doctor's support and advice. This place I was going to was a different OB than where I had my son because we had moved to a different city. This OB is part of a major city hospital. They have many receptionists and it's always super busy. I call my OB and ask to make an appointment as soon as possible. The woman on the phone asked me why and I just said, \"I've been working with Dr. so-and-so about my baby's screenings, and I'd like some support on the matter of having an abortion.\" She then very loudly and rudely says back to me, \"Why do you need to see a doctor if you're just going to have an abortion?!\" I then burst into tears, called her the B-word, and hung up. I'll never forget what she said to me, and how it felt. I filed a complaint to the director of that program as soon as possible.\n\nI never went back. For all they know, I had the baby. I missed probably four appointments. I still get calls from my insurance being told I had a baby months after my due date. I'll never go back there.\n\nAfter getting the proper information from my geneticist, I had to make many phone calls. In my state, the legal limit for an abortion is up to 24 weeks. The Planned Prenthood in my large city only went to 19 weeks. I then found a clinic in another even larger city that went only to 22 weeks. My only other hope would be the largest city in my state all the way on the other side. I was coming up on 22 weeks in only a few short days. They were full and I felt devastated. Thankfully, they called me back in a couple days, and said the doctor would squeeze me in.\n\nThe preparation on the sheet seemed so scary. But the scariest part of all was the cost. My abortion was going to cost $2,500. My husband and I are so broke, we don't even have a savings account. Thankfully, I have wonderful parents. We were told the abortion process would take up to three days, so we also got a hotel. $3,000. I almost couldn't believe it! Zero help or funding for someone in my situation.\n\nNow I'll start my experience in the days it took for the abortion process.\n\nDay 1: I'm scared. I have my husband and my mom there with me for support. We drive up, past protesters with unkind remarks on posters, and their gruesome photographs. I honestly peed myself a little as my husband parked the car. Before opening the door, I see more protesters on the side properties with more signs and flyers. I'm 22 weeks pregnant today. Very, very visibly pregnant. I carried much larger this time around. I won't get into politics/religion on this page, but I'll just say, I believe every woman has the right to choose what they do with their own body and no person or diety can say otherwise. I am a believer in God, and I believe he was with me that day and the next. He helped me raise my head up high, and ignore the people screaming their pleas at me. Mom on one arm, and hubby on the other, we walked right through the doors to the clinic, which are thankfully connected to the back parking lot. \n\nInside, it's very packed. There are people of all ages, race, and sex. Many people have supporters with them, but some don't. I'm one of the lucky ones to have my two allowed with me. I get a whole packet with my schedule for the day. Day one was about 8 hours long. First, I had an ultrasound, so they can take pictures, and so the doctor can see everything. You have the option to see the baby or not. I chose not to. When I got to see her, she was perfect. She was healthy. I didn't want to see her again and think of a sick baby. The ultrasound tech had to of been my age. She was awesome. She made me feel confident.\n\nLater on I had some blood work done, no big deal. I also met with a therapist. She explained the process of what they were going to insert into my cervix to naturally dilate my cervix enough to perform the abortion. She explained that it may take up to two nights, but the doctor would check tomorrow. She explained a bit about the after affects of abortion, the risks, the emotional toll. That last part I really hadn't prepared for. She also sent me with a lot of information on counseling, and some grieving information on having an abortion with a wanted pregnancy, and also information for my grieving husband as well.\n\nEven more later on, I met the doctor and he inserted the little wooden rod. He was very gentle, and very supportive. Everyone was supportive there. It was as if everyone read my file and sympathized with me. There were so many patients, yet I felt like the center of attention. I felt blessed. Then I went back to the hotel, and got prepared to be back at 8am.\n\nDay 2: When I arrived there were no protesters. Seems they only come on the day women seek medical advice. Waited a short period and the doctor checked my cervix. Because I had a previous vaginal birth, my cervix responded well, and the abortion could be performed that day instead of the next. I went down alone to the basement where the abortions were performed. One other woman was having a procedure at the same time as me, and two others were in recovery. I slipped into a gown, had on my special fuzzy socks from my mom, and had a special chair to sit in. While waiting, a really awesome nurse was there for me. She injected me with the local anesthetic, that helps calm nerves and ease a bit of pain. While that worked its thing, I waited.\n\nThen, I went into a room, where the nurse talked with me a while. Gave me a great hug, and helped reassure me that I was doing the right thing. I was asked if a medical student could watch and assist the doctor perform the medical abortion. I said yes. Students have to learn some how, right? While waiting for the doctor, I got another injection that basically put me out. I can only explain it like I was awake, but wasn't too aware. The abortion was quick. I felt a quick release of pressure and it was done. I cried. Of course I cried. I just lost my child. In my haze, I sincerely thanked both the men that performed my abortion. For the next hour I sat in my chair, day dreaming and sipping on a Sprite. Afterwords I headed back to my hotel room.\n\nIt was over. My husband and I cried together, our young son confused, but none the less supportive of his mom and dad. We stayed the last night in the hotel because it was already paid for, and the boys were really enjoying the pool. Honestly, that was a nice distraction. \n\nThis next part may seem graphic for some... For the next two weeks, I bled and bled. I bled as much as I did giving birth to my son. There were large clots and cramping. All normal. The hardest part was the phantom kicks. For four or five days I felt her kick. I knew she wasn't there, but psychologically something stuck. Then my milk came in. I was still nursing my toddler, until being pregnant dried me up. He still liked to suckle, as we were weaning. He still nurses past age three now that my milk is in again. I haven't even had a period yet still.\n\nBut anyways, at two weeks post I had an appointment with the doctor again. I had my blood and urine taken, and an ultrasound to make sure everything looked good on the inside. I was still bleeding at this point, but he reassured me that for how far along I was, it was normal and would stop in another week or less. After that appointment, the whole process was officially over. But not emotionally.\n\nMy husband wanted to name the baby. I didn't. But I let him because he's greiving too. Makayla Rose. Her due date was January 20, 2017. My friends and sister-in-law all had their children. My friends had boys and my sister had a girl. She was born very healthy about a month before I was due. I'm still shook up from that whole part of it. But I prayed. Well I yell-prayed. I told God that he make all those babies healthy, or I was done. My faith would completely run out. But here they are. They are wonderful babies, and that makes me so happy. Jealous? Yes. But I'm only human. I'm just thankful I have my beautiful son.\n\nAnd now it's April again. I was just finding out I was pregnant this time last year. I cry almost daily for the child I will never hold in my arms. The sibling my son will never know. I talked about my pregnancies being hard before. Well, while pregnant this last time, my husband and I seriously talked and decided that this would be our last child because of how seriously sick I get. Now that she's not here, we are unsure of the future and having more children. Personally, I'd like to try to get pregnant again, but I can tell my husband isn't emotionally ready.\n\nA part of me wants to get pregnant again in hopes that her little soul finds her way back to us. I know that's not how the world works, but I can't help feeling that way. My depression is so bad, I'm feeling like I did back when I had to be hospitalized for it. Back when my PTSD was in full swing. I don't regret my abortion. I do feel that was the right decision. But, I still feel remorse. I still have those feelings of \"what if?\"\n\nWe told others that the baby simply had a heart defect and passed. Something so complicated turned so simple.\n\nThanks for reading. I've been wanting to write this all down for a while, and I think I found the perfect place to share.",

    "text": "Got a strane email from an older male student but given the context I'm not sure if it's a red flag or not... Backstory for context:\nI am a University student getting my degree and certification in TESOL – Teaching English to speakers of other languages.  I volunteer three-four times a week, two hours each time in a local community college’s ESL classroom.  Each quarter we get old students graduating out of our class (it’s beginning elementary English) and get new students signing up for class.  I speak Spanish and Chinese, as well as English.\n\n\nI always take a special shine (even though I’m not supposed to) to specific students, and certain students really take a shine to me over some of the other classroom assistants.  I like to learn a lot about my students, and usually make an effort to get to class early and stay a little late to get to talk to the students outside of class.  \n\n\nBeginning of my problem:\nLast quarter I had a student, let’s call him Jeng.  He is a late-middle-aged Chinese immigrant, and his wife who I’ll call Xue is also in the class.  He was in our beginning level class, but he’s quite obviously NOT a beginning level English speaker.  He’s damn near fluent, but he just has trouble writing, so needed a quarter in a low level class to catch his writing up with his speaking.  Jeng was always so jovial.  He was very chatty with us, the teachers and the other students.  He always had the most to say, and sometimes could go off on random but entertaining conversation tangents.\n\n\nJeng was VERY complimentary.  To everyone, but I felt like he ‘picked’ on me a lot.  (I say picked but it wasn’t a bad thing, though it was sometimes awkward).  He started out just saying the usual, that I was smart, that I was a good teacher, that I was very helpful.  Then he found out that I speak Chinese, and he would compliment me on my accent, my pronunciation, my vocabulary choice if he ever heard me speaking it.  I’m not a very verbose Chinese speaker though, my vocab is pretty limited, so he would always offer to give me Chinese lessons after class.  \n\n\nThen the compliments got…strange.  He would compliment me on my ‘fair’ skin.  He found out I’m mixed race and then kept telling me I was beautiful and fair for my race (I am very light skinned for my mix but….it’s just a weird compliment to receive, it’s not something I usually take as a compliment but I knew he was just trying to be nice.)  Then he asked me about my ‘white’ side, and I said my ‘white’ side is Dutch, because I tell everyone this, it’s not a secret and I’m not bashful about it.  Then, the next class, he told me ‘You have a very regal air about you, like you could be a fair Dutch queen.’  \n\n\nHonestly I felt like this compliment was way over the top, but what was I supposed to do?  I just tried to deflect in my usual self deprecating way, but he kept insisting for days that I looked like a European queen, or European Princess, or ‘Aristocrat.’  But the thing is, his wife was with him every time he would compliment me, and she would smile and nod, though she wasn’t big on talking (her speaking level was lower than his.)  So, I always got the feeling that these kinds of compliments were somewhat normal to them, and not anything weird.  So I let it go, and chalked it up to a clash of cultures, which happens A LOT in ESL classrooms.  \n\n\nMy current problem:\nI always give out an email address to my students so that they can email me when I’m not in class for homework help, since I assign a lot of them specific homeworks.  But today I got an email from Jeng, who isn’t even in my classroom this quarter, and said he and his wife ‘really like me’.  He wrote ‘My son is coming from China and I think it is good that you meet him!  Then, maybe I can give you Chinese lessons!’ \n\n\nAm I overthinking this?  Is this weird?  Or is this just a little bit overzealously friendly?  I’ve never been to China myself, and so I don’t know if this is a common sort of practice?  My friend joked that maybe he’s trying to set his son up with an American girl but I don’t think that’s the case, I’m pretty sure Jeng told me once his son had a wife or girlfriend or something.  The thing is, if this were a white guy in his early 50s?  I’d probably report him to someone.  But it’s this sweet friendly old Chinese man and his wife, so I feel like there might be a cultural disconnect happening here.\n\n\nI just need someone to tell me ‘no you’re not crazy for feeling weird’ or ‘oh you’re crazy this is a totally normal type of interaction in the context of Northern Chinese culture’ I guess.  What do you ladies think?  I feel like my ‘lady defense’ shield is always up but maybe it shouldn’t be?",

    "text": "How to navigate this situation at work before I leave on good terms? I am currently a female in a male dominated industry and could use some women advice on this situation.  My mentor I used to date for a month along time ago but we’re fine now.  My director I’ve had on and off issues with but we worked through them with flying colors in the past.  And my current manager did or does have a crush on me as was married but I don’t interact with him much as he is in another country. \n\n\nThere was a mix up in my bonus when I first started and I never received it.  I talked to HR about it and my boss and he came back with they could probably give me vacation.  This was about nine months ago.  In the mist of this, I also talked about my salary and it being too low.  He said we would relook at it in Jul.  \n\n\nCome Jul one of my peers is now my boss and lives in another country and was not part of these conversations and my old boss is now our director.  We have a hard time meeting up so we don’t until Oct.  I ask for a promotion in Oct and our director is on board after a trial period but my current boss has some concerns which I have no idea what they are.  About this time I am planning on leaving but my mentor, who is a contractor but also knows these guys, advises me to stay on since I am so close to the promotion. I, however, want at least the pay raise or SOMETHING to show they can keep their word.  I ask for an decision my missed out bonus, a revaluations of my compensation, and lastly a date on when we can see how I do in my trial for a proportion in writing because they kept on leading me on.\n\n\nIn the meeting I get completely side lined.  It was like the minute I put my foot down, I got thrown up the wall.  Our director, comes back with a letter from HR saying I was not qualified for a bonus because of my hiring period.  This was completely different line of events than from when I heard feedback in Feb.  My director told me “the HR guy messed up on my paperwork” and that “they could give me vacation”.  Meanwhile my current manager is on the line and honestly doesn’t seem to be supportive in anyway.  The letter I get from HR says they are working on increasing my pay and it has been adjusted properly.  I am looking at this and I am in a profession which requires a good math brain, this is bad math made to look like I got some big percentage bump.\n\n\nI then talked to my mentor on the phone about it and I was pissed at my director.  I felt betrayed by my director.  He in the past had been there for me and came through.  I feel ashamed like I did something wrong and fear this will come back on me like I AM the one in the wrong.\n\n\nMy company is going through some financial issues and others have had issues with being pushed around.  I think at least 50% of the office has left, been fired or laid off.  I get the environment but I just never thought it would happen in our group. I thought my director had my back and now I fear my current manager thinks I am a liar.   \nI’m leaving now obviously but am waiting for the right opportunity to come along so I still work there.  I’ve read online, even with a bad employer, you should leave on good terms which I plan to.  I do want to maintain my pride, my confidence, my legacy, and my reputation.  I’ve worked hard at this job and I’ve done a good job.  I’m might work with either of these people again in my career, what advise can you give me?",

    "text": "Did I fuck up in this strange situation when applying for a job? A few months ago I applied for a job at a large Telecom company in the US for a software engineering position. A good friend of mine also applied for the same team but for a senior position, since he was also interested in this particular group. After two phone interviews and two on-site interviews over a few months things were looking great. The hiring manager liked me and so did the director. This is where things got weird.\n\nLast week I got an email from the HR rep and he told me to send him some information that he needed. I called him the next morning to ask him some questions about the information he needed and as soon as I greeted him he told me that I have an offer with the company. He told me about the compensation which was about double what I currently make in total compensation. Obviously I was ecstatic! However two weird things happened: the first was that he got my email wrong. I corrected him with the right email. The second was that he told me my hiring manager was the boss of the one it was supposed to be, who is the director of the department. I had an interview with her as well and I thought he just made a small mistake and brushed it off. He asked if I wanted to accept and I said I'd need to see the formal offer first so he said he would send it in the coming days but that he would send an email with some basic information about the compensation in the meantime.\n\nThe following morning I realized what had happened. They accidentally gave me the wrong offer. For some reason the HR rep mistook me for my friend who also applied there and he gave me his email by accident, which I didn't realize until the following morning because I was so excited to get the offer. I called the HR rep back to tell him of the mistake and he said he was very sorry and that they gave me the offer of a member of the senior management by mistake and that they were still working on my offer.\n\nSince the HR rep gave me my friends email I called him to let him know about the mix-up. I also emailed my hiring manager's boss (who the HR rep said would be my manager) and explained that I think there was a mixup and that I potentially received the offer of my friend since the HR rep gave me his email.\n\nThe director of the department, who is my actual hiring managers boss, emailed me back and acknowledged the HR reps mistake but also said it was extremely inappropriate of me to assume that they sent me another potential candidates offer... It seemed like they were trying to pin the blame on me.\n\nAt this point I emailed her back apologizing that I named the candidate by name... But I also mentioned that I received my friends email from the HR rep over the phone.\n\nIt's been 3 days now and the HR rep will no longer answer my phone calls and the director did not answer my email.\n\nI'm wondering, did I fuck up here? I don't feel like I did anything wrong but both my parents and my friend think I fucked up... I was really excited to work here as well and I feel like my chances are now ruined...\n\nEdit: Typos",

    "text": "MTax or JD - career advice Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm hoping to get a bit of career advice. I've been with PwC in Canada for about 3.5 years in their US/Canadian corporate group. I will be moving to a major city in US and joining another Big 4 in the corporate/partnership tax group (compliance, consulting, provisions) at the end of May. I will be completing my CPA shortly. \n\nI have been looking at a few education options after I complete my CPA. In particular, I've looked at the following:\n\n1. Master of Tax at Golden Gate University (online) - generally well regarded/known by employers in the area, part-time program that can be finished in 4-5 years. I'm unsure of the time commitment, but I imagine I should be able to manage 2 courses a year (taking the semester during busy season off). I get the feeling that this program is geared toward people doing compliance and maybe a bit of consulting?\n\n2. JD at Concord Law School - online JD program that would allow me to practice law in California. Time commitment is estimated at 25-30 hours per week, which seems like it would be almost impossible to manage with work. I do like the idea of getting a JD, but it's hard to see why taking courses on criminal law would be applicable to tax. Would it be better for my tax career to do something more focused? It's unlikely that I would want to practice law in the future.\n\n3. Master of Studies in Law (MSL) in Taxation at NYU (online) - I have an interest in both tax and law, so this seems to me like it would be a mix between options 1 and 2. However, looking at the course descriptions, they seem similar to the Master of Tax program at Golden Gate. Would there be any difference in employers eyes between a MTax and the MSL in Taxation? Being from NYU, I imagine that it would be more highly regarded?\n\nMy career goals are a bit undecided at the moment, as I have interest in doing M&A type work (structuring deals, etc.), or international/cross-border given my background in Canadian and US work. I would also be interested in industry work, in a senior manager or director of tax role. \n\nI'm interested in thoughts as to what would be the best program to take to advance my career in tax, as well as any other general advice. Any program would have to be online as I would like to keep working during my studies, and so that my employer can pay for it. :)",

    "text": "Does anybody here have a sibling who contributes to the Black dating issues? I mean the typical issues like the idea that non Black women/men are better than Black people. My brother is this way. He's 32 years old and single and has really low self esteem so I feel bad for him in that way and race issues towards black men bother him a lot. But when I'm with him, he stares at non Black women *nonstop* like his entire body and head will turn so he can check out a woman walking by but a Black female walks by and it's almost like he tries to look away. He proudly tells his friends (none of them are Black) that he's \"pickier with Black girls\" and that she'd have to be a perfect 10 for him to notice... but he's not exactly the perfect 10 type of guy, and his standards for other races are so low. He will date very homely, overweight or just bland looking White, Latina and Asian women. Even then, he doesn't attract many women because he doesn't take care of himself much, physically & that adds to his low self esteem. He also stares at couples who are interracial with a Black man a lot. I tried to hook him up with my friend but I felt bad because she was the one who asked and she's black/brown skinned and I knew he'd not like that.  I'm a Black female, it just feels disrespectful in a way, like his mind is so twisted when it comes to race and I don't understand it other than deep insecurity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe also says the \"I think she's mixed\" thing when he finds a Black girl he finds attractive, which makes me cringe. Our mother is dark skinned, our dad is multiracial and very light but loves dark skinned women like my mom. My brother is darker like my mom but myself and my other siblings are all lighter tones. He seems the most affected by his race in a negative way. We also grew up in a majority white city but this issue seems beyond that. Should I just continue to ignore this? A part of me just wants to pick his brain and ask him *why* he seems to hate Black women so much... I've been reading up more on Black female issues, especially colorism and they're annoying me, so to have a brother who so openly adds to them is driving me insane. But then I feel like I can't change him, he's allowed to have his thoughts... idk. Anybody experience similar? Any suggestions?",

    "text": "Telling our own stories, and our short film 'Ella\" Hi there,\n\nMy name is Dan Chen, and I'm a director and cinematographer. You may have seen a post about our film \"Ella\" a few weeks ago, when we had just launched our Kickstarter. I'm happy to announce that we've reached our funding goal, and we're going full steam ahead!\n\nIn recent years, I recall a conversation I had with several other friends who work in film. We came to the conclusion that any American movie with an Asian protagonist would most likely be categorized as an \"Asian\" movie, or a special interest film.\n\n\"What if I wanted to make something like Dazed and Confused, but the main characters just so happen to be Asian American?\"\n\n\"It's still going to be an Asian movie.\"\n\nThe question stayed with me. Maybe I hadn't fully embraced my own race and identity yet. But I didn't want to make a special interest movie. I just wanted to make a movie.\n\nIt took a lot of inspiration to get to making \"Ella.\" Part of it was seeing artistic, successful minority representation in media, with projects like Master of None and Moonlight paving the way. Another factor was my friend Doug Kim, a producer on our short, writing and starring in a pilot we worked on together, which dealt with his real struggles as an Asian American actor in a courageous and comedic way. Finally, I realized that any character driven story needs to take race into consideration, just as it should explore sex, class, age, and other very real factors that affect who we are and who we become.\n\nIn my view, we can't wait for Hollywood to cast Asian Americans in an interesting, complex way, although putting pressure on them can certainly make them reconsider their actions. We need more Asian creators, just as we need more black creators, more Hispanic creators, and most obviously, more women of all kinds in Hollywood. Because these creators will understand the importance and significance of representation.\n\nPlus they'd have experiences and perspectives that we haven't seen yet. That's not just good social justice... that's good entertainment.\n\nSo this short film is my humble contribution (and if all goes well, the first of many contributions). I'd love support, critique, or sharing if you dig the project. We're currently going for our first stretch goal which would afford us the opportunity to hire a great casting director to help us find our second lead, who'd play a fourteen year old Chinese boy who's seeking acceptance in his small Midwestern town.\n\n[Ella, a new coming of age story in the Midwest](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dchen/ella-a-new-american-coming-of-age-story-in-the-mid)\n\nI'm glad to be a subscriber to the community, and look forward to sharing more dialogues and upvotes with ya'll.\n\ncheers,\nDan",

    "text": "Enrollments, budgets fall short at universities known for ‘social justice warfare’  more people are getting the message. not attending these indoctrination centres is more effective. less students less revenue.\n............................................\n\nhttp://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/sep/14/enrollment-drops-at-schools-known-for-social-justi/\n\nUniversities known for being hotbeds of campus protest and liberal activism are struggling with declining enrollments and budget shortfalls, and higher education analysts say that’s no coincidence.\nTake Oberlin College. According to a document leaked to The Oberlin Review, the school’s student newspaper, the small liberal arts college famous for social justice hoaxes has had trouble attracting and retaining students, missing this year’s enrollment mark by 80 and racking up a $5 million budget deficit in the process.\nWilliam A. Jacobson, a professor at Cornell Law School who runs the Legal Insurrection blog, said the “most obvious culprit” in Oberlin’s dwindling admissions is “relentless social justice warfare.”\n\n“Social justice warfare at Oberlin has been more intense and sustained over a longer period of time than at most schools, and has come to define Oberlin in the media,” Mr. Jacobson said. “The resulting mockery and derision, even in liberal publications, has damaged the Oberlin brand.”\nSurveys support the notion that, in the era of Trump, conservatives have become more skeptical about the value of a college degree.\nThe polarizing presidential election was felt in the dip in applicants at some top-tier colleges such as Ohio’s Kenyon College.\n\n“This is a year in which you were vulnerable if you were a small liberal arts college in a rural red state and you attract a significant portion of your student body from the East Coast or West Coast, which would certainly be the case with Kenyon,” Diane Anci, Kenyon’s vice president of enrollment and dean of admissions and financial aid, told the Ohio school’s Kenyon Collegian newspaper.\nA study published by the Washington-based Pew Research Center in July found that just 36 percent of Republicans believe colleges and universities have a positive effect on the country, down from 54 percent two years ago.\nGallup released a poll in August that found just 33 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning respondents had a “great deal or quite a lot of confidence in higher education.” Sixty-seven percent said they have “some or very little” confidence in academia.\nHigh school counselors report that, in the past few years, parents have been more likely to express concern about sending their children to schools with progressive reputations.\n“Many won’t consider Oberlin or Wesleyan, and Brown is completely off the table,” one counselor told Inside Higher Education in June.\n\nThe problem may be especially pronounced among the nation’s heartland. Inside Higher Education reports that several prestigious, small liberal arts colleges in the Midwest have missed their enrollment marks this year.\nSome college administrators have taken notice. According to Inside Higher Education’s annual survey, 52 percent of admissions directors from public colleges and 28 percent from private ones said they were stepping up their recruitment of students from rural areas in the wake of the presidential race.\nDeclining enrollments have previously been observed at colleges and universities that became notorious for chaotic campus activism, including the University of Missouri and Evergreen State College.\nBy some estimates, enrollment at the former is down 35 percent since fall 2015, when student protests helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement.\nMeanwhile, Evergreen faces a $2.1 million budget shortfall this year since students took over the campus last spring, barricading themselves in the library, berating administrators on a regular basis and forcing one dissenting professor to teach off campus out of fear for his safety.\nA spokesperson for Oberlin College did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Times.\nThe school’s problems cannot be traced to a single incident but to several.\nIn February 2013, mass hysteria ensued after racist and anti-Semitic flyers and graffiti began to appear all over campus. Classes were canceled, meetings were held and students began to see racism around every corner, including when someone reported seeing a member of the Ku Klux Klan on campus. It turned out to be a woman walking around wrapped in a blanket to keep warm.\nNot only that, the perpetrators behind the racist paraphernalia turned out to be two progressive students, one of whom was confirmed to be an Obama supporter, trying to get a reaction out of their classmates and the administration.\nRather than admit the whole thing was a hoax and move on, the Oberlin administration doubled down on a social justice agenda, including the implementation of a privilege and oppression “reorientation” for first-year students.\nIn the ensuing years, Oberlin students would go on to make frequent demands of the university, ranging from the end of culturally appropriated meals at the dining hall, such as General Tso’s chicken and sushi, to the elimination of grades below a C.\nIn 2015, after the University of Missouri protests, the Oberlin Black Student Union issued a 14-page letter making 50 demands of the administration. They included exclusive “safe spaces” for black students and the elimination of graduation requirements for classes in Western civilization.\nLast November, Oberlin students targeted Gibson’s Bakery, a beloved store in Oberlin, Ohio, after an employee called police when he saw someone attempting to shoplift by concealing two bottles of wine under his jacket. The accused shoplifter turned out to be a black Oberlin student.\nThe Black Student Union, Oberlin Student Senate and College Democrats spearheaded a boycott of the bakery and organized protests outside of the store. Even the Oberlin administration, responding to calls from Black Lives Matter supporters on campus, stopped purchasing goods from the bakery.\nThree students involved in the incident ended up pleading guilty to attempted theft and aggravated trespassing. As part of a plea deal, the students acknowledged that the bakery’s actions were “not racially motivated” and that the store was “merely trying to prevent an underage sale.”\nMost of the enrollment deficit at Oberlin came from a smaller-than-expected freshman class, which totaled 742 instead of a projected 805.\nPeter Wood, president of the National Association of Scholars, said that drop-off is more serious than it may appear.\n“That doesn’t sound like an astonishing number of people not coming, but weighed on a percentage basis, that’s a huge drop in just one year,” Mr. Wood said. “And Oberlin has for some time been struggling to make its classes. This wasn’t just some negligence: ‘Oh, we didn’t realize that we had to try harder to get students.’ They’ve been trying really hard to get students, and students just aren’t coming.”\nHe said Oberlin can easily recoup the $5 million deficit by cutting the “apparatus of political correctness” that has swelled in the past several years. When that happens, he said, it will be a sign that the school is serious about reform.\n“The signal that I would look for is when they begin to divest from the large number of personnel who are employed wholly because of their political orientations,” he said. “When that happens, I think we will have seen a college that has decided to reposition itself in the market. Until then, it’s all just show.”",

    "text": "A Socialist Defense of Gender Roles Edit: wow.  I've never seen such quick downvotes.   Remember that this is supposed to be a discussion forum not an ideological purity contest.   Only downvote if you think this post has contributed nothing to the debate.   \n\nEdit 2: I give up.   Enjoy the decline.   \n\nUnusual and long post here.    The non-socialist majority may enjoy it for the stats and the un-pc quotes by figures like George Orwell, Nicola Tesla and Christopher Hitchens.  \n\nMRA's are right to suggest that men got a raw deal under traditionalism.    I'm not suggesting we go back to a situation where e.g. a man be forced to pay his wives' debts.   Or that people be forced into certain roles.   I'm suggesting that the majority of men and women would be happier in a traditionalist arrangement: the woman takes care of the kids and home and the man is respected and honored for his contributions in turn.   Nor would this prevent women from achieving status in the male sphere.   It would just be more unusual since women would be doing the more important work of raising children.\n\nA return to a traditional conservative lifestyle is impossible absent collapse.   Female liberation has [never](https://archive.org/details/b20442580) been internally reversed.   Unfortunately it is also incompatible with large inequalities due to female hypergamy.    The majority of men are left out in the cold, so have no impetus to work.  Therefore a combination of men's rights and socialism are required if civilization is to continue.   This will naturally lead to men and women embracing traditional gender roles.    The only other alternative is a return to patriarchy, however that is exceedingly unlikely for reasons JD Unwin explains in the above link.   \n\nI was recently watching a documentary about a financial depression in the late 19th century.   A (female) professor noted that \"many women were forced\" into the workplace.   It struck me as an odd turn of phrase, since feminists claim that women weren't \"allowed\" to work back then.   Turns out this is false.   Karen Straughan notes that there are records e.g. of female blacksmiths going back to the middle ages.   Women could work, they just didn't want to.   Why would they?   For 90 percent of the population working sucked.   It still does.  Also, it's hard to work when you're pregnant.   \n\nThe only way feminists can get away with characterizing the traditional female sphere as a prison is by lying about it.   In truth, women could own [property](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/continuity-and-change/article/favoured-or-oppressed-married-women-property-and-coverture-in-england-16601800/617F23DD2D64A036C58E0BF7D56F89BE), wife-beating was severely [punished](https://www.debunker.com/texts/ruleofthumb.html), and women were respected for their role in society.    Alexis de Tocqueville commented on the essential equality of the male and female spheres in Democracy in America (1840) :\n\n“Americans,” he said, did not think that men and women should perform the same tasks, “but they show an equal regard for both their perspective parts; and though their lot is different, they consider both of them as being of equal value.”\n\nWomen have ALWAYS been greatly respected by men for being mothers and nurturers.   What is a more important job than raising a child?   It was only a small number of envious man-haters that decided otherwise.   \n\nThe feminist movement appears to have arisen not do to \"oppression\" but boredom.   Rich women lived lives of luxury most men could only dream of, but they were envious of the social status of their doctor and lawyer male relatives.   They wanted the privileges of both the female and male spheres.  They wanted to \"have it all\".\n\nA number of intellectuals expressed concern, though not as many as you'd expect considering the enormity of what feminists were proposing.   The socialist Earnest Belford Bax claimed that women were already the [privileged sex](https://archive.org/details/fraudoffeminism00baxerich).    The socialist Mother Jones, who spent most of her time organizing male coal miners and fighting child labor, considered it absurd that women could be \"liberated\" by work.   And Nicola Tesla, one of the most brilliant men who ever lived, predicted that \"equality\" between men and women would quickly lead to female superiority and massive social dysfunction: \n\n\"This struggle of the human female toward sex equality will end in a new sex order, with the female as superior. The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race.\"\n\nThe Catholic GK Chesterton, who embraced socialist ideas about land reform, suggested that mixing the traditional male and female spheres would be a disaster for society.   \n\nThis [article](http://gkcdaily.blogspot.com/2015/03/chesterton-notorious-anti-feminist.html) provides a decent summary.   \n\n>Woman is wrong, he considers, to try to adapt herself to society by making a man of herself. The contrary should come about—Society should adapt itself to womanhood by becoming gentler. To Feminists, he acknowledges that women undergo a revolting tyranny in factories; but he wanted to destroy the factories, while they, he felt, were content with destroying womanhood.\n\n\"The virtues of the Family and Home, due to free choice and limitation, form the basic cell of the social organism. Banish the spirit of Home, and you suppress the very possibility of a sanely constituted society.\"\n\nChesterton advocated wealth redistribution to the poor so that women wouldn't have to work.   George Orwell, who despite popular belief was a socialist, recommended the same: \n\n\"Far more drastically than anyone has proposed hitherto, taxation will have to be graded so as to encourage child-bearing and to save women with young children from being obliged to work outside the home (CW 16, 223).\"\n\n\"This, of course, is a subject of great interest in India, and roughly what we want discussed is how far women benefit by escaping from home and whether in the long run it is desirable for them to undertake the same work as men” (CW 13, 474).\n\nFeminists set about to destroy the \"patriarchal\" family, but they had nothing to replace it with.   We are not living in hunter-gatherer societies; the idea that the \"whole tribe\" would raise children has amounted instead to children being stuck all day in daycares and classrooms.   Women aren't able to spend as much time with their children as they'd like: they're too busy working.   They have replaced loving husbands with asshole bosses.   In a tragic irony, the \"new American dream\" for women is to become a [housewife](https://www.forbes.com/sites/meghancasserly/2012/09/12/is-opting-out-the-new-american-dream-for-working-women/#3c1b00ad623a).     \n\nThe single mother experiment has been a disaster.    Feminists assumed that men were only needed for their wallets, whereas it turns out that that males are [crucial](http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/family/experts-say-father-s-involvement-pivotal-proper-child-rearing) at every stage of child rearing.   The statistics for children raised by single mothers are nothing short of horrific.  \n\nWhat about men?   Men no longer feel like they have a role to fulfill, so are increasingly dropping out of society.   Suicides are at all time high.   Drug and alcohol addiction is rampant.    \n\nBy privileging girls in school and women in work, young women are now out-earning young men.   This leads to women being unable to find what they consider suitable partners due to hypergamy.  \n\nWomen have become ever more hateful and spiteful toward men.   Part of this is due to feminist lies, part of this is due to being forced to compete with the opposite sex.   The sexes aren't supposed to compete with one another; that's not how we were designed.   We're supposed to be complementary.  Since male leaders don't want to compete with women, they gave them ever more privileges at the expense of men.    So much for patriarchy theory.  \n\nAnd now we find the reason why being a housewife is the new American dream: Research has found that stay-at-home mothers are [happier](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3634473/The-job-makes-happiest-Housewife-Survey-finds-stay-home-mothers-satisfied-profession.html) than those who work (female unhappiness is actually at an all time high).   So the whole feminist experiment was a gigantic waste of time.   More than that, it was a potentially fatal social experiment.    \n\nWomen who don't have children are more likely to get [cancer](http://www.everydayhealth.com/womens-health-specialist/childless-women-and-cancer.aspx).   The same applies to women who wait until their thirties to have children (the current trend).    Fewer and fewer women are giving birth.   Since population levels are unsustainable, more and more immigration is required.   This, in turn, leads to increased mistrust in communities.    The ruling class is able to play off workers against one another with ease, preventing solidarity.  \n\nMale creative genius is ignored and suppressed instead of being nurtured.    And for what?   So women can become unhappier?  \n\nIn The Red Pill, Warren Farrell emphasizes flexibility of roles.   But women don't seem to want flexibility for men.   They become resentful of stay at home dads.   They recoil at men expressing emotions.   They refuse to \"date down.\"   They demand all of their traditional privileges.  \n\nThe association between communism and feminism arose mostly from Marx's benefactor Friedrich Engels.   However it is interesting that many of the early socialists rejected his views on the subject and had no problem with traditional gender roles.    They didn't think women should be *forced* to be housewives, but as mentioned, only rich women were privileged enough to conceive of work as liberation.   \n\nFeminists have re-engineered society but it has not helped either men or women.   In the Israeli Kibbutz, which embraces an anarchic form of social organization, people were not given any gender roles but naturally became the most traditionalist society in the world.   This leads me to believe that the vast majority of both men and women prefer behaving like men and women.   We have created a society that ignores the happiness of the 99% and caters to outliers among both sexes -- in particular lesbians.    These outliers should not be oppressed, but they shouldn't dictate how the rest of us behave either.  \n\nIf it is respect and independence women are after, men's rights combined with traditional gender roles would allow them to have both.   They would be respected as mothers, would still be allowed to enter the male sphere if they wished (though only on equal terms -- no feminist bullshit), and wouldn't have to suffer being wage slaves.   They would not be able to simply divorce the man and take the kids and his money, so marriages would remain intact.   Men would likewise be able to act as men again, without being demonized; they would be respected and honored for the work they do to maintain civilization, and would have all the rights that women currently have.   \n\nEgalitarian economics would ensure that the majority of men not be excluded from romance due to hypergamy.   \n\nBonus: Christopher Hitchens: Women shouldn't have to work.  \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQas34criFo",

    "text": "Hooked on bell hooks, part 3: \"Consciousness-raising: a constant change of heart\" (from \"Feminism is for everybody\", 2000) Enjoy this bite-sized excerpt from bell hooks' book \"Feminism is for Everybody\"\n\n[Author page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks)\n\n[Amazon - book reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332#customerReviews)\n\nPlease post below your thoughts and comments on this text!\n\n***\n\n\"**Consciousness-raising: A Constant Change of Heart**\n\nFeminists are made, not born. One does not become an advocate of feminist politics simply by having the privilege of having been born female. Like all political positions one becomes a believer in feminist politics through choice and action. When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference being simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege. Before women could change patriarchy we had to change ourselves; we had to raise our consciousness.\n\nRevolutionary feminist consciousness-raising emphasized the importance of learning about patriarchy as a system of domination, how it became institutionalized and how it is perpetuated and maintained. Understanding the way male domination and sexism was expressed in everyday life created awareness in women of the ways we were victimized, exploited, and, in worse case scenarios, oppressed. Early on in contemporary feminist movement, consciousness-raising groups often became settings where women simply unleashed pent-up hostility and rage about being victimized, with little or no focus on strategies of intervention and transformation. On a basic level many hurt and exploited women used the consciousness-raising group therapeutically. It was the site where they uncovered and openly revealed the depths of their intimate wounds. This confessional aspect served as a healing ritual. Through consciousness-raising women gained the strength to challenge patriarchal forces at work and at home.\n\nImportantly though, the foundation of this work began with women examining sexist thinking and creating strategies where we would change our attitudes and belief via a conversion to feminist thinking and a commitment to feminist politics. Fundamentally, the consciousness-raising (CR) group was a site for conversion. To build a mass-based feminist movement women needed to organize. The consciousness-raising session, which usually took place in someone’s home (rather than public space that had to be rented or donated), was the meeting place. It was the place where seasoned feminist thinkers and activists could recruit new converts. Importantly, communication and dialogue was a central agenda at the consciousness-raising sessions. In many groups a policy was in place which honored everyone’s voice. Women took turns speaking to make sure everyone would be heard. This attempt to create a non-hierarchal model for discussion positively gave every woman a chance to speak but often did not create a context for engaged dialogue. However, in most instances discussion and debate occurred, usually after everyone had spoken at least once.\n\nArgumentative discussion was common in CR groups as it was the way we sought to clarify our collective understanding of the nature of male domination. Only through discussion and disagreement could we begin to find a realistic standpoint on gender exploitation and oppression.\n\nAs feminist thinking, which emerged first in the context of small groups where individuals often knew each other (they may have worked together and/ or were friends), began to be theorized in printed matter so as to reach a wider audience, groups dismantled. The creation of women’s studies as an academic discipline provided another setting where women could be informed about feminist thinking and feminist theory. Many of the women who spearheaded the introduction of women’s studies classes into colleges and universities had been radical activists in civil rights struggles, gay rights, and early feminist movement. Many of them did not have doctorates, which meant that they entered academic institutions receiving lower pay and working longer hours than their colleagues in other disciplines. By the time younger graduate students joined the effort to legitimize feminist scholarship in the academy we knew that it was important to gain higher degrees. Most of us saw our commitment to women’s studies as political action; we were prepared to sacrifice in order to create an academic base for feminist movement.\n\nBy the late ‘70s women’s studies was on its way to becoming an accepted academic discipline. This triumph overshadowed the fact that many of the women who had paved the way for the institutionalization of women’s studies were fired because they had master’s degrees and not doctorates. While some of us returned to graduate school to get PhDs, some of the best and brightest among us did not because they were utterly disillusioned with the university and burnt out from overwork as well as disappointed and enraged that the radical politics undergirding women’s studies was being replaced by liberal reformism. Before too long the women’s studies classroom had replaced the free-for-all consciousness-raising group.\n\nWhereas women from various backgrounds, those who worked solely as housewives or in service jobs, and big-time professional women, could be found in diverse consciousness-raising groups, the academy was and remains a site of class privilege. Privileged white middle-class women who were a numeric majority though not necessarily the radical leaders of contemporary feminist movement often gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle. Women with revolutionary feminist consciousness, many of them lesbian and from working-class backgrounds, often lost visibility as the movement received mainstream attention. Their displacement became complete once women’s studies became entrenched in colleges and universities which are conservative corporate structures. Once the women’s studies classroom replaced the consciousness-raising group as the primary site for the transmission of feminist thinking and strategies for social change the movement lost its mass-based potential.\n\nSuddenly more and more women began to either call themselves “feminists” or use the rhetoric of gender discrimination to change their economic status. The institutionalization of feminist studies created a body of jobs both in the world of the academy and in the world of publishing. These careerbased changes led to forms of career opportunism wherein women who had never been politically committed to mass-based feminist struggle adopted the stance and jargon of feminism when it enhanced their class mobility. The dismantling of consciousness-raising groups all but erased the notion that one had to learn about feminism and make an informed choice about embracing feminist politics to become a feminist advocate.\n\nWithout the consciousness-raising group as a site where women confronted their own sexism towards other women, the direction of feminist movement could shift to a focus on equality in the workforce and confronting male domination. With heightened focus on the construction of woman as a “victim” of gender equality deserving of reparations (whether through changes in discriminatory laws or affirmative action policies) the idea that women needed to first confront their internalized sexism as part of becoming feminist lost currency. Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING 11ten gained prominence because they were the group mass media focused on as representatives of the struggle.

Females of all ages acted as though concern for or rage at male domination or gender equality was all that was needed to make one a “feminist.” Without confronting internalized sexism women who picked up the feminist banner often betrayed the cause in their interactions with other women.\n\nBy the early ‘80s the evocation of a politicized sisterhood, so crucial at the onset of the feminist movement, lost meaning as the terrain of radical feminist politics was overshadowed by a lifestyle based feminism which suggested any woman could be a feminist no matter what her political beliefs. Needless to say such thinking has undermined feminist theory and practice, feminist politics. When feminist movement renews itself, reinforcing again and again the strategies that will enable a mass movement to end sexism and sexist exploitation and oppression for everyone, consciousness-raising will once again attain its original importance. Effectively imitating the model of AA meetings, feminist consciousness-raising groups will take place in communities, offering the message of feminist thinking to everyone irrespective of class, race, or gender. While specific groups based on shared identities might emerge, at the end of every month individuals would be in mixed groups.\n\nFeminist consciousness-raising for males is as essential to revolutionary movement as female groups. Had there been an emphasis on groups for males that taught boys and men about what sexism is and how it can be transformed, it would have been impossible for mass media to portray the movement as anti-male. It would also have preempted the formation of an anti-feminist men’s movement. Often men’s groups were formed in the wake of contemporary feminism that in no way addressed the issues of sexism and male domination. Like the lifestyle-based feminism aimed at women these groups often became therapeutic settings for men to confront their wounds without a critique of patriarchy or a platform of resistance to male domination. Future feminist movement will not make this mistake. Males of all ages need settings where their resistance to sexism is affirmed and valued. Without males as allies in struggle feminist movement will not progress. As it is we have to do so much work to correct the assumption deeply embedded in the cultural psyche that feminism is anti-male. Feminism is anti-sexism. A male who has divested of male privilege, who has embraced feminist politics, is a worthy comrade in struggle, in no way a threat to feminism, whereas a female who remains wedded to sexist thinking and behavior infiltrating feminist movement is a dangerous threat. Significantly, the most powerful intervention made by consciousness-raising groups was the demand that all females confront their internalized sexism, their allegiance to patriarchal thinking and action, and their commitment to feminist conversion. That intervention is still needed. It remains the necessary step for anyone choosing feminist politics. The enemy within must be transformed before we can confront the enemy outside. The threat, the enemy, is sexist thought and behavior. **As long as females take up the banner of feminist politics without addressing and transforming their own sexism, ultimately the movement will be undermined**.\"",
