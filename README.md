# **Temporal Bias Analysis in Reddit Discourse (2017–2023)**  

This project investigates **how social bias evolves in online language** by examining Reddit discussions across major sociopolitical events using multiple sentiment analysis models (**BERT**, **DistilBERT**, **RoBERTa**, and **TextBlob**).

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Objective** | Quantify how expressions of **gendered and racial bias** shift before and after major social movements such as #MeToo, COVID-19, and Black Lives Matter. |
| **Dataset** | 6,000 Reddit posts collected, filtered to 2,634 high-quality samples for analysis. |
| **Models Tested** | BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, TextBlob (lexicon-based). |
| **Intersections Studied** | Gender × Profession (e.g., *woman doctor*, *man engineer*) and Race × Authority (e.g., *black judge*, *white CEO*). |
| **Periodization** | Pre-#MeToo (2017) → Post-#MeToo (2019) → COVID Era (2021) → Post-BLM (2023). |
| **Outputs** | Temporal heatmaps, bias amplification scores, model comparison dashboards, and validation metrics. |

## ⚙️ **Methodology**

1. **Data Collection**  
    Reddit posts scraped via PRAW from 20+ discussion forums (e.g., `r/AskReddit`, `r/TwoXChromosomes`, `r/engineering`, `r/medicine`) 
    Texts filtered for co-occurrence of **demographic** and **professional** markers using a curated bias lexicon  

2. **Model Evaluation**  
    Sentiment computed via four models  
    Intersectional results aggregated per demographic pair  

3. **Statistical Validation**  
    **Chi-square independence tests** → measure significance of sentiment shifts
    **Cohen’s d effect sizes** → quantify direction and magnitude of change

4. **Bias Metrics Computed**  
    Stereotype amplification (vs. baseline societal stereotypes) 
    Consistency index (variance within groups)
    Temporal drift (year-wise change in polarity)

## 📊 **Key Findings**

 **Gendered Bias Reduction (Post-#MeToo):**  
  Female-profession pairs such as *woman doctor* and *woman engineer* show a measurable **15–20% increase in positive sentiment** relative to 2017 baselines.  

 **Racial Bias Persistence (Post-BLM):**  
  Despite increased visibility, *black CEO* and *black judge* pairs remain **consistently undervalued** in sentiment polarity scores.  

 **Model Divergence:**  
  Transformer-based models (BERT/DistilBERT) detect subtler contextual bias than lexicon-based models (VADER/TextBlob), as seen in the figure below.
